Saying it changed your life might be a bit much; maybe it was just your first Chenin Blanc after a life of Chardonnay or a glass that excited you in a way you thought only the brush of a crush\u2019s hand could. Perhaps it was both. But it affected you like no other wine had before, forever altering how you experienced wine from that point on. Mine was Olivier Lemasson\u2019s \u201cR-13,\u201d and it did in fact change my life.It was fall of 2014, back when wine was a hobby I couldn\u2019t afford. I stopped at Domaine LA after work, asking for something under $20, like I always did. At the shop, $19 felt like a splurge but at home that night, that bottle of \u201cR-13\u201d was worth a million to me. The red blend of Grolleau, Gamay and C\u00f4t (the fancy French word for Malbec) from the Loire Valley was a thrilling bait and switch that smelled like wet Redwoods in a barnyard, covered by flowering star jasmine. And it tasted like the dusty, brambly blackberries bursting with juice I used to pick in Mariposa\u2014sprinkled in sea-salt\u2014with acidity that zipped quicker than jeans in a lover\u2019s bedroom. Puzzling and blood-pumping, I must have drunk a case of it; every bottle a juicy rabbit hole that pushed me to pay undivided attention to each note yet inevitably drink it for pure pleasure. It was the wine that made me obsessed with France, the wine that made me understand Brettanomyces, and the wine that made me dedicate myself to natural wine.The next year I went searching for my beloved \u201cR-13\u201d only to find out there was never going to be another \u201cR-13.\u201d While I knew the \u201cR\u201d was for Rouge, to signify an ever-changing blend, I hadn\u2019t put together that the \u201c13\u201d was for the vintage. Undeterred, I bought six bottles of the \u201cR-14.\u201d It was good. The \u201cR-15\u201d was too ripe and chocolatey for me, a reflection of the heat that plagued the 2015 vintage across most of France. I liked the \u201cR-16\u201d and \u201cR-17\u201d but still, they weren\u2019t the same.I understood the influence and importance of vintage well by now and had come to accept that there would never be another wine like Olivier Lemasson\u2019s \u201cR-13.\u201d My thoughts echoed the last scene of Chinatown: \u201cForget it Ross, this is Natural Wine.\u201dThen Oliver Lemasson\u2019s \u201cR-18\u201d hit the shelves this year. The \u201cR-18\u201d is a blend of Grolleau and C\u00f4t and glimmers like a ruby in the sun. It smells like ripe cherries and tart plums ground with a limestone mortar and pestle and seasoned with white pepper. It\u2019s light bodied with the same spicy yet mineral-driven red fruit from the nose, but with a heavy wave of raspberries, splashes of strawberry, and chewy notes of blackcurrant with tannins that linger softly like a fond, old memory. That memory was of my dearest \u201cR-13.\u201dI wouldn\u2019t be here as I am today if it wasn\u2019t for Olivier Lemasson\u2019s \u201cR-13\u201d and all the \u201cR\u201ds that have come since.And I can\u2019t say why. They\u2019re different blends, different tasting notes. The \u201cR-13\u201d was Bretty, the \u201cR-18\u201d is well-balanced. But I bought at least a case of the \u201cR-18,\u201d and each bottle took me back to those moments before I ever thought about wine as a career, when I wrote about bottles simply because I loved to, when I wasn\u2019t an author or a wine editor or a verified Instagram and a commodity in the wine industry and a pawn in their politics. It\u2019s an energy, a feeling, a knowingness I discovered in a glass that changed the trajectory of my life forever, and five years later has been reignited and reaffirmed by the same winemaker in a different wine. I wouldn\u2019t be here as I am today if it wasn\u2019t for Olivier Lemasson\u2019s \u201cR-13\u201d and all the \u201cR\u201ds that have come since.So, dear reader with that one wine, you may have loved but you have not lost. Every vintage will be different, whether it\u2019s because of the weather, the specific grapes used or maybe the winemaker changed up their vinification process. But you owe it to yourself, as well as that one wine and its winemaker, to stick with it. Different vintages allow you to contrast, to compare, to learn and to be truly surprised. And appreciative, when that one wine that changed your life comes back in a new glass to remind you exactly why it did.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishUnfiltered essayRead MoreLifestyleIf You Try One Greek Wine This Fall, Make It ThisBy Marissa A.
