Food Styling by Kat Boytsova. \u00a0Prop Styling by Stephanie De LucaFacebookTwitterEmailWhat\u2019s better than a good recipe? When something\u2019s so easy you don\u2019t need one. In It\u2019s That Simple, we\u2019ll talk you through the dishes and drinks we make with our eyes closed. Today, malfatti.I envy people who can make all sorts of pasta by hand. Being Italian, I\u2019ve always felt I should know how to pull sticky dough into shape as if it were the most natural thing in the world. Sadly, I never quite mastered that effortlessness: Whenever I\u2019ve attempted fettuccine, gnocchi, or pici (the last two are usually considered simple enough even for beginner cooks), my kitchen has ended up covered in flour, my work surface a complete mess, and, worst of all, the pasta thick and chewy.That was, at least, until I came across malfatti: spinach and cheese dumplings somewhere between gnocchi and ravioli\u2014like a ravioli\u2019s inside.Literally translated to \u201cbadly made,\u201d this pasta is the most elemental of any homemade pastas out there\u2014something so easy to rustle up that even the most inept of pasta-makers (me) can nail it in no time. The name says it all: Malfatti don\u2019t have to be pretty, precisely cut, well-proportioned, or neatly folded. Quite the opposite. They\u2019re meant to be irregular, misshapen, and malformed\u2014and they demand nothing but a handful of ingredients you\u2019re bound to already have. Any time I want to pretend I am really good at pasta-making or I\u2019m feeding more than just myself for dinner, malfatti are on the menu.Their simplicity stems from their origins, of course: Malfatti are part of the cucina povera repertoire\u2014the humble yet remarkably resourceful \u201ccooking of the poor\u201d that comprises so much of Italian cuisine. Their birthplace is either Lombardy or Tuscany, depending on who you ask (in the latter, you\u2019ll find them under the name of gnudi, which means \u201cnaked\u201d in the local dialect\u2014a hint at the fact they don\u2019t come wrapped in dough), although as is the case with many Italian recipes, there are different iterations in other regions too. Different families are also likely to have their own versions: Some replace spinach with chicory, Swiss chard, or whatever green leafy vegetables they have on hand. Others tinker with the sauce they serve them with\u2014the \u201cofficial\u201d one being butter, Parmesan, and sage\u2014or play with the shape, which can be anything from round to oblong to slightly tapered. Regardless, malfatti ends up pillowy, with a melt-in-your mouth texture that\u2019ll have you coming back for seconds.Here's how to make spinach malfatti:To make enough for four people\u2014or two hungry ones\u2014cook 20 oz. fresh or frozen spinach in a large pot of boiling salted water just until wilted, 1\u20132 minutes (make it 8\u201310 if using frozen). Drain, let cool, then squeeze out any excess water, and chop them coarsely with a knife or a blender (skip the cutting if your frozen spinach came prechopped). The squeezing is really the only must when making malfatti: If the spinach retains too much water, chances are you\u2019ll have trouble working the dough later. So give them a powerful squeeze!In a pan, melt 1\u00bd Tbsp. butter, add 1 smashed garlic clove, and then add the spinach. Saut\u00e9 the greens gently for 5 minutes, turning them occasionally\u2014this helps bump up their flavor and staves off additional moisture. Remove from the heat, discard the garlic, and set aside to let cool.Take a large bowl, and dump in 8 oz. fresh ricotta, 2 lightly beaten eggs, 3 oz. finely grated Parmesan, and reserved spinach. Add a pinch of nutmeg and a generous amount of salt and pepper and use a spatula to combine all the ingredients. Lastly, tip in 6 oz. all-purpose flour (about 1\u2153 cups). \u00a0It\u2019s important to always add the flour last\u2014you\u2019re after a silky, soft texture here, and adding the flour last prevents the dough from getting too dry. Now mix everything with your hands until you form a malleable dough ball (don\u2019t worry if it\u2019s still pretty sticky), about 3 minutes.Once that\u2019s done, start shaping your malfatti. Flour a work surface, then take pieces of dough and roll them into an oblong shape (think gnocchi, but a bit bigger and longer). Roll each malfatti into the flour as needed to prevent sticking, then place on a lightly floured baking sheet. You\u2019ll get somewhere between 20\u201330 pieces. (You can also take the gnocchi approach: Divide the dough into four big pieces, roll each into a long log, and cut into nuggets.) Congratulations, you\u2019ve just accomplished homemade pasta.To cook the malfatti, bring a pot of salted water to a boil and drop them in. Once they rise to the surface (4\u20135 minutes), remove them from the pot with a slotted spoon or skimmer and transfer them into a saucepan where you\u2019ll have your sauce going.As I mentioned, the classic recipe calls for butter, Parmesan, and sage, so stir together some butter (half a stick, or to your liking), 2 oz. finely grated Parmesan, and a handful of sage in a pan, then gently toss the malfatti into the mixture, adding a little cooking water at a time, until you\u2019ve reach your preferred creamy consistency. Or treat this as a basic template and fancy up your pasta with whatever sauce you want: cherry tomato and basil? Why not. Peas and herbs? Don\u2019t mind if I do.Like all the best Italian food, malfatti are open to improvisation and deliver the highest level of comfort\u2014not to mention smugness. If that\u2019s not enough of a good reason to make them for dinner tonight, think about the fact you can keep them in the fridge for up to two days or even freeze the uncooked dumplings (as long as they\u2019re in an airtight container) for a homemade meal at the ready. They might not be the prettiest, but they\u2019re sure ingenious.Explore Bon App\u00e9titIt's That SimplecookingRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
