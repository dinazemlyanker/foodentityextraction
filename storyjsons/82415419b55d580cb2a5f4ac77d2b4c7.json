But what if\u2014heavens forbid\u2014you find yourself in the crappy kitchen of a vacation rental, or at the home of your friend who doesn\u2019t cook, and there is no mixer or even whisk to be found? Starting to feel like a \u201cwhipped cream emergency,\u201d isn\u2019t it? What then??Well, you make Emergency Whipped Cream, that\u2019s what.First things first: You\u2019re going to need very cold heavy cream. As in, not the pint you brought home from the store and left in the shopping bag by the door and totally forgot until now to put in the fridge. As in, not the half and half in the fridge door you\u2019re wondering if you can use instead of proper heavy cream. Very. Cold. Heavy. Cream. If you pull it out of the back of the fridge and it still feels kinda luke, put it in the freezer for 5 minutes or so until it\u2019s nice and frosty.Next, you\u2019re going to need a suitable vessel. You want a tall container with at least a 4-cup capacity and a tight-fitting lid\u2014a plastic quart container, quart-sized Mason jar, or large cocktail shaker will all work. Whatever you\u2019ve got, go ahead and pop it into the freezer for 5 minutes, too\u2014you want both the vessel and the cream to be chilly AF.That guy on the left will do nicely.\nChelsie CraigCream and container good and cold? Great. Time to make Emergency Whipped Cream. Pour about 1 cup of heavy cream into your at-least-4-cup receptacle of choice. Don't be tempted to put more in; you need to leave plenty of headspace. Secure the lid. Now comes the fun part: Shake the hell out of it. (Note: If you went the plastic quart container route, you\u2019re going to need to hold the lid down with your thumbs as you do this.) Shake! Shake! Shake! Harder is not necessarily better\u2014you want to shake confidently, at a pace you can keep consistently without having to stop. Listen closely to the sound the cream makes as it gets pummeled back and forth; over the course of a couple of minutes, it\u2019ll progress from a glug-glug-glug to a deeper whump-whump-whump, and that\u2019s your cue to stop. Open the container and take a peek. Does it look loose, like not-whipped cream? Close the lid and keep shaking! Does it look like soft, beautifully aerated whipped cream? Well then you just made Emergency Whipped Cream my friend.How cool was that?? If you\u2019re so inclined, use a spoon to gently fold in a teaspoon or so of powdered sugar or maple syrup and a small pinch of salt, or gussy it up otherwise with whatever spices or flavorings you\u2019re interested in. (Personally, I like the contrast that unadulterated, au naturel whipped cream lends to something sweet, but you do you.) Bring your container of creamy, fluffy good-good to the table, spoon a generous cloud over everyone\u2019s dessert, and watch the crowd go wild. Crisis: averted.Now that you know how to make whipped cream, put some on top of this chocolate-Nutella sitch:Chocolate Nutella PuddingThe only acceptable reason to use the drool-face emoji.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titBasicallyWhipped CreamRecipes you want to make.
