Make the filling up to a day in advance, then enlist friends or family members to help you wrap. You can get as basic or as fancy as you\u2019d like with your pleats; for a step-by-step tutorial on the pleat instructions I describe in the recipe, check out this terrific guide on The Woks of Life\u00a0 under \u201c#4: The Bi-Directional Pleat.\" For maximum efficiency use a very large lidded nonstick skillet so you can cook up to 25 dumplings at once. The technique of steam-frying the dumplings in a combination of water and oil ensures the filling stays juicy while the bottoms get nice and crispy.If you don\u2019t plan on eating all the dumplings at once, freeze any leftover uncooked dumplings in a single layer on a rimmed baking sheet lined with parchment paper for a couple of hours. When the dumplings are frozen solid, transfer them to a resealable bag and store them in the freezer so you\u2019ll always have a 10-minute meal at the ready when you have no idea what\u2019s for dinner. \u2014Christina ChaeyAll products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Diamond Crystal or \u00bd tsp. Morton kosher salt\u00bdtsp. freshly ground white or black pepper50fresh or frozen thawed gyoza or other round dumpling wrappers2Tbsp. vegetable oil, dividedPreparationStep 1Stir black vinegar, \u00bc cup soy sauce, \u00bd tsp. sugar, and \u00bd tsp. gochugaru in a small bowl until sugar is dissolved; set dipping sauce aside.Step 2Drain kimchi in a strainer set over a medium bowl in the sink. Wearing gloves, squeeze all juice out of kimchi; reserve kimchi juice for another use (it\u2019s great in soups!). Chop kimchi and set aside (you should have about 1\u00bd cups).Step 3Using clean hands, mix pork, scallions, garlic, ginger, broth, sesame oil, oyster sauce, salt, white pepper, remaining 2 Tbsp. soy sauce, remaining 2 tsp. sugar, and remaining 1 tsp. gochugaru in a large bowl until well combined. Switch to a wooden spoon and mix, stirring in one direction, until a thin white film forms on the sides of bowl, about 4 minutes (this ensures the filling will hold together when spooned into wrappers and also doubles as your arm day workout.) (Alternatively, mix filling in a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment on low speed until a film forms on the sides of bowl.) Mix in reserved kimchi. Chill filling while you set up your dumpling wrapping station.Step 4Line 2 rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper. Set wrappers on a small plate and loosely cover with a damp paper towel to prevent them from drying out while you are folding dumpings. Place a small bowl of water near your work surface.Step 5You\u2019re ready to wrap! Lay a wrapper flat in the palm of your nondominant hand. Spoon a heaping teaspoonful of filling into center of wrapper. Dip a finger of your dominant hand into bowl with water and moisten the half of wrapper nearest to you. Bring moistened wrapper half together with dry half to form a semicircle and pinch middle to seal. Working from one corner toward the middle, create 1 or 2 pleats along one edge of dumpling; repeat working from the opposite corner. Place dumpling on a prepared baking sheet so the pleated side is facing up and the dumpling has a flat bottom (this is the side that\u2019s going to get maximum crisp!). Cover with a damp kitchen towel or a sheet of plastic wrap and repeat process with remaining wrappers and filling.Step 6Pour 1 Tbsp. vegetable oil into a cold large nonstick skillet with a lid and swirl to coat bottom of pan. Arrange half of dumplings, flat side down, in a single layer in skillet, then carefully pour in enough water to cover bottom third of dumplings (about \u00bd cup). Cover skillet, place over medium-high heat, and bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to medium and simmer dumplings until water is almost completely absorbed, about 5 minutes. Uncover and cook until skillet is dry and bottoms of dumplings are deep golden brown and crisp, about 3 minutes. Transfer dumplings to a platter. Swirl remaining 1 Tbsp. vegetable oil into skillet and repeat cooking process with remaining dumplings (or freeze the rest for a rainy-day snack).Step 7Serve dumplings hot with reserved dipping sauce alongside.Do Ahead: Filling can be made 1 day ahead; cover and chill. Dumplings can be formed 2 months ahead; freeze in a single layer on a baking sheet until solid, then transfer to a resealable plastic bag.
