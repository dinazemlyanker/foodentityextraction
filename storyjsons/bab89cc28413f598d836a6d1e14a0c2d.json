I prefer to use the Taiwanese rice wine michiu over other rice wines because it provides a clean yet complex aroma that complements the clams perfectly. \u2014Jessie YuChen, assistant food editorAll products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

We made it with clams and mussels and used gluten free fettuccine for our GF diner. I couldn't find black sesame oil or michiu so used regular toasted sesame oil and dry sake.
