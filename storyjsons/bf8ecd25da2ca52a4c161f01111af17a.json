Sushi has become such a highly sought-after commodity in Tokyo that both prices and wait times have ballooned to unreasonable levels. A $300 omakase dinner is already a stressful choice to make\u2014and that\u2019s not taking into account that reservation lists are often as long as a year or more. Nemuro Hanamaru does not require such extremes of its customers, and it also has something that haughty restaurants do not: fun. Just show up, get in line, and wait for your turn to start pulling as many plates as you can off the conveyor belt that circles the room. Watching your personal pile of empties stack up in front of you is a game unto itself.ORDER THE: items you definitely want by writing them on the provided order sheet and giving it to the waitress. But keep your eyes on the belt for specials you\u2019ve never tried before.THE VIBE IS: a blend of the everyman culture of the restaurant and the glitz of the Ginza district bustling six floors below. Service is boisterous and efficient while  the sleek decor and views of the city outside can make the affordability of the food hard to believe. But don\u2019t spend too much time staring out the window or the fish you really wanted might pass you by.PRACTICAL STUFF: Open daily from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. An English menu is available and the staff speaks some English. The nearest subway station is Sapporo.Photo by Xavier Girard Lacha\u00eeneNemuro Hanamaura has what\u2018s missing from so many other sushi restaurants: fun.\nPhoto by Xavier Girard Lacha\u00eeneAs you pull from the conveyor belt, you\u2018ll watch the plates pile up in front of you.\nBy Kee Byung-keunExplore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
