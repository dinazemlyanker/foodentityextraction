Admittedly, I wondered, Were these beautiful linens, in their blue, cream, and ivory hues, doomed to end up covered in stains and shut away in the back of a kitchen cabinet? After about 10 months of subjecting them to lipstick and red wine, tamari-glazed tofu, so much chili oil, and the saucy, greasy remnants of pepperoni slices from my go-to pizzeria, they\u2019re doing just fine. The magic of The Laundress\u2019s wash and stain bar keeps them looking good as new.This $7, 2.5-inch square of soap is the only spot treatment I buy because it\u2019s the only one I need. It works on everything from my cotton napkins to \u201cdry-clean only\u201d silk blouses, chunky knit sweaters, and synthetic blends. It also lasts forever. My messy household of two goes through two bars a year, with at least twice-weekly use.The Laundress Wash & Stain Bar$7 at The Laundress$6 at AmazonEager to learn more about what exactly makes this bar work so well, I called up Gwen Whiting, who cofounded The Laundress with business partner Lindsey Boyd in 2004. The two started the brand after studying fiber science at Cornell University. \u201cThe philosophy for The Laundress was not \u2018one size fits all.\u2019 It was very specialized\u2014a product specifically for woolens, one for silks and synthetics, one for whites, one for denim, and a stain treatment. And I wanted all the products we created to be really effective,\u201d Whiting says.What really sets it apart is how much thought was poured into its design. \u201cThe bar format is really tactile, and it allows you to have more control than you would with a liquid,\u201d Whiting says. It also means that, unlike with a liquid detergent, my stain bar ships in fully biodegradable packaging, with no single-use plastics in sight. \u201cWe were inspired by old-fashioned laundry bars, which are more common in South America or Europe. Those were traditionally made with animal fat, but we make our bar with plant-derived soap and borax, which is very old-fashioned but highly effective.\u201dMore effective, in my opinion, than any other stain remover because it works on every stain I\u2019ve subjected it to (many) and on every textile I own. While the Tide Pen enjoyed a moment on the big screen this summer In the Heights, the packaging specifically calls out that it doesn\u2019t work well on blood, grease, or ink stains. Bummer. Shout, another laundry aisle staple, advises against use on silk or wool fabrics and pointedly says that stains from ink or dyes can be impossible to remove. And yet, over the weekend, blue dye from a new pair of dark-wash denim shorts bled onto my favorite white tee, and I was able to easily wash it away with my Laundress bar. (Later that night I also treated the marinara sauce that dripped onto the other white tee I changed into. Did I mention my household was messy?)I have yet to meet a stain that these mighty little bars can\u2019t handle: food or makeup, fresh or a week-old and forgotten at the bottom of my hamper. The combination of soap and borax is hardly a new way to tackle laundry\u2014it\u2019s been used for hundreds of years, according to Whiting. But\u2014like my billowy white silk button-down which, thanks to The Laundress, is miraculously stain-free\u2014some things are classics for a reason.Explore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingHighly RecommendRecipes you want to make.
