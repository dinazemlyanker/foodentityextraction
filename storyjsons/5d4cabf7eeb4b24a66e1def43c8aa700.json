Compelled by my inner thriftiness, I would maneuver knives and long-handled spoons in a futile attempt to scrape out every last bit of mayo, confiture, or sauce. I would go as far as to throw a piece of fresh sourdough bread into a nearly empty Nutella jar, swishing it around with a chopstick to try and mop up every last bit. But much to my dismay, there would always be a corner of the jar beyond my reach. I\u2019d be forced to admit defeat and rinse out the last swipes of jam before repurposing the container as a pickling jar.But then a foot-long stick topped by a small half-circle-shaped spatula head came into my life. It\u2019s called a flessenlikker, which\u2014I am not making this up\u2014means \u201cbottle licker\u201d in Dutch. Invented in Norway in the 1900s, the flessenlikker took off in the Netherlands because of the popularity of custard, which was sold in tall bottles with tapered necks. The bottle licker allowed frugal Dutch housewives to wring every last drop from their custard bottles, and until this day it remains a quintessential tool in the Dutch kitchen. It\u2019s flexible enough to fit through narrow-necked bottles of oyster sauce and into the angled corners of hexagonal jam jars. The company that originally introduced the flessenlikker to the Netherlands has since expanded its business to designer bathrooms, and this bottle scraper reminds me of a tiny squeegee you would use to flick water off the glass walls of your shower or to defog your bathroom mirror after a home sauna session.Now not a smear of peanut butter, sesame oil paste, or doubanjiang goes to waste in my kitchen\u2014and I even use my bottle scraper to clean the sediment from the bottom of my wine glasses instead of trying to wedge my hand into the bowl. (It\u2019s a game changer for champagne flutes.) And I dare you to look through my recycling: Thanks to the flessenlikker, each and every bottle and jar is licked entirely clean.Bottle Scraper$11 at Amazon$18 at Walmart (Pack of 2)Explore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingHighly RecommendCultureRecipes you want to make.
