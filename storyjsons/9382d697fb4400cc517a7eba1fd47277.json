In \"There's No Better Time To...\" we'll share the little projects we're finally getting around to. This week: What to do when the pour is just a little too generous.As someone who lives and drinks alone (the latter quite regularly, especially these days during quarantine), I often pour myself a much larger glass of wine than I can finish. For years this glass would sit out overnight, half-empty, and glare at me in the morning, only to be poured back in its bottle (gross, I know). But now, to avoid this, I just fill an ice cube tray, freeze it, and then transfer my little wine cubes to plastic bags I keep in the freezer: one labeled RED WINE, another WHITE WINE.I learned this trick from Nigella Lawson, British cookery writer (and my culinary mother). While I learned to cook Korean food at the heels of my biological mom, this habit\u2014along with most of my other kitchen neuroses\u2014can be attributed to Nigella, whose television series I binged just as I was starting to live on my own. Slowly but surely, as I watched her stir risotto, roast chicken, and throw fabulous dinner parties for her friends, I learned how to cook\u2014and how to use my freezer as a pantry.My favorite part of each episode was when she\u2019d open her freezer to show us the stash of bits and bobs. I loved how packed and lived-in it looked, not unlike my own mother\u2019s freezer, every piece of leftover food saved for a rainy day: individual egg whites for pavlova; bacon slices packaged in pairs for easy thawing; stews frozen in single portions for instant dinner; and, my favorite, bags of frozen wine.No wine goes to waste.\nPhoto by Alex LauAs Nigella reasons in the episode entitled \u201cEntertaining,\u201d why waste leftover wine when you could freeze it? It\u2019s genius, really: At the end of her illustrious dinner parties, she takes any vino left over in the bottles (and sometimes, admittedly, at the bottom of people\u2019s glasses) and transfers it to small freezer bags (I\u2019ve found that freezing the wine into cubes first means they\u2019re pre-measured and easier to use).\u201cI know that wine snobs will say this is the most atrocious thing you can do,\u201d she says to the camera, \u201cbut I'm telling you, it works incredibly well indeed.\u201d Actually, a sommelier (a.k.a. certified wine snob) I used to date would probably endorse this behavior: He once told me that the quality of any vintage deteriorates anyway as it sits in its open bottle and oxidizes\u2014if you\u2019re not going to drink it right away, then you might as well freeze it for cooking.So while I won\u2019t defrost the wine to drink it again, over time, I will end up with enough cubes of frozen wine for all manner of cooking projects: when I\u2019m making a stew, for instance, and only need a glass (but don\u2019t want to open a whole bottle), or when I\u2019m searing a pork chop or a steak and fancy a splash of wine to deglaze the pan for a quick butter sauce (there\u2019s no need to thaw the cubes because they\u2019ll melt instantly against the heat). Theoretically, one could even freeze leftover ros\u00e9 for fros\u00e9\u2014and if that\u2019s not a party, then I don\u2019t know what is.Eric Kim writes about food, travel, and culture and lives in Manhattan with his dog.
