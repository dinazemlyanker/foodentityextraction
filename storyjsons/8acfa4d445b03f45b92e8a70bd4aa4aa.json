The solution: Make a tomato transportation device! Your heirlooms, cherries, and beefsteaks deserve it.The good news is that it\u2019s not that big of a deal, and the payoff of flawless, unblemished tomatoes is very much worth the extra step. It\u2019s simple: Next time you head to the market, bring along a large shallow food storage container or baking pan\u2014whatever best fits in your tote bag\u2014lined with a clean kitchen towel that is dedicated to tomato transport. Shop strategically by buying tomatoes last, nestle them securely in their special vessel, and stow said vessel at the top of your tote, carefully stacked on top of hardier produce items like ears of corn, heads of broccoli, and other heavy farmers market finds like jars of honey and pickles. If your tote is overflowing, you can always just carry the tray separately so that your tomatoes and other delicate things like stone fruit can be separated from the rest of your haul with padded protection.Whether you\u2019re sliding your bag into the backseat of your car or hauling it on the subway, you can rest easy knowing that your tomatoes will be safe on the ride home. Not only does this method keep your \u2019maters intact, but it also helps to keep your tote organized, making unpacking that much easier. Thanks to your tomato transportation device, next time you\u2019re assembling a tomato salad for a crowd, or taking a sunlit picture of your tomato toast for social media (no shame), you\u2019ll no longer waste precious time and tomato by having to carve out bruised or mushy spots.Speaking of tomato toast\u2026Tomato Toast with Chives and Sesame SeedsSprinkle the chives, sesame seeds, and flaky salt with abandon.View RecipeRecipes you want to make.
