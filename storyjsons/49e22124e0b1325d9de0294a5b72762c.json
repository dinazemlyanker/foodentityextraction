First, my parents live near the beaches. Second, maybe you heard already, but there is a budding food scene in Portland and the Kittery/Portsmouth area, with chefs who relocated from Boston and NYC to open relaxed spots with food on the same level as any major city. One thing I don\u2019t always love? Schlepping natural wine by the case from Brooklyn because I refuse to drink Canyon Road White Zinfandel at restaurants or the Whispering Angel at our local Hannaford!Lucky for me, that all changed after a recent trip, when I found the solution to my wine woes: Spruce Creek Provisions, an unassuming mercantile next to a Subway sandwich shop in the middle of a sprawling outlet mall in Kittery, Maine. My mother had recently been told by a friend that it has great Maine beers and a make-your-own-six-pack situation, something my father quickly got behind. However, I was still doubtful that I\u2019d find anything I liked and followed them in.No sweeter sight than this.\nPhoto by Pierce TwohigTo say I was pleasantly surprised would be an understatement. The wooden crate shelves are lined with all kinds of local hooch and many natural wines that are my go-to\u2019s in New York, like the tart and punchy Poderi Cellario \u00c9 Rosato and the minerally, floral Mariotti \u2018Smarazen\u2019 Bianco. I was like a (drunk) kid in a candy shop, quickly scanning for all my favorite bottles and stumbling upon some new ones like No Es Pituko, an organic and unfiltered Chilean chardonnay that smells like a foot but tastes like heaven. It\u2019s become the only white wine kicking around my Brooklyn apartment, ready to pop open for guests or bring to a friend\u2019s house.The price points here are another game changer. I find the bottles to be a few dollars cheaper than in NYC\u2014and when it comes to buying a case, those dollars add up! Now Spruce Creek Provisions is not only a mandatory stop on my way to my parents, but on my way back to the Big City too. Clearly, Spruce Creek Provisions has brought the light to southern Maine. And I\u2019m bringing a piece of it back to New York.Go there: Spruce Creek ProvisionsExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendWineMaineRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
