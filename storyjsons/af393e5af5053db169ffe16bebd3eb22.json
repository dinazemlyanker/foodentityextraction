Chop up the best hash browns.\u00a0By Sarah JampelOctober 21, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Laura MurrayFacebookTwitterEmailThis is Highly Recommend, a column dedicated to our very opinionated editors\u2019 favorite things to eat, drink, and buy.I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve noticed (I have), but Bon App\u00e9tit has a dearth of recipes for home fries. But every time I pitch it at a meeting, I\u2019m shot down. Limp! the crowds cry. Mushy! they say. Under-seasoned! Cold! A waste of valuable diner plate real estate!Clearly, none of those people have tried the home fries at Golden Diner in New York City. Chef Sam Yoo\u2019s version is exceedingly crispy (as in, you hear a crunch when you take a bite), with buttery-soft insides. The eating experience is like popping a potato chip and a spoonful of mashed potatoes into your mouth at the same time. The first time I tried them (on a breakfast plate with two fried eggs and very well-buttered toast), I couldn\u2019t figure out how they could inhabit two different realities at once. (My mom always told me that wasn\u2019t possible!)But the home fries at Golden Diner are so superior, as it turns out, because they\u2019re essentially chopped-up French fries. Or technically chopped-up hash browns\u2014which, in all honesty, are essentially flat, perfectly square French fries. (These get layered in the scallion milk bun breakfast sandwich\u2014a recommendation for another story.)It\u2019s not easy to achieve such perfection: The process is multi-day and painstaking. Once the Idaho potatoes are scrubbed and shredded, they\u2019re rinsed three times in cold water. Next, the strands are brined in a salt-vinegar solution to break down the potato for that luscious interior and infuse it with a slightly tangy flavor that, in Yoo\u2019s words, \u201chelps it taste more like a McDonald\u2019s hash brown.\u201d The drained potatoes are then steamed, immediately pressed into trays, weighed down with lots of heavy objects, and left to sit overnight. In the morning, the starches have bound the shreds into one homogenous cake, ready to be portioned into neat squares, deep-fried, and chopped up for the most perfect home fries. (If you think this kind of crunch can be achieved without deep-frying\u2026well, then you are mistaken.)Okay, so now that I know how much labor goes into these home fries, perhaps I\u2019ll stop pitching the recipe for Bon App\u00e9tit. We\u2019ll all just have to line up at Golden Diner instead.Go there: Golden DinerExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendNew York CityRestaurantsRead MorecultureThis Hotel Breakfast Turned Me Into a Morning PersonBy Aliza AbarbanelRecipes you want to make.
