Aside from its use as a soup base, it is a powerful flavor enhancer\u2014basically MSG on \u2019shrooms (MSG is the main ingredient, with dehydrated mushroom lagging behind).I\u2019ve been intrigued by mushroom powder ever since. As it turns out, there are plenty of kinds, from the glutamate bomb of powdered bouillon to good old unadulterated ground fungi. Mushroom powders come in clutch in the kitchen when the flavors of what I\u2019m cooking fall just a little short, and are especially useful in vegetarian dishes that don\u2019t feel complex enough. Here\u2019s what you need to know about the magical world of mushroom powder.Totole Granulated Mushroom Bouillon$12 at AmazonWhat is mushroom powder?In its purest form, mushroom powder is nothing more than mushrooms that are dehydrated and finely ground. The types of mushrooms that are used in the powder depend on the purveyor: Porcini and shiitake mushroom powders are probably the most readily available, but blends made of specialty mushrooms exist too. As Nikki DeGidio, kitchen manager of Seattle\u2019s Foraged & Found Edibles, explains, \u201cThere are so many mushroom powders out right now, especially with the booming medicinal market, that it can get a little confusing.\u201d So, let\u2019s break that down!Shiitake Mushroom Powder$25 at SpiceologyWe can group mushroom powders into two broad categories: culinary powders, which you\u2019ll find from spice sellers, and medicinal powders, which you\u2019ll see in the wellness aisle (that\u2019s different, of course, from, er, magical mushrooms). Often made with lion\u2019s mane and reishi mushrooms, the latter are branded with a focus on potential health benefits like cognitive support (some studies have suggested that mushrooms may have positive effects on brain health in humans if consumed frequently). The two aren\u2019t mutually exclusive though; as Michael Crowe, owner of Phoenix\u2019s Southwest Mushrooms, explains, many mushrooms are both flavorful and functional.What does it taste like?The flavor and smell vary depending on the mushroom, says Crowe. That might influence how you use them. Lion\u2019s mane powder, with its subtle cocoa scent, is mild enough to add to anything, he says, while maitake powder is darker in color and earthier in taste, and shiitake powder is even more pungent. A mix of mushrooms can add complexity: Foraged & Found Edibles\u2019s wild mushroom powder has a toasty, caramel, maple aroma that DeGidio attributes to its blend of foraged varieties, including chanterelle, porcini, lobster, morel, and hedgehog mushrooms.\u200bPay attention to what you\u2019re buying: Some wellness products, like drink mixes, aren\u2019t intended for cooking and often include other flavors.How do I use mushroom powder?DeGidio particularly loves using mushroom powder in homemade breakfast sausages, but also recommends whisking it into a warm vinaigrette for vegetables, as a seasoning on potatoes, and as a dry rub for meat. Steep mushroom powder for a broth that tastes flavorful fast, or add it to sauces, soups, beans, greens, and baked goods\u2014really, anything in which you want a little more oomph. To impart mushroom flavor into every bite of his potato gnocchi, chef Stefano Secchi makes his own porcini powder by blitzing dried mushrooms, then incorporates it directly into the dough along with all-purpose flour. And according to Crowe, some chefs have even used his mushroom powders as a gluten-free breading.\u201cThere are soooooo many applications for mushroom powder,\u201d DeGidio says. \u201cBut the key is: It needs to see heat to bloom, just like most spices. You won\u2019t get the depth of flavor and aroma if you simply try to sprinkle it on top of cooked food as a finish.\u201dIf it\u2019s potential health benefits that you\u2019re after, Crowe says that many people opt for two teaspoons of mushroom powder per day, mixed into a beverage like coffee or a smoothie, with lion\u2019s mane being the most neutral-flavored option.How do I store mushroom powder?Crowe sells his mushroom powder in resealable bags, which he recommends storing in the fridge to ensure potency. There, the powder will stay fresh and flavorful for a long time, though he recommends using it within one to two years of purchase. The freezer is a good option too, according to DeGidio.Are there any other kinds of mushroom powder?It does not, in fact, stop there! There are also many mushroom powder-based products that are more like spice blends, typically containing salt and other additives. Examples include Nom Nom Paleo\u2019s magic mushroom powder, Takii\u2019s umami powder, Trader Joe\u2019s multipurpose umami seasoning blend, and Imperial Taste\u2019s mushroom seasoning.Takii Umami Powder$9 at AmazonThese options will instantly add savoriness, but you might want to use them with a lighter hand. For every bit of umami they add, they\u2019ll also make things saltier, and since they often have other spices, these blends might not necessarily fit into the flavor profile you\u2019re going for. For this reason, DeGidio recommends always reading the label on mushroom powders so you really know what you\u2019re getting and what uses it\u2019s suited for.Real mushroom heads know the move here: Buy multiple kinds for multiple uses, of course.Vroom vroom mushroomsPorcini Gnocchi With Butter SauceThis mushroom gnocchi gets its savory flavor from dried porcini mushrooms, which are ground into powder and mixed into the dough.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titcookingShoppingRecipes you want to make.
