Now, with his vegan restaurant Pirate\u2019s Bone Burgers, he\u2019s one of the city\u2019s rising stars, and most outspoken advocates for justice for all.\u00a0By  Eric GinsburgNovember 21, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Barrett EmkeFacebookTwitterEmailZaid Renato Consuegra Sauza never dreamed of becoming a chef. Under other circumstances, he might be living in Boston instead of Kansas City. He might have finished school. He might be making movies for a living, as he\u2019d originally planned.\u201cIf I was documented,\u201d he says, \u201cI\u2019m 90 percent sure I would\u2019ve taken my life a different way.\u201dWith a tattoo wrapped around the back of his right hand and a colorful calavera and crossbones taking up most of the inside of his right forearm, Sauza certainly looks like a millennial chef. His scraggly beard and the colorful beanies he wears atop his closely cropped head seem right at home behind the counter of Pirate\u2019s Bone Burgers, the vegan restaurant he opened in Kansas City, Missouri, earlier this year. Here, in the high-traffic Crossroads neighborhood, Sauza slings juicy beet burgers and fries topped with melty cashew cheese. His deftly executed plant-based menu and determination to build a welcoming space set him apart. \u201cIt has definitely opened a lot of eyes as to whether or not people want more vegan food here,\u201d Kansas City food writer April Fleming says. \u201cI think it\u2019s clear by the response that people do.\u201dNamed one of the city\u2019s \u201crising stars\u201d last year, fitting in is new for Sauza. He wasn\u2019t quite 11 years old when he and his family immigrated from Mexico City to Shawnee, a porcelain-white suburb to Kansas City\u2019s southwest. \u201cWhen I got to Kansas, I realized how different it was than I had envisioned,\u201d he says. \u201cI thought everyone in America lived like The Nanny. That balloon popped real quick.\u201dAt school, his classmates often bullied him for being Mexican, and being short didn\u2019t help. And although he came to the U.S. legally on a tourist visa, he became undocumented just six months later, after overstaying the cutoff.\u201cI remember quite clearly when a classmate of mine called me an illegal alien,\u201d he says. \u201cAt the time I didn\u2019t know what that was. I knew it was bad. I knew that I was being picked on. But my only conclusion was that I looked weird\u2014that I looked like an alien.\u201dIn high school his family opened a movie rental shop, later expanding into a robust corner store with an array of products and its own kitchen. Working there consumed Sauza\u2019s social life. \u201cI remember birthdays and Christmas not being a thing,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s the same immigrant story you\u2019ll hear from other people\u2014always striving for more, but not necessarily being in the now.\u201dEager to escape Kansas, Sauza moved to Boston after high school and enrolled in a continuing education film and television program at Emerson College. It was all he could afford, and it didn\u2019t require him to provide a Social Security number. He thrived there, but when he tried to level up to a bachelor\u2019s degree, the school refused to admit him without proof of legal status. He threw himself at the mercy of a college administrator, literally begging her, down on his knees in her office, to help him. It didn\u2019t work.So instead, Sauza enrolled in a community college where the rules were more lax and graduated with an associate\u2019s degree. But then his status intervened again. He\u2019d gotten a driver\u2019s license\u2014his best form of legal ID\u2014back in Kansas, but state law had changed, and it was set to expire. There was nothing to be done but move back, where he took a job as a server at a Mexican restaurant, one of the few places that would hire him as an undocumented person.\u201cIt was one of those restaurants that just beats your life out of you,\u201d Sauza said. At one point while cleaning tables, Sauza told his manager that he had a college degree. \u201cIf you actually had a degree, you wouldn\u2019t be working here like any of these other wetbacks,\u201d the manager replied.The beet burger on a charcoal bun at Pirate\u2019s Bone Burgers.\nPhoto by Barrett EmkeSauza quit on the spot and soon returned to his mother\u2019s store. A new Walmart was threatening to force the small business into the ground, so in a desperate attempt to save it, Sauza offered to take over the kitchen. \u201cThat was the silliest thing I could do,\u201d he says. \u201cI had never been in a kitchen before.\u201d Yet he reveled in the chance to experiment and felt proud of what he was creating without any guidance: Fresh-baked focaccia and ciabatta. Meats he learned to butcher himself. New dishes pulled straight from his imagination, like drunken fish marinated in white wine and served with spicy Thai peppers.\nIn time he managed to attract a couple of regulars and confided in one that he secretly longed to open his own coffee shop. To his surprise, the customer offered him a loan.Sauza taught himself skills by watching YouTube videos. He found an espresso machine at a yard sale and perfected a method of pan-roasting his beans on the stove\u2014a time-consuming process but one that\u2019s more aromatic and offers intense flavor. And then, in January 2014, as he prepared to open his coffee shop in a tiny plaza in Kansas City\u2019s Brookside neighborhood, Sauza got another break: He was approved for DACA. The Obama administration had issued an executive order on immigration two years earlier, and Sauza was among more than 800,000 recipients, all of whom were brought to the U.S. as children.The program provided Sauza with deportation protection, making it possible for him to drive to work without fear for the first time. Soon after his approval, Sauza hung a pirate flag on the wall of his shop and opened for business. He called the place Pirate\u2019s Bone.Customers came slowly at first, but the shop began attracting citywide attention when Sauza put more experimental drinks\u2014like a chocolate latte with subtly spicy guajillo peppers\u2014on the menu. Then he expanded to food, and in 2017 switched to all vegan products, pulling from his Mexican roots to invent new dishes. There was a jackfruit pozole that used the dense, fibrous fruit to mimic the taste of pork. A pinto bean and cactus soup topped with greens, a dash of olive oil, and sesame seeds to round out the flavor. His vibrant beet-based veggie burger, served on an inky-black activated charcoal bun, became his local calling card. With it, Sauza started drawing press coverage and customers from around the city.Zaid, behind the counter.\nPhoto by Barrett EmkeAround the same time, the Trump administration was attempting to quash DACA despite the program\u2019s strong bipartisan support. More than 10 lawsuits were filed challenging the move, and court injunctions kept the program partially intact. Three cases went to the Supreme Court in early November, and rulings are expected to come in the spring of 2020. The results will determine the fate of nearly a million DACA recipients like Sauza who would become targets for deportation if the court rules against them.Though DACA provides deportation protection, the risks Sauza runs by being public about his status are real. Some immigration activists say ICE is targeting them, and it\u2019s unclear how the Supreme Court will rule. Sauza has already faced some conservative backlash online. It\u2019s hard for him to shake the fear ingrained from years of being undocumented. \u201cThe other day I was driving to work and I passed a yellow light that turned red quickly,\u201d he says. \u201cI had a cop right behind me and man, did I get chills. Once you live a certain way most of your life, it\u2019s really hard not to live that same way. Even with a license.\u201dBut that hasn\u2019t stopped him from becoming an activist. In the years since he opened his shop, Sauza has written an op-ed for a local newspaper, lobbied in Washington, D.C., shared his story on YouTube to inspire others, and joined national activist group United We Dream and a Kansas City\u2013based immigrant rights coalition called KSMODA that advocates for local undocumented immigrants. He also agreed to be a part of an amicus brief accompanying the cases at the Supreme Court. Sauza is one of 27 DACA recipients who shared their stories in the hopes that it will help sway the justices.\u201cNobody that hasn\u2019t been in these shoes can know how hard it is to live in the shadows,\u201d he says. \u201cI can\u2019t just cross my arms and hope somebody changes their minds. If I keep silent, nothing will get done.\u201dBut Sauza refuses to let fear rule him. Like becoming an entrepreneur, it\u2019s one of the things you learn to conquer out of necessity. \u201cI can\u2019t take minimum wage,\u201d he says. \u201cI will not be satisfied with the breadcrumbs that we get as immigrant people. We\u2019ve only been taught to settle, but we want to do better than settle.\u201dTo this end, Sauza decided to close his coffee shop and go bigger. This past September he and his business partner, Lydia Palma, opened a fast-casual restaurant, Pirate\u2019s Bone Burgers. With the tagline \u201cFeeding more plants to more people,\u201d the restaurant trades on its iconic black charcoal buns. It pulls from Sauza\u2019s success at the coffee shop, offering his beloved Dirty Horchata and the beet burger with guacamole, pickled cabbage, and greens. Sauza wanted to keep the menu simple in order to focus on quality, and most items follow the burger or sandwich approach, though he\u2019s also incorporated items like maduros (sweet plantains) and tostones (green plantain chips).A quiet day at the restaurant.\nPhoto by Barrett EmkeAlmost as soon as the restaurant opened, demand overwhelmed the small staff. Sauza and his team went through more food in a week than they\u2019d expected to need all month. It\u2019s exhausting yet thrilling, he says, to have a vegan, plant-based restaurant become so popular \u201cin the middle of meat and potatoes country.\u201d Just a few weeks in and still staffing up to meet demand, he\u2019s already thinking about how to expand to other cities.Yet the significance of Pirate\u2019s Bone Burgers extends well beyond the food. It\u2019s essential to Sauza that his restaurant is as inclusive as possible, an effort that takes a variety of forms. Pirate\u2019s Bone Burgers is one of the most ADA-accessible restaurants in Kansas City, and he\u2019s having the menu translated into Braille. To reach across class lines, the restaurant is accessible to public transit and nothing costs more than $5. Sauza will help offset operating costs by hosting occasional fancier pop-ups in the restaurant. Staff will go through various sensitivity and bystander trainings to build the most welcoming space possible.\u201cI think he\u2019s inspiring because he\u2019s built something lovely despite a lot of obstacles,\u201d April Fleming, the food writer, says. \u201cObstacles that would be really difficult for most people to overcome. I don\u2019t think he had a ton of support before he opened, meaning he wasn\u2019t one of the \u2018cool kids\u2019 in the industry here.\u201dSauza\u2019s activism and social conscience have made him \u201ca leading voice\u201d in the city,  especially on immigration, says acclaimed local chef Howard Hanna, who owns two Kansas City restaurants, including The Reiger next door to Pirate\u2019s Bone. \u201cThat\u2019s what we need, that kind of creative drive, and being a good employer and a good neighbor,\u201d he says. \u201cImmigration is a key issue for all of us in the food industry. When Trump\u2019s DACA repeal was announced and Zaid was vocal about that, for many of us, that was really important.\u201dFood may not be the future Sauza envisioned for himself, or the path he would\u2019ve chosen if our country\u2019s immigration laws were different. But as someone who\u2019s spent most of his life feeling marginalized, he\u2019s managed to turn food into an instrument of inclusion. Here at Pirate\u2019s Bone, he\u2019s carved out a space for not only himself, but anyone else who needs it.\u201cI guess it\u2019s because I\u2019ve always been the outsider,\u201d he says. \u201cI can totally understand what it feels like to not be wanted\u2014just for being different.\u201dExplore Bon App\u00e9titChefsRestaurantsKansas CityRecipes you want to make.
