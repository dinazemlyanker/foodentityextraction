Or maybe just that they could be beautiful. So she worked with the design team at Studio Robert McKinley to procure custom exit signs based on vintage ones (you know, when fonts were cooler). Then she got the new signs retrofitted to meet safety requirements\u2014for that warm, up-to-code glow. When I dined there last year, I thought they were the prettiest exit signs I\u2019d ever seen.Every detail at March has been so carefully considered that Rodil, a partner and master sommelier, laughs at herself when she tells me the lengths she went to find the perfect bathroom scent. But details matter! Especially when you\u2019re trying to craft the most elegant, memorable meal in town, one that transports diners to the Mediterranean, even if they can see the strip mall and CBD store on Westheimer Road out the window. (The unobscured view is intentional.) I was stunned by the food, the service, and the Champagne buckets. I wanted to steal the water glasses and run away with the porthole of pink vermouth. But I didn\u2019t! Instead, I asked Rodil to share their secrets.Photograph by Jody HortonThe TapestryThe showstopper is a woven tapestry by Buenos Aires artist Alexandra Kehayoglou that\u2019s meant to feel like a place where Mediterranean landscape meets the lush bounty of Texas agriculture (much of the restaurant\u2019s produce comes from a farm in nearby Bellville that\u2019s owned by March partners Bailey and Peter McCarthy). It covers the ceiling and extends down the far wall of the private dining room, encapsulating diners in green and coincidentally serving as a sound absorber. Go ahead, touch it!Photograph by Jody HortonThe Tables\u2014and Purse StoolsIndustrial designer Hayley Riccio, who\u2019s married to March chef and partner Felipe Riccio, devised dining room tables with tops that unscrew like giant lazy Susans. Shower cap\u2013style white tablecloths fit on them snugly to create a clean, modern look without any drapery. And whaddya know, Rodil\u2019s husband, Aaron, is an industrial designer too. He created the purse stools that give everyone a place to stash their phone\u2026and maybe even forget about it for a few hours.Photograph by Jody HortonThe Trippy TilesAppetizers are served on Portuguese Surrealejos tiles in the lounge. The trippy tiles\u2014some with a kaleidoscope of sardines, roosters, oranges, and eggplants\u2014start the meal with a wink. Don\u2019t take things too seriously here. Get the martini; it comes with a fried olive stuffed with duxelles\u2014when you bite into it, the color resembles a pit.Photograph by Jody HortonThe Champagne BucketsRodil chases hand-painted enamel French Champagne buckets at curio shops and sites like eBay and 1stDibs. \u201cWe\u2019re in a new building with new stuff all over,\u201d she says. \u201cWe want to strike a balance with something older, which has a sense of timelessness.\u201dPhotograph by Jody HortonThe Lonely Ma\u00eetre d\u2019A saturated painting by Oliver Jeffers shows a ma\u00eetre d\u2019 wearing an old-school tux and holding a candle, adrift at sea. A metaphor for the restaurant industry during the pandemic? If you want it to be. In the lonely, uncertain months before March opened, Riccio spent so much time standing in front of the painting, deep in thought, that the staff joke that it\u2019s \u201cFelipe\u2019s dad.\u201dPhotograph by Jody HortonThe Sweet Scent of\u2026the BathroomIs that a sun-kissed Seville orange I smell? Rodil chooses fragrances that change biannually with the menu to reflect a different region of the Mediterranean, so far often from Yucat\u00e1n-based perfumer Coqui Coqui. The Andalusian menu was matched with an orange scent, and the Maghreb menu called for spicy tobacco. In February, March is exploring Occitania, paired with Coqui Coqui\u2019s lavender and chamomile.Photograph by Jody HortonThe Dancing LadiesRodil hunts online for vintage Austrian Bimini glassware like these\u2014rare, delicate glasses with blown-glass figures of dancing ladies on the stems. The restaurant keeps track of which glasses it serves guests so that the next time you visit, you\u2019ll sip out of something different.Photograph by Jody HortonThe Exit SignsAren\u2019t they beautiful?
