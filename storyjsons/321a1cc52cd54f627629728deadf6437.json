Extremely niche. I think we wore name tags because everyone was too awkward to introduce themselves to near-strangers. One thing that brought everyone together this year, however, was Molly Baz\u2019s artichoke dip, made at the very last minute when we realized we needed more food for these food people. The dip, made from Molly\u2019s memory, was spinachy, cream cheesy, garlicky. Unstoppable. \u201cWhat is this RECIPE?\u201d we asked her, over and over. And it turned out to be something she started making in college, in a \u201cscummy house on campus,\u201d plucked from one of her seven roommate\u2019s bro bible cookbooks. \u201cIt was called the Bachelor Pad cookbook or something,\u201d she said.From the sound of that, you can tell Molly\u2019s college experience was culture-rich, fun, and exploratory. Some people search their whole life for the right spinach artichoke dip, but Molly found it right then and there, at a kegger in upstate New York, made by a kid named Pfeif.It turns out Pfeif\u2019s one and only cookbook was in fact called Two Dudes, One Pan, which, wow, uh, wow. Is the pan a metaphor? What else do they share? Toothbrushes?! But it doesn\u2019t matter, because Molly memorized the recipe and then adapted it to her liking. \u201cThere\u2019s a whole bachelor cookbook world out there,\u201d she informed me. \u201cWell, did it open your eyes to a new way of cooking?\u201d I asked. \u201cIt opened my eyes to nothing. If I saw this cookbook now, I\u2019d never open it. So I was lucky Pfeif made this dip that day.\u201d As are we!These are the components, in Mollyspeak: sweat a bunch of garlic in a shitton of butter, then add quartered canned artichoke hearts, sizzle those in butter, throw in a lot of fresh baby spinach and wilt that, a couple sticks of cream cheese, melt that into the pot, then add a lot of parm, black pep, salt. She adds to that more greens, garlic, pep, and then thins it all out with water. One woman, one pot.Unlike other artichoke dips, cough, ahem, mine, this doesn\u2019t go in the oven or require pimientos or nearly an entire tub of mayo. There\u2019s room in the world for both! Two women, two dips! I\u2019m not competing or anything. Molly\u2019s is all stovetop, probably healthier until she decided to serve it in a bread bowl, and I respect that. I ate half of the batch, and I\u2019m here to endorse it to the moon and back.Get the recipe:Stovetop Spinach-Artichoke DipServing this creamy, delicious dip in a bread bowl is not mandatory, but we highly recommended going for it.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titDipSpinachArtichokeRecipes you want to make.
