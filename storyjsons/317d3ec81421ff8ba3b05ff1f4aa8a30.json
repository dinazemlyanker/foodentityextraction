(You can also swap in any nut you want, it\u2019s versatile.)

Very easy and delicious. The one detail I missed was when to add the sea salt. I added it after it was cooled but not right before serving and ended up with ugly splotches of salt that melted into the chocolate. My fault, not the recipe. The salty bits still tasted great.\nThe ganache set up perfectly. I used 35% cream (maybe some out there are using 10% and having problems??) and 70% Lindt chocolate. Crust was a mix of pistachio/almond/walnut/pecan. Great!\nI will definitely keep this recipe for the future and am looking forward to visiting the restaurant, Elena, which, coincidentally, is just minutes from where I live. MikeMontreal, QC2/14/2022Impressive presentation and super simple to make! I followed it exact and it came out perfect. For the crust, I used a mixture of almonds, pistachio and walnuts. For the topping, I sprinkled salt flakes over the cooled ganache and a dollop of homemade whipped cream.  I used dark chocolate 72% dark chocolate chips about 1 TBSP less cream the recipe called for.  If using chocolate with a lower percentage of cocoa, I can see how the ganache would not solidify. Lysa PDENVER12/26/2021Absolute decadence!  I used half pistachios and half pecans for the crust.  Had no problem with it setting up, even after adding two tablespoons of bourbon to the ganache.  Have already made it twice.  So wonderfully good, and very simple.  This is a rockstar of a recipe.AnonymousEast Tennessee12/2/2021This will not set with the measurements given!\nNeeds half the amount of cream as listed.\nToo bad I ruined 40 tart shells with this recipe.\nTerrible recipe all the way around.BrenttHilton Head, SC8/21/2021I\u2019ve made this recipe multiple times and it always turns out bomb. I\u2019d recommend using a chocolate that\u2019s at minimum 70% for the ganache to set properly(Guittard and Scharffenberger baking bars are both solid options for this), as well as mostly using nuts that impart a lot of flavor(hazelnuts, pistachios, and almonds are my fave combo) This is a minimalist recipe so using the best ingredients you can find will make a noticeable difference. On another note, I\u2019m down to try making a dairy free version of this using coconut, but I\u2019m unsure as to wether canned coconut milk or coconut cream would make a better sub for the heavy cream. Any advice would be much appreciated! Cheers!RaeAlbany, NY7/1/2021I made this sugar free and it was excellent. It could be done with coconut milk for a vegan version.  I would make it again many times. I did reduce the cream with 1/2 cup as suggested by other commenters. Also added some sweetener in the ganache. The crust was too dark at 19 min so try 15 min first. I tried freezing it. The crust became soft. But still tastes great.  Anonymous3/6/2021Impressive presentation and super simple to make!  I brought this to work for a birthday celebration and the tart raving reviews. Even those at work who had started their new year diets made an exception to take one bite because the tart looked so tempting. \n\nFor the crust, I used finely ground Biscoff biscuits and a mixture of hazelnuts and walnuts.  The color and texture companion Ed the smooth chocolate ganache well.\n\nFor the topping, I sprinkled salt flakes over the cooled ganache, drizzled homemade salted caramel and then added pomegranate seeds. \n\nConcerned about the comments about the ganache not solidifying enough, I decided to use coarsely cut high quality dark chocolate with a mixture of 72% dark chocolate chips by Guittard and also used about 1/4 cup less of the heavy cream the recipe called for.  I was certain to mix the chocolate and the cream  very thoroughly.  Dark chocolate seems to absorb or require more liquids to ensure the ganache is smooth consistency for pouring yet doesn\u2019t dry too hard. Hence, the greater percentage of cocoa, the greater amount of liquid ito achieve the right consistency. If using chocolate with a lower percentage of cocoa, I can see how the ganache would not solidify enough to achieve consistency suitable for being cut with a knife.  \n\n\n\nAnonymousAustin, Texas1/7/2021The reviews noting that the ganache never set had me worried - so I ended up using 1 1/2 cups of heavy cream and 4 Tbsp of butter instead. I had no problems with it setting and will definitely try what the recipes calls for next time. You really need to stir the ganache for a while (silky and glossy is key!) to ensure a proper mixture. I also used a 9in springform pie pan, as it was all I had on-hand.\n\nIt was a big hit! And the sea salt sprinkled on top was *chef's kiss*. It's quite rich, so I'd advise cutting it into smaller portions than this recipes calls for.AnonymousMinneapolis, MN12/28/2020This is so great. I had total success even tho I ran low on heavy cream and had to sub a tiny bit of whole milk. I used high quality chocolate and did just as the recipe said. My crust was 75% almond and 25% walnut. I topped it with pistachio shavings and pomegranate seeds for some seasonal flair. \n\nThe people who didn\u2019t like the recipe were likely victims of operator error. I will try this is all sorts of variations... candied orange peel for topping next!AliciaKansas City, MO12/26/2020The crust is excellent but the proportions for the ganache are way off. - too much cream to chocolate. As I poured the liquid filling into the crust I felt sure it would never firm up. I was correct, it remained so loose that the only way I could serve it was as a frozen dessert. The flavor was delicious but I would never make the recipe again as it\u2019s written.AnonymousCharleston 12/18/2020I made this yesterday. It was easy and turned out great. I used half pistachios and half almonds. I was worried the ganache was too loose, but it set up fine. I had quite a bit left over though. Maybe my pan is a little on the small side. Aunt LouCanada11/15/2020Absolutely delicious! I would totally recommend :DfoodorFrance6/16/2020Very nice! It\u2019s so rich, I say it serves twice as many as written. I increased the chopped chocolate amount by ~15% and the ganache turned out just fine. Ohioan6/15/2020I have made this recipe 4 times now, and it consistently comes out great.  I follow the instructions as outlined here, and it creates a decadent dessert that people really love.  Not sure why people are having trouble with the ganache; I make it per the recipe and it comes out perfectly every time.RolltideNorth Carolina6/13/2020I had the same problem as Anonymous\u2014the recipe calls for too much cream.  The chocolate  mixture was runny.  The recipe calls for you to \u201cscrape the ganache into crust\u201d, but mine was so runny that it was just a pour, not a scrape.  I tried to save it by adding more chocolate and refrigerating it overnight, but it is still the consistency of a runny pudding. It tastes fine, if a bit grainy, but not a good recipe to serve to guests. The crust is great, however.
