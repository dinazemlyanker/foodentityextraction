Add onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened but not browned, 6\u20138 minutes. Add garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened and fragrant, about 5 minutes. Stir in red pepper flakes.Step 2Add tomatoes, crushing with your hands as you go; increase heat to medium-high. Bring to a simmer and cook, stirring often, until tomato liquid is reduced by half and tomatoes take on a jammy consistency, 12\u201315 minutes. Add clams and 2 cups water. Cover pot and cook, stirring occasionally and reducing heat as needed to maintain a simmer, until clams begin to open, 8\u201310 minutes. Uncover pot and transfer opened clams with a slotted spoon to a plate. Re-cover pot and continue cooking clams until they open, up to 15 minutes longer; discard any clams that haven\u2019t opened by this time.Step 3Add ditalini to pot and cook, stirring often (pasta will want to settle and stick to the bottom of the pot), until al dente, 8\u201310 minutes. Add clams back to pot.Step 4Ladle clams and sauce among bowls; top with basil. Serve with bread alongside for dipping.How would you rate Clams Arrabbiata?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (7)Back to TopTriangleEasy and delicious.  I\u2019ve accidentally left the eye on after we served the meal.  We ended up preferring the excess that had cooked 10 minutes longer.  It\u2019s a great recipe and I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll make it again.  Personally, I prefer clams in a white sauce, but my husband thought this was the best ever.  The fresh basil garnish is an absolute must.AnonymousChattanooga TN7/19/2021I have come back to this time and time again - just so delicious. SamanthaSan Francisco3/1/2021Amazingly simply dish with lots of great flavor! Lisa M. Providence, RI2/2/2021Made this last night for our NYE dinner and it was delicious! I was worried that it wouldn\u2019t be salty enough since there\u2019s no salt but the bacon (sub for pancetta) flavored it perfectly. I could have licked my bowl clean and saved myself the dish washing. That\u2019s how good it was!VannyCalifornia1/1/2021F me, this was so good. This was so easy and tasted amazing! Thanks Chris!!AnonymousVancouver5/11/2020This was one of the most memorable meals I've made in a while. Seriously, so delicious. Serve with a red wine and Dean Martin for the ultimate red sauce vibes. Can't wait to make it again!alizaraeNew York4/23/2020Thank you, Chris Morocco! This is unquestionably the most delicious seafood pasta dish I\u2019ve ever cooked and among the very best I\u2019ve ever eaten. I didn\u2019t have pancetta, so we used bacon, but I\u2019m sure it didn\u2019t hurt that the clams were dug on Sunday morning. nschmiBoothbay Harbor, ME4/15/2020Explore Bon App\u00e9titStewSoups and StewsItalianEuropeanClamShellfishSeafoodPancettaCured MeatMeatCanned TomatoTomatoVegetableOne-Pot MealsMainDairy-FreeNut-FreeHealthyishSimmerDinnerRecipes you want to make.
