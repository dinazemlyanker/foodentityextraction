Murray's is a dairy mecca, no question.ORDER: cheese you can't find anywhere else. Murray's cheesemongers know their stuff and you should ask them questions, even if you don't know your Moses Sleeper from your Brie de Meaux. They'll help guide your choices and give you samples to try.THE VIBE IS: a gleaming, pristine shop that stacks shelves high with lots of specialty food items beyond cheese. Pick up some fancy pasta or local beers while you're there\u2014or get a grilled cheese for lunch. This is exactly the kind of place to send your out-of-town friends who want to purchase a NYC food souvenir. For New Yorkers, there are classes several nights a week on cheese 101, mozzarella making, cheese and beer pairing, and lots more (You just might see a BonApp editor teaching one of them!).PRACTICAL STUFF: The West Village flagship store is open daily from 8 a.m. to 9 p.m. except on Sundays, when it opens at 9 a.m. and closes at 8 p.m. There's also a stand at Grand Central Market, and you can find Murray's-curated cheese at Kroger grocery stores across the country. Book classes here\u2014they're fun.\u2014Carey PolisWE ALSO LOVESOS ChefsWhere serious cooks stock up in the East VillageBuvetteTr\u00e8s West Village, with hints of ParisDon AngieCheeky Italian-American in the West VillageExplore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
