In France, instead of the Tooth Fairy, there\u2019s a tiny mouse that sneaks into children\u2019s rooms and steals their teeth. In certain provinces, the traditional greeting of \u201cla bise\u201d is not limited to two cheek kisses but extends to three or sometimes four. The French word for \u201cwalkie talkie\u201d is, absurdly, \u201ctalkie walkie.\u201d But the most valuable thing I learned is that, after a meal of ripe cheese or garlicky snails, a normal breath mint won\u2019t cut it. You need Cachou Lajaunie.Cachou Lajaunie are black, square pastilles about the size of a stud earring that pack an enormous menthol-y, licorice-y wallop. Developed in 1880 by Toulouse pharmacist L\u00e9on Lajaunie, they were marketed as a solution for bad breath for \u201csmokers, chauffeurs, cyclists, etc.,\u201d which leaves me with some unanswered questions about 19th-century French cyclists. The distinctive yellow, circular tin was designed by a watchmaker to fit in a gentleman\u2019s waistcoat pocket, and it looks the same today as it did nearly a century and a half ago. To dispense a pastille\u2014and you only need one\u2014you twist the tin like an old-school decoder ring and shake one out through the revealed opening.The addition of natural mint flavor and powdered catechu, an acacia tree extract used in ayurvedic medicine and known for its refreshingly astringent quality, gives the petite pastilles a cooling mouthfeel, but the dominant flavor is definitely licorice. In the U.S. we tend to think of \u201cmint\u201d as synonymous with fresh breath, but not so in other parts of the world. (See: mukhwas, the anise and coriander seed Indian palate cleanser, and Euthymol, the polarizing, cotton-candy-pink toothpaste from the U.K. that contains thyme.) But I can vouch, the feeling after is clean, clean, clean.Now I keep a tin of Cachou Lajaunie in my purse at all times. Not only are its breath-freshening properties more effective than a TicTac, but they\u2019re also more delicious\u2014at least to a licorice lover like me. While I can\u2019t get behind all things fran\u00e7ais (talkie walkie!), Cachou Lajaunie gives me the breath confidence I need for endless cheek kissing.Buy it: Cachou Lajaunie, $23 for six tins on AmazonAll products featured on bonappetit.com are independently selected by our editors.
