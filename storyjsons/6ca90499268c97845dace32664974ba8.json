Obscure patterns! I did the late night scrolling so you don\u2019t have to.By Alex BeggsMarch 7, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Chelsie CraigFacebookTwitterEmailSure, you could track down estate sales in your area and hit up the garage sale circuit every weekend. That\u2019s one way to collect vintage Pyrex. But then there\u2019s the internet. Global! At your fingertips! Seems faster after midnight! Whether you\u2019re trying to complete a set of Autumn Harvest Wheat mixing bowls passed down from your great aunt or you\u2019re hunting for something funky and rare, I scoured Etsy for the best shops selling vintage Pyrex. (Admittedly it\u2019s not as much fun\u2014or cheap\u2014as when I ran into a mom in a Michigan antique barn training her daughter to look out for specific patterns, but I discovered a few European designs that I\u2019d never run into stateside thanks to the global reach of Etsy. Cool!) If anyone spots a Willow in the wild, let me know. Happy shopping!The Best: PyrexPotpourriOne of the most charming things about Etsy is when you remember this is a user-run online flea market and not a shiny corporate retailer. So when the photos are bad, you forgive. The photos on PyrexPotpourri are dark and at odd angles, all taken on someone\u2019s Denton, Texas, dining room table. But this collection is vast. There are sets of Colonial Mist mixing bowls, yes, but also my favorite: refrigerator boxes with glass tops (I use them for cat treats and household miscellany). There are Pyrex coffee mugs, classic casseroles, and retro divided baking dishes I wouldn\u2019t know what to do with\u2014but now I kind of want. OMG Forest Fancies. Each listing has tons of photos, tons of helpful information about the pattern, the production year and locale, and wear markings. I appreciate the honesty. A small con: the shop mixes other brands in with the Pyrex, which can be confusing.The Reliable: OverTheYearsFindsWhile this collection is smaller, around 60-70 pieces, there\u2019s a good variety and quality merch. No blurry business here. Everything is photographed straight-on, which feels like you\u2019re having a confrontation with a casserole. Intense! I want this set of cheery Flirtation mugs. And this carafe!The Solid Standby: SnowyCreekDesignsA condensed collection of Americana Pyrex patterns in complete sets, like Gooseberry, Butterprint Amish, and Spring Blossom. This Rhode Island shop also sells a lot of vintage linens, which pop up in the Pyrex listings. Subtle! This is also where you\u2019ll find basic solid primary color sets\u2014not exactly the stuff people get tattooed on their bodies, but it\u2019ll never go out of style. Also: DOTSSSS!Do you need an entire Amish Butterprint Cinderella mixing bowl set? I say yes.\nPhoto by Chelsie CraigThe Prolific: PyrexKitchenThis Massachusetts-based store has even worse photos, some are hilariously blurry, and all were apparently taken during the dead of night. However, that\u2019s when I shop on Etsy so I\u2019m okay with it. There are hundreds of errant mixing bowls and casseroles here if you\u2019re replacing a one-off. It\u2019s the junk store you need to hunt to find treasure in. I love orange spots! You know what would make a great wedding present? This sunflower set.The Prolific, Part II: VioletsEmporiumStoreIf PyrexKitchen takes their photos at midnight, Violets Emporium is using a budget boudoir backsplash for their Pyrex listings. I\u2019m seeing red! The overwhelming, unorganized collection, based in the U.K., includes some cool British Pyrex designs like Briarwood (love!), and includes the lids in a lot of listings, which is rarer than it seems. A browser\u2019s paradise. Ooo peaches!The Avid Collector: GoodVibesVintageShopAnother passionate Pyrex seller with nearly 100 pieces. Daisy lids make me smile.The Obscure: OnmykitchentableYou know it\u2019s a good shop when they\u2019ve organized their inventory to have an entire tab dedicated to vintage Pyrex. This French store takes photos in clear, natural light, albeit at odd angles and with a bunny figurine for scale. There are some obscure patterns (the lobster!!) including a lot of European designs you don\u2019t run into in the U.S. very often (Tulipa!). The downside, obviously, is the cost of shipping internationally, and many dishes don\u2019t come with their corresponding lids.The Real Fan: PyrexPartyPixieIn no particular order, I know that PyrexPartyPixie likes three things: Vintage Pyrex, macarons, and bread. They appear in her well-lit listings for casserole dishes\u2014with the occasional quail egg (on theme with the impressive complete set of Fowl Play pattern!)\u2014keeping things interesting. It\u2019s an eclectic collection, mostly casseroles, (another lobster!) with the occasional party-ready warming stand. Ships from the U.K.For Mugs: VintageDecorAddictThis collector has a handful of nice teacup sets, like Spice of Life. And a one-off of the milk glass Honeydew Summer Impressions. You think I\u2019m making the pattern names up at this point, but I\u2019m not.The Far Flung: ThatRetroPieceWe\u2019re in Australia, where Pyrex was produced by other companies, resulting in some trippy and beautiful patterns unlike what we grew up with, like Black Rose. Fun to peruse! The pastel background color blocks feel like the set of children\u2019s show\u2014playful! In my late night Etsy shopping cart: This poppy cake dish.The Scandi: RosieFleurThis Amsterdam-based shop typically has around 50-60 Pyrex listings (mostly European designs) at a time, all photographed beautifully. Instead of a glass here, a plate there, Rosie Fleur collects sets, so scrolling feels like shopping in a well-curated boutique. Plus there are tons of funky patterns I\u2019d never seen before, like Arcopal Lotus, not technically Americana Pyrex but similar in material/sturdiness and fun. Love these blocky florals.
