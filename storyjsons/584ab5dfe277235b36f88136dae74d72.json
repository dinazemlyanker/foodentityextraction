The vision: Drive around the U.S. with my boyfriend, chowin\u2019 down on jerky with my feet on the dash. \u201cJust the Slim Jims,\u201d I imagined myself saying to every gas station attendant, ushering an armful of meat twigs across the counter. I mean, what\u2019s not to love? They\u2019re sweet-salty, chewy, filling, and arguably better for me than my other road trip kryptonite: Pringles. But then one night my boyfriend sent me an Instagram reel of a fluffy calf trotting happily about a farm, which triggered an hours-long baby cow video spiral, and a hysterical declaration that \u201cYou can\u2019t love something *and* want to eat it!!!\u201d So now I\u2019m all stocked up on mushroom jerky instead.So, how does mushroom jerky compare to the meat stuff?First, allow me to state the obvious: mushroom jerky tastes like mushrooms\u2014not beef. So if you don\u2019t like fungi\u2019s earthy flavors, this probably isn\u2019t the product for you. But! If, like me, you\u2019re trying to eat less meat and you\u2019re down with \u2019shrooms, mushroom jerky is a great alternative. It\u2019s immensely satisfying\u2014fleshy, umami-packed, and filling\u2014and fibrous mushrooms seem to soak up flavors and seasonings like nature\u2019s little sponges. As chef, writer, and Emmy Award\u2013nominated TV host Sophia Roe says, mushroom jerky \u201cmakes you think, \u2018Wow, this is definitely made of meat,\u2019\u201d without, well, being made of meat.Another perk of going full fungi: not only is mushroom jerky delicious and seriously nutritious, but I also feel better knowing it\u2019s gentler on the earth than beef. And mushrooms are a sustainable alternative to more than just fake meat. Thanks to their unique structure and chemical properties, they provide the ideal building blocks for everything from housing insulation to faux leather.I\u2019m sold. Can I make it myself?Yes! However, I am but a mere mushroom stan, so I asked Roe for advice. Here\u2019s how she makes mushroom jerky:Toss 8 oz. mushrooms (Roe usually goes for shiitakes, but choose your faves. Know this: Your jerky will only be as good as the mushrooms you buy, so opt for something \u201cmeaty\u201d and flavorful) and coat them in about \u00bc cup coconut aminos, 2 tsp. apple cider vinegar, 1 tsp. paprika, a splash of liquid smoke (optional), and a few cracks black pepper. (For extra flavor oomph, store marinated mushrooms in a resealable bag and refrigerate overnight before dehydrating.)Preheat your oven to its lowest temperature (usually around 250\u2109). Line a sheet pan with a Silpat, spread out your mushrooms, and bake for an hour.If your mushrooms are large or still wet-looking, flip them with tongs and bake for another 30\u201345 minutes. The finished product should look wrinkly and shrunken, like dried fruit. Let cool and store in an airtight container.I\u2019m not that guy. Can I buy mushroom jerky instead?Great news: There are plenty of store-bought jerkies that are just as delicious as the homemade stuff AND easier to acquire for lazy people and people on road trips (me and me!). The ones below are some of the best I\u2019ve sampled, but the world is really your oyster (mushroom).Moku Hawaiian Teriyaki Mushroom JerkyWith a moderately sticky texture and a sweet-salty flavor, thanks to pineapple juice and coconut aminos, Moku\u2019s king oyster mushroom jerky is the ideal gateway to fungi fandom.$21 at Amazon (3-Pack)VEGKY Pepper Shiitake Mushroom JerkyIf you love Chinese Five Spice, you\u2019re going to love this shiitake jerky, which, textually, seemed most similar to the beef stuff.$8 at AmazonPan\u2019s Applewood BBQ Mushroom JerkyIf you\u2019re having a hard time getting your hands on this smoky-chewy shiitake jerky, that\u2019s because it\u2019s flying off the virtual shelves.

What can I do besides eat it right out of the bag?Here\u2019s what I\u2019ve realized on my road trip thus far: Because it\u2019s already \u201ccooked\u201d and seasoned, mushroom jerky is a superfast route to flavorful and substantial meals and snacks. I\u2019ve tossed many a packet in salads for some textural heft. I\u2019ve stir-fried those little hunks with broccoli and rice as a shortcut to various Airbnb dinners. I\u2019ve snuck a few slices into sandwiches for a little fleshy kick. And I\u2019ve sliced them into a sort of savory trail mix with nuts and seeds. But don\u2019t let me limit your magical mushroom jerky journey. Go wild! Try it all! And know that Mother Earth and her sweet baby moo-moos will be grateful you did.Explore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
