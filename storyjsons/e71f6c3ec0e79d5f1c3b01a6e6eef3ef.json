Meatloaf. Sandwich.You might even have all the ingredients in your pantry right now.By Chris MoroccoMay 11, 2020FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Chelsie Craig, food styling by Pearl JonesFacebookTwitterEmailMeatloaf has never quite risen above its name. It offers comfort and predictability, but rarely fireworks. I mean, think about it: All you do is slap together some eggs and breadcrumbs, pantry stalwarts like ketchup and Worcestershire sauce, some ground meat (meatloaf doesn\u2019t care which kind), and bake it until it falls somewhere between not-raw and not-burnt. No matter what, chances are, it will be pretty good.But isn\u2019t it time for something better? Couldn\u2019t meatloaf be GREAT?Cooking at home has made my pantry work harder than ever, and I\u2019m constantly turning to ingredients that I know will add maximum taste-bud payoff with minimal fuss. Gochugaru, soy sauce, sesame oil, scallions, garlic, and ginger are all in constant rotation right now for exactly that reason. Which then made me ask myself: Aren\u2019t these make up the mouth-wateringly delicious flavors of Bulgogi, the Korean dish of sliced and marinated meat, grilled over fire or seared in a pan? Couldn\u2019t applying those same flavors save meatloaf from its middling reputation?So that\u2019s just what we did: We combined all the ingredients pulled straight from a simple marinade, plus the usual ground meat, eggs, and panko, and made a Bulgogi meatloaf. And it was... good. Like, really good. Like eat-it-cold-from-the-fridge really good.But what made it next-level was taking the thought one step further, and searing a gloriously thick slice of that already-awesome meatloaf and sliding it between two squares of pullman bread slathered with a few swipes of gochujang and a pile of kimchi. It\u2019s spicy and sweet, crispy and juicy, crunchy and tender, faithful and fresh\u2014all at the same time.There you have it: A meatloaf that shakes off its humble roots. And we think it\u2019s pretty great.Get the recipe:Bulgogi Meatloaf SandwichA flavor-packed spicy, sweet, and sour sandwich that takes the idea of meatloaf all the way to the edge.View RecipeRecipes you want to make.
