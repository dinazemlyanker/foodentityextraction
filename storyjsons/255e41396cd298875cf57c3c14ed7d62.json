Fear not. Our friends at NYC and LA natural beauty and wellness mecca, CAP Beauty, have the spring skincare routine to get that glow back, fast. Founders Kerrilynn Pamer and Cindy DiPrima Morisse co-authored their new book, High Vibrational Beauty, with seasonality in mind. Wondering what the spring-worthy makeup shades are? Pamer and DiPrima Morisse prefer yellows, greens and blush tones. Craving a breakfast gazpacho? CAP\u2019s recipe includes beauty-meets-wellness ingredients like apple cider vinegar and avocado. We asked them how to help our skin transition naturally from winter to spring with an eye toward summer, and here's their best advice.Beauty is an inside-out and outside-in job.Both DiPrima Morisse and Pamer are advocates of upping their antioxidant intake with ingredients from the pantry that can be mixed in the kitchen to eat, drink, and apply (more on that later). \u201cAs the weather warms, I up my intake of fruit and raw juices and add sea buckthorn puree to my morning glass of water,\u201d  says DiPrima Morisse. \u201cThe boost in antioxidants also helps my skin\u2019s natural defense against sun damage. I\u2019m a sun seeker so that\u2019s super important!\u201d Besides applying a non-nano zinc sunblock (like Raw Elements Tinted Facial Moisturizer +30 SPF, $18) before exposure, Pamer reminds us that a sunburn is inflammation of the skin. \u201cEating fruits and vegetables in all colors builds up your body for sun exposure,\u201d she says. \u201cStaying away from inflammatory foods can be beneficial as well.\u201dCleanse early.Get your routine done as soon as you get home for the day. \u201cIt\u2019s such a great habit to get into as it allows you to separate your day from your evening, and your cleanse is done by the time you\u2019re heading to bed,\u201d says Pamer. \u201cBut sometimes life gets in the way and it doesn\u2019t happen right when I get home.\u201d The routine-altering tip came from a CAP esthetician who swears by the face-first system for busy clients. \u201cI started doing it after my son was born because I found myself getting so tired that my skincare routine fell by the wayside,\u201d says DiPrima Morisse. \u201cPlus, my evening products tend to be more potent, so this gives them a longer window to work.\u201d She recommends Mun Akwi Purifying Cleanser ($60), Marie Veronique Gentle Gel Cleanser ($35) and African Botanics Baobab Clay Oxygenating Cleanser ($60).Massage well.Winter is tough on the skin. \u201cThe freezing weather outside and excessive heat inside leave complexions parched and in need of serious exfoliation,\u201d says DiPrima Morisse. Facials offer up a relaxing and efficient way to shed the layers and nourish the skin. \u201cOur estheticians use massage to prep for exfoliation, to boost circulation, and to lift and plump the skin,\u201d and you can try it at home, too. Start at the base of the neck and, using alternating hands, make quick strokes upward and outward while cleansing. Feel free to massage your way through your entire routine. Don\u2019t forget the eye area!Layer like you mean it.\u201cI always start with Kristina Holey + Marie Veronique\u2019s Barrier Restore Serum ($110) then turn to a revolving cast of serums, oils and creams,\u201d says DiPrima Morisse. Load up on treatment-focused serums like Leahlani Champagne Serum ($38), One Love Organics Morning Glory Caffeinated Firming Serum ($59) or In Fiore Complexe de Fleur ($160). \u201cI like to go for dewy, so I really can\u2019t overdo it!\u201d says DiPrima Morisse. Make the most out of your evening application of nutrient-rich products by preserving the protective barrier that your skin builds overnight into morning. \u201cI love what happens to my skin overnight. I like to keep those naturally occurring oils on my face by just doing a quick rinse of water, a spray of toner or hydrosol, and a quick hit of hydration through a hit of oil or moisturizer,\u201d says Pamer. Tone with Hannes Dottir Mineral Mist ($45), Marie Veronique Pre + Probiotic Daily Mist ($40) or Living Libations Rose Glow Complexion Mist ($30). Hydrate with Tata Harper Repairative Moisturizer ($105) or May Lindstrom The Blue Cocoon ($180). \u201cYou feel and look different when you use products that rely on the bounty of nature,\u201d says DiPrima Morisse. \u201cIt\u2019s the same concept as eating. We\u2019re just feeding our skin instead of our tummies.\u201dMake time for a mask.CAP\u2019s Replenishing Mask recipe touts a clean-enough-to-eat list of superfoods that can be to be whisked together in the kitchen. \u201cMasks are important any time of the year, especially spring, as your skin has just come out of winter and might feel a little dull and be hungry for deep nutrition,\u201d says DiPrima Morisse. In this recipe, the matcha boosts circulation, tocos delivers high levels of vitamins D and E, chlorella detoxifies the skin, and manuka honey works as a soothing, antibacterial exfoliator. Wear it for 20 or 30 minutes while going about your day. \u201cI tend to read or play with the kids,\u201d says DiPrima Morisse. \u201cMy kids are pretty used to me looking like a sea monster. At this point they think its normal!\u201dCAP Beauty\u2019s Replenishing Mask RecipePerform: Once a week, two times a week is great.What You\u2019ll Need: Matcha, water, tocotrienols, manuka honey, chlorella, a small ceramic brush and bowl.Duration: 20 to 30 minutes.How To Do It: Whisk or stir 1\u20442 teaspoon matcha into 1 tablespoon water and set aside. Add to a small ceramic bowl 1\u20442 tablespoon tocotrienols, 1 tablespoon honey and 1 teaspoon chlorella and mix well with the brush. Slowly and deliberately pour the brewed matcha, as needed, until it reaches a paste like consistency. Be careful not to create too thin a consistency. If needed, add more tocotrienols and honey.Apply to your clean face with the brush. Allow to sit for 20 minutes. We like to take a bath or meditate while we\u2019re masking. It may be drippy, so lying down is smart. Enjoy a timeout.Remove with warm or cool water, scrubbing gently to promote a light exfoliation. Your skin will feel dewy, cleansed and revived.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishRead MoreLifestyle5 Foods That Belong On Your Skin and HairBy Katie ChangRecipes you want to make.
