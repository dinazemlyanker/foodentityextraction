They\u2019re rich in fiber, omega-3s, antioxidants, and protein, with a sweet kick from copious dried fruit and a sprinkle of raw sugar. They don\u2019t need to be served with clotted cream or jam and are best enjoyed as a midday snack or an accompaniment to morning coffee.\u201dIngredientsMakes 6\u00bccup plus 2 Tbsp. (53 g) whole wheat flour\u00bdcup plus 1 Tbsp. (57 g) old-fashioned oats\u00bdtsp. ground cinnamon\u00bdtsp. baking powder\u00bctsp. baking soda\u215btsp. kosher salt6Tbsp. (\u00be stick) chilled unsalted butter, cut into \u00bd\" pieces\u00bccup plus 2 Tbsp. (47 g) all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting2Tbsp. raw sugar, plus more for sprinklingZest from 1 orange1cup (145 g) chopped pitted Medjool dates (about 16)1cup (145 g) golden raisins\u00bdcup (80 g) flaxseed\u00bdcup (45 g) sliced almonds\u2153cup (30 g) unsweetened shredded coconut6Tbsp. (55 g) dried black currants5Tbsp. (50 g) pumpkin seeds (pepitas)\u2153cup heavy cream, plus more for brushingPreparationStep 1Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 350\u00b0. Pulse whole wheat flour, oats, cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda, salt, butter, \u00bc cup plus 2 Tbsp. (47 g) all-purpose flour, and 2 Tbsp. raw sugar in a food processor until butter is no larger than pea-size, 5\u20137 pulses. Transfer to a large bowl; mix in orange zest, dates, raisins, flaxseed, almonds, coconut, currants, and pumpkin seeds. Toss by hand until well combined, then make a well in the center. Pour cream into well and toss vigorously with your hands (like a salad) until mixture comes together to form a dough.Step 2Transfer dough to a lightly floured surface and pat into a 6\"-diameter disk about 1\" thick. Using a large chef\u2019s knife, cut disk into 6 equal wedges. The dough will be crumbly and may fall apart as you cut it; don\u2019t be afraid to compact it back together.Step 3Arrange scones on a parchment-lined baking sheet, spacing at least 2\" apart. Lightly brush top of each scone with cream and sprinkle with raw sugar. Bake scones, rotating baking sheet front to back halfway through, until light golden, 25\u201330 minutes. Let scones cool on baking sheet before serving.Do ahead: Scones can be made 3 days ahead. Store airtight at room temperature.Reprinted from Mother Grains: Recipes for the Grain Revolution.

I've made them with dried figs, dried apricot, crystallized ginger, dried pineapple... Adjust the amount of cream slightly depending on how well the ingredients stick together. Always works great!RTNew York1/10/2022These definitely taste and feel like granola. Good flavor but very crumbly and rather dry. Followed the recipe to a T but I'd recommend trying a little more cream to see if they stick together better. You could break these up over yogurt and it would be almost like eating granola. I divided mine into 8 scones and they were still quite large. I think it would help to make them even smaller. Maybe 16 triangles or bake them in little balls. Then the fall-apart crumbliness wouldn't be so much of a problem.RoseSeattle, WA11/6/2021Cannot say enough about how wonderful these are!  Rough textured, but not touch. Not too sweet but so flavorful!  Beautiful with the dried cherries I subbed for raisins.  They have an incredible crust on the bottom (use parchment!) and freeze very well. A lovely thing to  put in a gift basket. As others mentioned, the dough is bit crumbly during assembly, but after baking, mine held together just fine.  I will never forget or lose this recipe and plan to enter it into competition at our State Fair next year (after seeing - but not tasting.- the competition this year!).CBKIndianapolis, IN8/13/2021Excellent and different scones! Definitely not a traditional cream scone, but that's what makes them so good. I didn't have any trouble with the crumbliness and they baked quite nicely. The final result is moist and tender. I used spelt flour instead of whole wheat and substituted dried apricots for half of the raisins. ElizabethSanta Barbara, CA3/27/2021I made them the first time, and found I had to pulse the figs and other dried fruits as well as the flax seed and oats. They were very crumbly and delicious. I used all whole wheat flour and added a 1/2 cup of dark chocolate chips. The second time, I added a quarter cup of 2% Greek yogurt to solve the crumbly problem and added a full cup of dark chocolate chips. I increased the orange zest and again pulsed the nuts, seeds, and fruits variously to make a more even crumb for the dough. Winner! Carol ConnareAmherst, MA3/8/2021These are absolutely delicious, and 1 scone is a meal in itself.  The dough is very dry and crumbly, and needs a lot of work to hold together.  But once baked, they are moist and yummy.  My husband has these on repeat request, as they fuel him completely before his bike rides.Jeanne P.Jacksonville, FL3/7/2021I loved everything about this scone! I would agree it's not your traditional scone, but I wasn't expecting it to be given all of the nuts, fruits and seeds added to the mix. It was light, and yes crumbly like granola but had so much depth and flavor. I substituted dried figs for the dates, and dried cherries for the raisins and cut mine into eights. I found them be just the right size for breakfast or an in-between-meal snack. I will definitely be making these again!Emily SmithPhiladelphia, Pa3/1/2021Disappointing. Dry and needed to be nuked and buttered to make it palatable but I was looking for something to take hiking or to eat while driving to trailheads. Flax seed is problematic and probably should be ground.HughCalgary, Alberta2/20/2021disappointing, got me in trouble! will revert back to classicNicolasBellevue, WA2/14/2021The flavor was good\u2014toasty and buttery like an oatmeal raisin cookie, but they are very crumbly and need more scone essence. The crumbliness might\u2019ve the oats as I\u2019ve had this issue with a different oat scone. I might try this concept of granola loading again but with another whole wheat scone base recipe that I use consistently.Morgan E.2/11/2021These were very delicious but verrrrry crumbly both in getting the dough together and eating. I had to add an extra 1-2 Tbsps of cream to the dough to get it to even remotely stick together, and had to pat the pieces back together after slicing. They looked like a hot mess but still tasted great! Next time I might try pulsing the fruit in the food processor to get them to meld into the dough better. SoapnanaChicago2/7/2021Excellent flavor, a bit crumbly but nonetheless moist. Not sure if it reminds me of granola but delicious with a cup of tea. Will repeat!
