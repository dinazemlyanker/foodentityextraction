He shares recipes he's been cooking, restaurants he's been eating at, and more. It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.Ever since editors have been writing editor\u2019s letters, editors have been turning them in late. We\u2019ve got too much on our plates, we tell our colleagues. Too many meetings. No time to write. And whatever other excuses we can drum up to explain our lack of productivity.Want this letter before it hits the website? Sign up for our newsletter!When I should\u2019ve been writing my editor\u2019s letter for the May issue, the lot of us were at 1 World Trade Center, clicking away on our laptops, dipping into the BA Test Kitchen to make espressos and nibble at whatever was set out on the tasting table. In other words, we were going to work\u2014which is what everyone was doing, right?But when I (finally) sat down to write it, it was Thursday, March 19. I was at home, having just logged off of yet another Zoom meeting. Simone, Marlon, and I were on Day 6 of self-isolation due to the coronavirus. Now, as I type this weekly newsletter to you on April 20, that May issue has finally arrived in print. Here\u2019s what I wrote, one month ago today:It\u2019s hard to imagine how we\u2019ll all be doing by the time you read this letter mid-April. We know things are going to get worse before they get better. And that\u2019s difficult to process.But I also know that I\u2019m incredibly heartened by how everyone on the BA team has responded to this crisis. We have figured out on the fly how to reinvent our jobs as we work remotely. We\u2019re now filming our wildly popular YouTube videos in our own apartments, selfie style. We\u2019re recording our podcast without a studio but with just as much enthusiasm, opinion, and yes, spirited bickering. We\u2019ve banded together to raise funds for and call attention to a restaurant industry that has been decimated this past month.And yes, we\u2019re still making a magazine. All of the content in our May issue was shot, written, and edited before COVID-19 turned our lives upside down. It was supposed to have been our Travel Issue. But as my boss, Anna Wintour, pointed out, perhaps splashing the word TRAVEL across the cover in all caps right now might not be the move. Hard to argue with her. But the stories behind the cover still shine. The recipes from Minneapolis\u2019s Union Hmong Kitchen\u2014which, by the way, were some of the best things we\u2019ve tested all year\u2014will be a boon to every home cook in America. Same with chef Ashleigh Shanti\u2019s breakfast indulgences at Benne on Eagle in Asheville, North Carolina. And as the weather warms, I recommend trying Andy Baraghani\u2019s easy-breezy produce-driven dishes that he cooked up last summer during an Ojai escape.Benne biscuits from Asheville\u2019s Benne on Eagle.\nPhoto by Emma FishmanReally, what we all need now more than ever is escape. I hope this Recipes to Transport You issue can provide just that. At the moment, turn to it for cooking advice and inspiration. Dog-ear the recipes you\u2019re aching to make. And when it\u2019s finally time for all of us to break free, use this issue as we originally intended it\u2014as your all-caps guide to TRAVEL.Explore Bon App\u00e9titAdam NewsletterRead MorecookingThere's No Better Time to\u2026 Make Yourself a Hot BreakfastBy Sasha LevineCoronavirusWhat To Do When Your Girlfriend Gets Sick?
