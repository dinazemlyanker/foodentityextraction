His latest project, The Underground Railroad, a series for Amazon Studios, is based on the novel by Colson Whitehead, himself a Pulitzer Prize winner. But we\u2019re not here to talk about accolades; we\u2019re here to talk about dinner.Who would you invite to your ideal dinner party and why?Ms. Toni Morrison, Eileen Ahearn, and [the actor] Andr\u00e9 Holland. Eileen was a lifelong friend of Ms. Morrison\u2019s. She works with the James Baldwin estate, which was how I got the rights to adapt If Beale Street Could Talk. One of the earliest screenings of Moonlight was a DVD that Eileen personally took to Ms. Morrison. I hear that Ms. Morrison loved the movie. So I would use this opportunity to talk to her about it. The only thing I remember her saying was that she thought Andr\u00e9 Holland was dreamy.Do any of your characters from film or TV get an invite?Yes, two characters from The Underground Railroad: John Valentine, who in our depiction owns a vineyard, so he\u2019d bring some bangin\u2019 wine, and Mingo, his nemesis in the show. They have this beautiful Booker T. Washington\u2014W.E.B. Du Bois dynamic, and at a dinner party you want a bit of friction.You\u2019ve got this mix of literary giants, fictional characters, and actors. What do you serve?Soul food. It\u2019s a way for me to bring some other people to the party. I used to have this roommate, Jesse Dubus. He made this fried chicken 12, 14 years ago where he brined it overnight and then deep-fried it. It was so good. I\u2019d get Jesse to come make the fried chicken. Joi McMillon, my editor on The Underground Railroad, Beale Street, and Moonlight, is from the South and makes the best mac \u2019n\u2019 cheese. And my partner Lulu\u2019s brother, Anthony Wang, is a great chef here in L.A.. Lulu and Anthony make really awesome vegan collard greens.You said a guest would bring outstanding wine. What wine do you have in mind?I\u2019ve become a wine enthusiast during the pandemic. We\u2019d have an excellent 1971 Barolo, Fontanafredda Barolo. And because I was born in 1979, we\u2019d also serve a Heitz Cellar Napa Valley cab.What kind of table setting do you have?We mostly use ceramics. We like the idea that someone handmade this thing that we\u2019re eating off of, and I\u2019m into decanters for the wine. We\u2019d pick a really nice crystal decanter. The color palette is warm, golden. Exposed filaments and candles.Tour Wine Decanter$100 at Crate and BarrelAnd what\u2019s the conversation starter?Lulu and I do these exercises where you sit across from the other person and just stare into their eyes for three minutes. We might start off with a staring silence to break the ice. We\u2019ve all been apart for so long that there\u2019s almost this instinct to blab everything out at the top. I want to ease into the night.Besides Moonlight, would you talk about any of your films?Only if Ms. Morrison would want to. Otherwise, I\u2019d be curious to hear what she thinks about the last year. We would all cede the floor to Ms. Morrison.Explore Bon App\u00e9titDream Dinner PartyRead MorecultureLana Condor\u2019s Dream Dinner Party Involves Pizza and a Giant CauldronBy Dawn DaviscultureCicely Tyson on the Star-Studded, Very Purple Dinner Party of Her DreamsBy Dawn DavisRecipes you want to make.
