Even though the actress lives in Los Angeles now, most of her favorite food memories are from living in Maine, eating brown butter crab, blueberry-topped panna cotta, and all kinds of fresh fish. (However, she doesn\u2019t freak out about lobster\u2014more on that later.) Below, the star of the upcoming thriller A Simple Favor (out September 14) shares some of her favorite dishes from growing up, how she feels about the burgeoning restaurant scene, her dream fast food meal, and a sneaky plan for entertaining at home. Oh, and her signature cocktail recipe, which you\u2019ll want to make immediately.Where do you eat when you\u2019re back home in Portland?Street & Co. for sure. It\u2019s one of the best restaurants in Portland. It is about as old world as you can get in the States. You can sit out on cobblestone streets and hear live music from the bar down the street. You get the benefit of the ambiance of live music but it\u2019s not right up against you.What\u2019s your go-to order?They have a lot of beautiful, fresh seafood, so I\u2019d usually just ask what was good today. But there was a brown butter crab appetizer that I would always look for on the menu and order immediately. They would put it on these bruschetta-style little toasties. Oh God. My mouth is watering thinking about it. It\u2019s so good.Growing up in Maine, were you always alllll about lobster?I don\u2019t actually flip out for lobster the way that I\u2019m supposed to. It\u2019s not like I grew up eating it so much that I got sick of it or something; it\u2019s not like I was bathing in lobster! But I had it really young and there wasn\u2019t a lot of pomp and circumstance around having it, so I was like, This is alright, I guess. My favorite thing at Street & Co. was always dessert. It\u2019s my favorite part of any meal, really, but this is the place that made me fall in love with high-end desserts.If you could only pick one dessert there, what would it be?Definitely the panna cotta. I know panna cotta is a little more prevalent now but at the time, it wasn\u2019t in a lot of restaurants! I get really angry when people put a really sweet sauce on it instead of a nice tart sauce because they always did a beautiful blueberry or blackberry sauce to cut that sweetness. I recently had a panna cotta that had a full-on caramel sauce on it and I was like, What are you doing?!Kendrick and Blake Lively in A Simple Favor.\nPeter Iovino/LionsgateHow do you feel about the shift in the restaurant scene?You expect your hometown to stay exactly the same. It was really nice to see that there are all these places cropping up. There\u2019s this cool brewery restaurant that opened on the water, Liquid Riot, and it\u2019s funny to see the hooligans my brother used to hang out with as chefs who make all this gorgeous food.  It\u2019s cool to see Portland having a kind of a sexy, restaurant revival moment.On the flip side, you love fast food. A few years ago you said you had to cut out Taco Bell. Have you stood by that, or are you still eating it?I\u2019m on and off the wagon in a huge way for sure. There was actually a night that I ordered it on Postmates. I got home really late and I said to myself, Screw it. I\u2019m ordering Taco Bell. I got one of those emails that said my order had been canceled. I was like, This is a sign. This is the universe telling me that I have to be better than this.If you could create a three-course tasting menu of fast food, what would be in it?The Taco Bell cheesy gordita crunch, a Jack In The Box breakfast sandwich, and probably a Wendy\u2019s frosty.What\u2019s your beverage pairing?I feel actually really embarrassed right now. If I\u2019m just having Taco Bell I\u2019m going to go whole hog and be really nasty and have a Mountain Dew. I\u2019m old school. If you\u2019re going to have the Taco Bell it\u2019s not like you\u2019re going to have Vitamin Water and pretend that your shame isn\u2019t real. Just have a Mountain Dew!Now that you\u2019ve established all your eating out habits, how do you like to cook at home?I\u2019ve been basically trying to crack really, really easy entertaining stuff. I don\u2019t mean like Martha Stewart easy. I mean actually really easy. The thing that people find really impressive but is literally no work is taking a baguette out of the oven just before people arrive. I don\u2019t lie and say that I made it fresh, but it\u2019s warm. There\u2019s this place Olive Hill Farm in Los Olivos that I buy olive oil and vinegar from, like cranberry pear balsamic vinegar and basil olive oil. I just cut up a baguette and let people dip. It\u2019s always such a hit, and no one knows it\u2019s no effort at all. I try to make it look all sexy. I\u2019m into anything that\u2019s no work but looks impressive.The Quarter Horse is Kendrick\u2019s go-to cocktail.\nPhoto by Alex LauIn your new movie, A Simple Favor, Blake Lively is obsessed with the perfect martini. Do you have a signature cocktail?I just started making a Quarter Horse. I haven\u2019t seen it on menus, but I don\u2019t know a ton about cocktails. I like drinking them, but I don\u2019t know a lot about them. I found it on a cocktail app that I have called Highball, and it\u2019s made with bourbon, lime, simple syrup, ginger beer, and bitters. It\u2019s like half Moscow Mule, half Old Fashioned. It will get you tipsy quickly but never give you a hangover. It\u2019s the dream. I\u2019m living the dream!Do you make them one at a time in a shaker, or a big batch?This is actually one of the things I really like about making them is there\u2019s no muddling or shaking it in a mixer. You just pour it in a glass and put some ice over it, and it tastes incredible, like a proper shaken cocktail. There are fewer dishes to do after you\u2019re done making it. Sometimes it feels very chic to be using a cocktail shaker, but sometimes you\u2019re like, Ugh. I\u2019ve got to clean all of this up.Here is the exact Quarter Horse recipe from the Highball app. Click here to enlarge.\nImage courtesy of Highball; illustration by Bryan FountainWhat other cocktails have you found on that app?I\u2019m also into a French 75 or a champagne cocktail moment. Mostly because I don\u2019t love just drinking champagne. I know how that sounds, like, Oh, I just hate diamonds. All I have to do is throw a sugar cube into champagne and add gin or cognac, and then I feel like I made something special.If you were thinking about lobster, though...Explore Bon App\u00e9titCelebritiesPortland MaineMaineRead MorerestaurantsPortland, Maine, Is the 2018 Restaurant City of the YearBy Andrew KnowltonRecipes you want to make.
