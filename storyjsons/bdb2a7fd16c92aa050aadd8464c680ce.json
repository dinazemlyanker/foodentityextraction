Submissions accepted through 12 p.m. Monday, June 1!No one misses the Test Kitchen more than Claire...\nGourmet Ferrero RocherThese crunchy, creamy, hazelnutty chocolate candies don\u2019t have the signature spherical wafer of the original Ferrero Rocher, but the layer of crushed up hazelnut wafer cookies comes pretty darn close. You don\u2019t have to temper the chocolate for the outer coating, but it\u2019s recommended to mimic the snappy texture of the wafer.Makes 12Ingredients1 cup raw hazelnuts, preferably blanched\u00bc cup chocolate-hazelnut spread6 oz. hazelnut wafer cookies (such as Loacker)8 oz. semisweet chocolate, coarsely choppedInstructionsPlace a rack in middle of oven and preheat to 350\u00b0. Toast hazelnuts on a small rimmed baking sheet until golden brown, 10\u201312 minutes. If your hazelnuts are unblanched, wrap them in a clean kitchen towel and rub them vigorously to loosen any bits of papery brown skin; discard skins. Let nuts cool.Set 12 hazelnuts aside for the filling; finely chop remaining nuts. Transfer to a fine-mesh sieve and shake to sift out any tiny particles; discard. Then, working over a medium bowl, press nuts through the holes of a colander, letting the mid-size pieces fall into the bowl and reserving the large pieces in the colander. Chop larger pieces again, then repeat sifting process in sieve and colander until all of the nuts have passed through the colander and are free of fine particles (they should all be about the same size). Set chopped nuts aside.To make the centers of the Ferrero Rocher, dollop a level teaspoonful of chocolate-hazelnut spread onto a 3\u201d square of plastic wrap. Repeat process until you have 12 dollops, each on its own square of plastic wrap. Press a reserved whole hazelnut into each dollop. Working one at a time, gather corners of each plastic square up and over filling to meet in the center to form a little purse, then pinch all of the edges together, squeezing out any air, and twist to force the filling into a tight, round-ish bundle. Place bundles on a plate or rimmed baking sheet and freeze until solid, 30\u201340 minutes.Meanwhile, place cookies inside a large resealable plastic bag and close, pressing out any air. Using a rolling pin or a wooden spoon, lightly crush cookies until you have small pieces no larger than a lentil. Transfer crumbs to a medium bowl.Melt 2 oz. chocolate in a medium heatproof bowl set over a small saucepan filled with 1\u201d of barely simmering water, stirring with a heatproof rubber spatula until smooth. Remove bowl from heat and place on work surface next to bowl of cookie crumbs. Reserve saucepan with water.Transfer a heaping tablespoonful of cookie crumbs to a small bowl, then add 1 tsp. melted chocolate and stir until evenly mixed and chocolate has bound crumbs into a moldable consistency. Remove 1 filling bundle from freezer and carefully unwrap on work surface. Set filling on surface to the side of the plastic; carefully spread crumb mixture onto the square to make about a 2\u201d-diameter circle. Place still-frozen filling in center of circle, then use plastic wrap to work and mold crumb mixture up and around filling, enclosing it completely in a rough sphere. Wrap plastic around cookie mixture, then roll between your palms to form into a smooth sphere. Place sphere in refrigerator. Repeat process with remaining crumbs, melted chocolate, and filling. Chill balls until chocolate is set, 25\u201330 minutes.Scrape any remaining melted chocolate into another bowl or airtight container; cover and set aside for another use. Place 4.5 oz. chocolate in bowl. Bring water in reserved saucepan back up to a simmer, then remove from the heat. Place bowl of chocolate over saucepan and stir chocolate often with spatula, scraping sides, until melted and an instant-read thermometer registers 113\u00b0. Remove bowl from saucepan and add remaining 1.5 oz. chocolate. Stir vigorously until most of seed chocolate is melted and thermometer registers 82\u00b0. Place bowl back over saucepan and stir constantly until thermometer registers 90\u00b0. Chocolate should now be tempered and ready to use.Leaving bowl of chocolate over saucepan to keep chocolate warm, tilt bowl so chocolate pools to one side. Remove balls from refrigerator and, working one at a time, unwrap and dip in chocolate to coat completely. Using a fork, lift out of chocolate, allowing excess to drip back into bowl, then carefully transfer to bowl of chopped nuts. Toss in nuts until fully coated, then transfer to a wire rack. Repeat with remaining balls, tempered chocolate, and chopped nuts.When all the balls are coated, dab about 1 tsp. chocolate in one of your palms (it\u2019s helpful to wear gloves for this) and roll a ball between your palms to completely cover nuts in a thin layer of chocolate, adding more chocolate as needed; return to rack. Repeat until all of the balls are coated. Let sit at room temperature until chocolate is set, which, if it\u2019s well tempered, should only take a few minutes. Reserve any leftover chocolate for another use.Do Ahead: Homemade Ferrero Rochers can be made 5 days ahead.
