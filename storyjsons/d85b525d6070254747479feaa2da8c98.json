In Priya Krishna\u2019s new cookbook Indian-ish, it\u2019s the roti pizza, the quinoa kheer, the saag feta\u2014all the twists on Indian dishes that were invented by her family in their Dallas home. If you\u2019ve been following along with us, you may already be familiar with some of them (like a vegetarian sloppy joe called pav bhaji, a bright and spicy grilled cheese called dahi toast, or baked potatoes with chat masala) from her column of the same name, which I very happily edit here on bonappetit.com. Now with a whole book of Indian-ish recipes to dig into, we\u2019re making it our Cookbook Club pick for the month of April.If you\u2019ve never made Indian food at home, Indian-ish is going to get you into chhonk (spices tempered in oil), dal (stewy lentils), and kachumber (cucumber or other raw veg salads). But this isn\u2019t Indian food 101. The country spans over a billion people, hundreds of languages, and a multitude of regional cuisines, and these recipes are uniquely Krishna\u2014which means they\u2019re really fun, creative, comforting, and unyielding. (Yes, we\u2019re sprinkling chaat masala on almond butter toast, IT WILL BE GOOD. TRUST.)Most of the recipes are Priya\u2019s mother Ritu\u2019s\u2014a software programmer, wine lover, pottery collector, and style icon. (She likes to pair kurtas with gold Zara pants, and believes strongly in the power of statement jewelry.) Ritu and her husband Shailendra came to the U.S. in the early \u201980s, and longing for the Indian food of home, she taught herself to cook with help from PBS and relatives she called for guidance.The results, however, are entirely her own. There\u2019s Indian Ribollita, which adds Indian green chiles to the classic the Italian soup; roti pizzas, Ritu\u2019s response to her pizza-demanding daughters, made with cheddar, onion, and cilantro chutney; a sunshine yellow caramelized onion dal. It\u2019s \u201c60 percent traditional Indian, 40 percent Indian-plus-something-else, mostly vegetarian,\u201d Priya writes in the introduction. And you can tell Ritu thinks about cooking the way she dresses, and that\u2019s with one goal in mind: be fabulous.After Priya gathered and tweaked her mother\u2019s recipes, added some of her own, and narrowed down her list for Indian-ish, I was lucky to be one of her many enthusiastic recipe testers for the book. And I can vouch for the simple but stunning one-pan Lotus Root and Jammy Tomatoes (there\u2019s a great texture mashup from the crisp lotus root up against velvety tomatoes) and the instant classic Spinach and Feta Cooked Like Saag Paneer. Priya was, and I say this out of admiration, neurotically obsessed with making sure the recipes were accessible, downright easy, delicious, and that they worked. I don\u2019t want to know how many Google docs made this happen. (Okay, she told me how many, it was a LOT.)Doesn\u2019t that look gooooood?\nI\u2019m excited to see what my coworkers make for our Indian-ish cookbook feast, which feels like an extra special occasion to me\u2014a selfish editor who\u2019s unendingly proud of Priya as a writer, friend, and now cookbook author. There\u2019s a deluge of spring cookbooks coming out, but none have what Indian-ish does: heart, humor, and chaat masala on almond butter toast.Pre-order it: Indian-ish by Priya Krishna, $18 on amazon.comExplore Bon App\u00e9titIndianishcookbook clubCookbooksIndianRecipes you want to make.
