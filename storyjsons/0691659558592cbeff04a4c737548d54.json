This easy cod recipe is too good to quit.By Rachel KartenApril 12, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Alex Lau, food styling by Rebecca Jurkevich, prop styling by Emily EisenFacebookTwitterEmailWelcome to Never Fail, a weekly column where we wax poetic about the recipes that never, ever let us down.Every staffer at BA has a recipe that they are most associated with. Alex Delany loves these sambal skewers. Emily Schultz makes Healthyish\u2019s yogurt flatbread on the reg. When I think of Christina Chaey, I think of this steamed fish. Carey Polis loves this sausage, greens, and beans pasta. Me? It is, without a doubt, this easy cod recipe: Slow-Cooked White Fish with Charred Cabbage.\u201cOh, you brought in your cod thing,\u201d is a comment I get from nosy coworkers at least once a week as I sit down with my lunch. Because yes, I make this recipe, which was originally developed by Andy Baraghani for Healthyish\u2019s Feel Good Food Plan, about that often. But that\u2019s because this recipe is highly adaptable, super simple (only seven ingredients!), and exactly what I crave on a Monday when I spent the weekend eating whatever the opposite of \"Feel Good Food\" is.First, there\u2019s the \u201cslow-cooked\u201d cod. I used quotation marks there because I don\u2019t want to lose you with that term. When it comes to a firm, white fish like cod, slow-cooked really means 15 minutes in the oven. Easy! Rub the filet with olive oil, zest some grapefruit on top, season with salt then throw it in the oven. The end result is a perfectly-flaky, bright-tasting piece of fish.Next, the charred cabbage. Which is 100 percent my favorite way to cook cabbage. You tear about a quarter of a head of the green stuff (I\u2019ve tried using purple here, it\u2019s not as good) into pieces and cook in a pan over medium-high heat. Do! Not! Move! Them! The goal here is to really get good color on each ripped piece. Stir for a second, season, and then let them sit a little longer. Et voil\u00e0: super flavorful, sorta-smoky cabbage that only took five minutes to make. Add it to your plate. Top with some grapefruit rounds. Add the flaked cod. Drizzle the whole thing with olive oil. Crack lots of fresh pepper. And that\u2019s it! Extreme infomercial voice: But wait! There\u2019s more!Since I make this thing every damn week I\u2019ve tried out a whole lot of modifications and swaps. I pretty much always add torn Castelvetrano olives, cilantro, and a sprinkle of Aleppo pepper. When the store only has sad-looking cod, I\u2019ll swap in a handsome hunk of salmon. I\u2019ve also been known to char some shishito peppers before the cabbage when I\u2019m feeling spicy-ish. So many options! If I was doing a TED Talk, I\u2019d say some inspirational line about how the possibilities are endless with this perfect recipe, and it\u2019s up to you to take advantage of them. But I\u2019m not. I\u2019m just here writing about the Cod Thing. My Cod Thing.Said easy cod recipe, right this way:Slow-Cooked White Fish with Charred CabbageSometimes with cooking, the best thing you can do is leave a thing alone. In this case, let the cabbage leaves sit and get charred around the edges before you even think about tossing them in the pan.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titBasicallyNever FailCodFishCabbageRecipes you want to make.
