Keep the beans submerged in the broth in the refrigerator so they won\u2019t dry out; plus, they\u2019ll continue to soak up all that flavor. This recipe is from 2M Smokehouse in San Antonio, TX.Ingredients8 servings1lb. dried pinto beans, soaked overnight12garlic cloves, lightly smashed1Tbsp. beef bouillon paste4tsp. kosher salt, plus more\u00betsp. ground coriander\u00betsp. ground cumin\u00betsp. garlic powder\u00betsp. onion powder\u00bdtsp. cayenne pepper1small white onion, chopped1medium tomato, chopped\u00bdcup chopped cilantroPreparationStep 1Drain beans, place in a large pot, and add 10 cups water to cover.
