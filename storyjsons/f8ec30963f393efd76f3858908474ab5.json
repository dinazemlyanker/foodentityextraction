When something's so easy to make that you don't even need one. Welcome to It's That Simple, a column where we talk you through the process of making the dishes and drinks we can make with our eyes closed.The first truly perfect dinner I had at a restaurant was at Buvette when I was visiting New York in high school. A tiny French bistro in the West Village run by Jody Williams, Buvette is as alluring for its food as for its ability to transport you to Paris. But the food! The food is really good.Somewhere between the rich brandade, the fall-apart coq au vin, and a truly luxe chocolate mousse came an unsuspecting course\u2014the underdog, even. It was a chunky walnut pesto, served on perfect crusty bread.Lucky for me, Williams published the pesto recipe in Buvette\u2019s eponymous cookbook\u2014which I got my hands on right before moving to NYC to set up shop as someone resembling a grown-up. That recipe accompanied me across the country and then from apartment to apartment. I\u2019ve changed a couple of small things as I\u2019ve made it over the years, serving it with way more than toasted bread.Here\u2019s how my take goes: First, heat your oven to 350\u00b0 F. Then, scoop 1 generous cup of raw walnuts onto a baking tray and pop them in the oven to toast. Here\u2019s a helpful guide for toasting. (For the record, Williams uses raw nuts, but to me, the toasty flavor takes things to the next level.)While the walnuts are turning deeply golden brown, peel 1 small garlic clove, grate \u00bc cup parmesan cheese, pick 2 tsp. fresh thyme leaves from their spindly stems (or really, another herb like rosemary or fresh oregano would do too), and finely chop 2 Tbsp. sun-dried tomatoes. I know, I know. But before you run in the other direction thinking that I must be insane for touting a recipe that calls for controversial sun-dried tomatoes, just hear me out: They\u2019re good in this! Slightly sweet and slightly acidic, they fill out the background rather than announce themselves front and center as they\u2019ve been known to do. And, well, it just works.Have I convinced you? Okay, good, because the walnuts are definitely done toasting by now. Once they\u2019ve cooled, transfer them to a food processor (shout out to my more affordable, more space-efficient mini one), along with the garlic clove, the parm, and 1 tsp. sherry vinegar. Pulse until coarsely chopped.Transfer that mixture to a bowl, stir in the sun-dried tomatoes and about \u00bc cup extra-virgin olive oil, and season with salt to taste.I do, indeed, eat this pesto on toasted bread. But I\u2019ve also spooned a dollop over roasted vegetables for added crunch, served it with chicken and with steak, and used it as a spread on sandwiches, a dip for crudit\u00e9s, and, when loosened up with some pasta water and more cheese, a pasta sauce.No matter how it\u2019s served, though, it takes me back to the tiny, bustling dining room at Buvette\u2014an imaginary trip I can always use, and especially now.Explore Bon App\u00e9titIt's That SimpleRecipes you want to make.
