The resulting colorful, crunchy, woken-up sabzi is an easy side that you can make in 20 minutes or less. You can also double it for an excellent vegetarian main course. Even better: Warm up some tortillas and scramble some eggs, and you\u2019ve got yourself an Indo-Texan breakfast taco party.\u00a0Excerpted from Indian-ish \u00a9 2019 by Priya Krishna with Ritu Krishna.

Served with some grilled naanAnonymous2/20/2022Super fast, tasty recipe. The spices were very fragrant which was definitely what made the dish. I added cubed tofu to the mix, which was excellent, and I would recommend it. Thank you, Bon Appetit!AbbeySouth Carolina, USA7/7/2021Surprisingly good and easy, even with  orange bell peppers and white potato. Used a bit less salt, and lemon instead of lime juice. Keeper. FranMexico 11/16/2020Surprisingly good and easy, even with orange bell pepper and white potato. Used a bit less salt, and lemon instead of lime juice. Also cashews, due to peanut allergy. Keeper.FranMexico11/16/2020This was delightful.  Full disclosure: in this shelter-in-place era of infrequent grocery shopping and limited supplies when you get there; I used sweet potatoes instead of white and completely skipped the peanuts.  This works fine as a tray bake if you don't want to tend a skillet, I found the oven method required a bit more olive oil.  AnonymousSan Francisco4/16/2020Simple, tasty & quick. Not much else to say.AnonymousToronto4/6/2020This was amazing and easy to prepare!  mikermealsChicago, Illinois1/19/2020This was amazing! It was so easy to make and so delicious. Loved the smell and taste of spices! AnonymousLithuania11/28/2019Great, quick recipe for a tasty side.  Potatoes took significantly longer to cook through than 10 minutes but still a simple preparation.  I added some chopped cilantro to finish and it was a big hit.  Will definitely make it again - though next time I'll double it to have leftovers.Northern California11/7/2019I'm shook. Priya is a legend for monetizing on Indian Americans' two-minute-lazy-af recipes. Anonymous11/1/2019Thanks Priya for introducing me to this delicious dish!  The smell of cumin seeds, fennel seeds, and onions in olive oil was heaven.Toby CurtisEhime, Japan10/31/2019I've made something similar to this sans spices and with white beans. It's great comfort food.AnonymousChicago, IL10/30/2019I made this for dinner with scrambled eggs, cilantro, and hot sauce. It came out amazing!
