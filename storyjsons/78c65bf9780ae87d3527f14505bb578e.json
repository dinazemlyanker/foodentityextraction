Here the tomato sauce cooks in the oven at the same time the squash roasts; combine the two, return the dish to the oven, and you\u2019ve got a hands-off dinner with minimal cleanup. Serve this with bread and a green salad one night, then mix leftovers into pasta for \u201cnoodles\u201d on noodles the next.\u00a0Halving the squash crosswise is a tip we learned from cookbook writer and food blogger Alexandra Stafford; it involves easier (and safer!) knife work and results in longer, more noodle-like strands. The bake time of the squash depends on the squash itself\u2014anecdotally and with no scientific backing, I\u2019ve found that smaller, yellower spaghetti squashes tend to cook faster and taste better. \u2014Sarah JampelAll products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Regular weeknight meal stapleAnonymous2/27/2022I've made this a few times and it's become a staple dish. It's absolutely delicious!\nI love the way the sauce is created by simply baking the hand-squished canned tomatoes. It's genius!\nTry this and I promise you it will become a staple in your house, too.Ellen M.Hudson Valley, NY2/19/2022This is delicious, and I know I will make it again.  I used a small can of tomatoes, though, and not the larger one.  I cooked the tomatoes for about 20 minutes, and that was enough.  I am wondering if next time I could add steamed chard or spinach to it during the bake - maybe when you put the tomatoes in.  I think I will try it.  FrancesNapaNapa, CA2/10/2022I made a weeknight riff on this. I par-microwaved, oiled and seasoned it, and roasted on high heat until stringy. Then mixed with doctored jarred marinara (with 1/2 lb. browned ground beef) and topped with dollops of cheesy-herby-eggy mixture and a blend of fresh shredded cheese. It was very tasty and not as wet/mushy as I'd feared. The creamy mixture is a must in my book.\n\nServed with broccoli sauteed with garlic, fennel seed, and chili flake.ChristinaMAsheville, NC2/8/2022@Donna I like the Trader Joe's vegan mozzarella!Sarah Jampel2/3/2022If anyone makes this with vegan mozzarella or vegan parmesan I'd like to know what brands you like.  I tried Miyoko's vegan mozzarella, not in this dish, and did not like it.DonnaNew York City1/31/2022I made it with veggie \"meat\" balls and it was delicious. Everyone loved it. My only complaint is that it didn't have a calorie count listed.Laura NaylorEastern Shore of Virginia1/25/2022So delicious! I made it 100% plant-based by using vegan mozzarella and vegan parmesan \u2013 just as tasty (if not tastier), healthier, and to me most important of all ... cruelty free. No animals suffered to so I could enjoy a meal. Win-win!Anonymous1/24/2022Are the crushed tomatoes in the baking dish put in the oven at the same time the squash is baked on the parchment paper (but take tomatoes out after 35-40 min)? Or am I supposed to bake the squash first for an hour and then put the tomatoes in for 40 min?Anonymous1/24/2022This recipe was absolutely delicious! I used about a 4# squash and the quantities were still great. Definitely make sure it is seasoned well before the final broil! Will make again! Sally Jane New York, NY 1/19/2022This recipe is so versatile! So many other recipes result in bland, boring spaghetti squash, but this one was great.  The techniques used are fantastic for flavorful spaghetti squash and it's super easy to sub in whatever you have at hand. I threw in some fresh thyme and feta instead of mozzarella with delicious results.ElizabethSanta Barbara, CA1/12/2022Just made this, incredibly delicious. Some changes due to not having exact ingredients. Used 1 can diced tomatoes, 1 tablespoon tomato paste and 1 teaspoon anchovy paste. It was sooo good, had 3 helpings. Best use of spaghetti squash ever. AnonymousHelena MT1/9/2022looking forward to trying this recipe will keep u posted?Anonymouscanada1/8/2022I wish Spaghetti Squash were more readily available in stores.   I'm going to grow more this year, because of recipes like this.\nVery tasty!  An Arrabbiata style sauce over Spaghetti Squash all baked in the oven.  Once the cheese melted... Mmmmm!
