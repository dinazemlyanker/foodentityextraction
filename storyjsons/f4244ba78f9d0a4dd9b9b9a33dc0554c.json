I seem to be the only person on my block who hangs halfway out of their front door (masked, of course) to shoot food photos in natural light. I may never be able to re-create the bright light and distinctive marble surfaces we use when shooting recipe photos in the BA Test Kitchen, but I don\u2019t worry because there\u2019s one thing that makes my photos look amazing, even at home: Jono Pandolfi ceramics.On my only visit to the test kitchen since March, I snagged a couple of Jono Pandolfi\u2019s Alaska coupe bowls that we used to use for food shoots. Having some beautiful ceramics at home transforms my (often) half-assed lunches into food that looks like it might actually belong on Instagram. Some old lentils with an avocado? Put them in Jono\u2019s turquoise-glazed bowl and top with some herbs and olive oil, and, suddenly, lunch looks like it took longer than 3 minutes to throw together. Forgot some rice on the stovetop while trying to explain the difference between addition and subtraction to your kid? Dump it on an understated brown clay-rimmed plate and put an egg and some chile crisp on it, and that singed rice starts looking pleasantly crunchy. That\u2019s the Pandolfi magic.Jono\u2019s plates and bowls hit that sweet spot of making anything you put on them look great by embracing organic shapes and textures and restraining the use of color to those hues that don\u2019t take away from the food sitting on top of them. Yes, they make your food look better. But more important, they make it look like you really tried, even when that just isn\u2019t true.Don\u2019t get me wrong. I\u2019m not the kind of person who has tall stacks of beautiful ceramics in every corner of my cabinets. If, post-pandemic, more than two friends come over for dinner, we are going to be eating off the uninspired old beige dinner plates I panic-bought before my first big dinner party 17 years ago. But you won\u2019t catch me photographing anything on them. I\u2019ve got my precious Jono Pandolfi ceramics for the photo shoot.Photo by Emma Fishman8\" Coupe Alaska Bowl$45 at Jono PandolfiExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendproductShoppingRecipes you want to make.
