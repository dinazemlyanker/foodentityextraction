Maybe a strong suggestion, but a suggestion nevertheless. I understood on a vague level that cake flour would make a cake more fluffy and tender, but I figured I could skip it (who would notice, with no superior cake with which to compare it?) or use the internet\u2019s widely circulated workaround: Replace 2 Tbsp. of every 1 cup AP flour with cornstarch.But all of that was before I started reading BakeWise, a definitive cook-slash-text-book by the biochemist (and my personal idol) Shirley Corriher. Simply put, writes Corriher, \u201cYou will get a different texture and taste in a cake using cake flour.\u201d On the ingredient list for her Magnificent Moist Golden Cake, which was my inspiration for this No-Mixer Vanilla Cake, Corriher states that there is \u201cNO SUBSTITUTE\u201d (her caps, not mine) for cake flour: The cake \u201cwill be sunken in the center and simply will not work correctly if other flour is used.\u201dSo what is cake flour and what's so special about it?For starters, cake flour is low-protein (typically 5\u20138% protein as compared to 10\u201313% for AP), and that\u2019s because it\u2019s milled from low-protein (a.k.a. soft) wheat. This means it does not produce as much gluten as regular AP flour and can yield more light, tender results. (It also means it will not make a good loaf of bread.)But that\u2019s not all. Cake flour is also very finely ground, \u201cwith a silky-smooth texture that produces a fine-textured cake,\u201d explains Corriher (you might see it labeled as extra fine or superfine flour). Because it\u2019s so fine, it has more surface area, meaning it can absorb more liquid. Being able to add more liquid to a cake also makes it possible to add more sugar without compromising the structure. (Since sugar is hygroscopic\u2014moisture-sucking\u2014increasing its quantity goes hand in hand with increasing the amount of liquid; otherwise, there\u2019s not enough moisture leftover to hydrate the flour.) And why would you want to add more sugar? It makes for a moister, longer-lasting cake with a tighter, finer, plusher crumb, akin to a wedding cake from a fancy bakery.On top of all that, according to the Bob\u2019s Red Mill website, cake flour also assists with the even distribution of fats and helps cakes rise higher.What\u2019s the deal with bleached cake flour?Maybe you\u2019ve noticed that many common brands of cake flour, like the popular Swan\u2019s Down, are bleached. In BakeWise, Corriher describes the unique advantages of bleached cake flour over its unbleached counterparts: The bleaching process lowers flour\u2019s pH, alters its starch so it can absorb water and swell, mellows its taste, and helps with even fat distribution.But since the publication of BakeWise, King Arthur Baking Company released its unbleached, unenriched cake flour, which Cook\u2019s Illustrated found to yield results \u201cvirtually identical to those of bleached cake flour.\u201d That\u2019s what I prefer and what I used to develop this cake.Unbleached and Unenriched Cake Flour$5 at King Arthur Baking Company$13 at AmazonIt is worth noting, however, that in her book BraveTart, Stella Parks calls for bleached cake flour\u2014which she calls \u201ca remarkably delicate flour in every sense of the word\u201d\u2014particularly for her angel food cake. point is: For the best results, follow the recipe and its specifications, especially when you\u2019re making something as delicate as a cake.But I need to know: Does the substitute work?Parks calls the idea of swapping out cake flour for a mixture of AP and cornstarch \u201ca life hack that utterly misses the point\u201d\u2014but I must admit to having used it with, as far as I can tell, with at least moderate success. Employ the trick at your own risk and, I would recommend, in recipes that only call for a small amount of flour total.But when your entire multilayer cake hinges on a large amount of cake flour, buy the cake flour. (It usually comes in fairly small quantities anyway, and, unlike whole wheat flours, will last a good while in your pantry.) A bakery-style cake\u2014tender, moist, tall, sweet, buttery\u2014will make that extra box in the pantry more than worthwhile.Get the recipe:No-Mixer Vanilla Cake With Tangy Cream Cheese FrostingExtremely plush, fine-crumbed, and dare-we-say moist, this is like the best wedding cake\u2014and you mix it entirely by hand.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titCakeBakeBasically BakingFlourRecipes you want to make.
