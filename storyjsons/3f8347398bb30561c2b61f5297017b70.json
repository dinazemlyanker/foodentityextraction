I shaved some cheap Parmesan with a potato peeler. I used 1 tbsp raw honey, 1 tbsp sherry vin and 1 tbsp red wine vin and lots of black pepper.  I thought it was good, my mom thought it was fantastic. The pear was a good touch. Next time I'd use a higher quality Parmesan and an herb - mint or basil. EllyHood River, OR10/7/2021A friend gave us a bag of freshly picked plums from her garden, so made this salad for lunch. Surprising and delicious! SusanVictoria, British Columbia9/6/2021WOWZA!
