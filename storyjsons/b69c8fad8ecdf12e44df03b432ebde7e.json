Or maybe you\u2019ve spotted it on Goop (it\u2019s one of Gwyneth Paltrow\u2019s favorite detoxifiers) or CAP Beauty (owner Kerrilynn Palmer swears by it when she\u2019s feeling sick). Or you read that Olympian Natalie Coughlin swears by it as her post-swim routine. Or you\u2019ve perused the many rave reviews of it on the Internet. \u201cI woke up with super-soft, glowy skin that\u2014swear to god\u2014had an ever-so-slightly spicy scent that lasted the whole next day,\u201d declares one on marieclaire.com.That container is Dr. Singha\u2019s Mustard Bath, a fine, beige, herbaceous powder that\u2019s become the wellness world\u2019s de rigueur sick-day cure. It contains eucalyptus, rosemary, wintergreen, and thyme (plus sodium carbonate, or baking soda, and gum benzoin, a medicinal tree resin), but the key ingredient is mustard seed, which, according to Ayurveda\u2014the ancient Indian system of healthcare\u2014rejuvenates your skin, decreases stress, and increases blood flow. Recently, products like Dr. Singha\u2019s Mustard Bath have ballooned in popularity in the Western world. With cookbooks, consultancies, food products, speaking engagements, and skin ointments, Ayurveda is now a cash cow industry\u2014ironic for a system of medicine that frowns upon materialism. And a lot of these products, many of which are named for gurus real and imagined, seem to have little to do with the practice itself. So when I heard about Dr. Singha and his mustard bath, I wondered who this guy was, whether he was legit, and most importantly, if his product was the magic bullet so many proclaimed it to be.I\u2019ve forever been skeptical of cult ayurvedic products because I grew up on home remedies similar to the sorts of practices outlined in ayurvedic medicine\u2014my aunt rubbed coconut oil into my hair to make it silky, my mom made face masks out of turmeric and yogurt to clear up blemishes, and my dad still swears by psyllium husk to regulate his digestive system. These remedies were inexpensive, they often took advantage of household items, and they weren\u2019t wrapped in flashy packaging or faux-esoteric labels. Most importantly: these were techniques that had been passed down in our family over generations.The eponymous Dr. Singha\nPhoto courtesy of Dr. SinghaFirst I went in search of Dr. Singha. I called up Anna Searles, a soft-spoken British woman and longtime patient of Dr. Singha\u2019s (he was, in fact, a real person) who founded the company with him in 1990, and has kept it running since his passing in 2000. She gave me an extensive history of Dr. Singha\u2019s life\u2014how he was raised in a spiritual community in the Himalayas, studied ayurvedic medicine in India, and opened the first School of Acupuncture in Great Britain in 1964, earning a loyal fan base for his healing method known as the mustard bath. In 1990, Searles suggested that Dr. Singha start selling the bath. As Searles tells it, Dr. Singha wanted little part of the mass commercialization of his practices: \u201cHe looked at me said, with a twinkle in his eye,  \u2018You do it!\u2019 So here we are.\u201d Searles, on Dr. Singha\u2019s wishes, hasn\u2019t done any kind of advertising for the product\u2014but it has experienced a meteoric rise since its launch, especially in the past few years, as sustainability and the organic movement gain even more traction.\u201cIt\u2019s not rocket science,\u201d she explains of the success of the bath. \u201cThere is just a hunger inside people to do the intelligent thing by creating wellness in their lives.\u201dAnna spoke of Dr. Singha in an apotheotic way \u2014 like this figure who suddenly entered her life and transformed her entire outlook. So I have to admit: it\u2019s hard for me to completely understand or believe everything she\u2019s telling me about Dr. Singha\u2019s miracle health solutions. That said, one thing that does resonate: unlike a lot of other Ayurvedic empires out there, Dr. Singha kept his business pretty small\u2014just his practice and a few products like the bath, a health tonic, and a mustard rub.Dr. Singha's mustard bath\nSo I decided to give his mustard bath a chance, ordering it on Amazon for the refreshingly affordable price of 10 dollars for an 8-ounce container. The Dr. Singha\u2019s label instructs you to add a scoop of powder to a hot bath, relax in it for 20 minutes, then \u201cfinish with a cold shower, dry with a rough towel, rest and keep warm for best results.\u201d I drew a hot bath after a long workout (the kind that leaves your muscles extra achy), and poured the powder into the tub, as instructed. The water promptly turned an unappealing shade of lemon-lime Gatorade. It smelled nice, though, as Dr. Singha smartly thought to add the herbs to counter the potent smell of the mustard. As I stepped in, I started to feel like an Alka-Seltzer tablet being dropped into water. Everything fizzed, and, for a few moments, my whole body felt effervescent. Soon, my skin started to look glossy. I hung around in the bath for the prescribed 20 minutes, then took a cold shower and even dried myself off with a rough towel, per the instructions.Afterward, I felt\u2026 fine. My muscles felt no less achy. Even though my skin felt smooth and velvety in the bath, it didn\u2019t look much different after I got out. If my blood flow had improved, I didn\u2019t notice. The mustard bath, to me, was nothing more than a really satisfying bath bomb.I don\u2019t doubt that, for many people, this bath is a total game-changer. For me, trying the bath was a good reminder that, as legitimate as Dr. Singha may be, what works for my friends or that person on the internet won\u2019t necessarily do the same thing for me. And it\u2019s okay to stick to the stuff that works when you\u2019re feeling sick: Tylenol, a cup of green tea, a good, old-fashioned Netflix binge.So I\u2019ll probably give the rest of this mustard bath to a friend. Because, for me, ayurvedic medicine will always be about those remedies I grew up on\u2014the things you can make from the items you have at home. I suppose I could recreate the mustard bath with some hot water, baking soda, and ground mustard seed from my spice cabinet. But I\u2019ll stick with my yogurt masks and chai for now.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishGet WellTrendsRead MoreLifestyleThe Healthyish Guide to Feeling Better AlreadyGallery13 SlidesBy The Healthyish TeamRecipes you want to make.
