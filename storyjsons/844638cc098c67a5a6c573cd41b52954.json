The implication, I guess, is that something from a jar can\u2019t be that tasty\u2014and that a homemade version of queso must be inherently better for you, right?Well, consider that the Queso, Not From a Jar recipe starts off by calling for half a pound of American cheese...and I\u2019ll just leave it at that. Queso is queso, and if you try to make an all-natural version with real cheese, good luck. (Just ask Sohla El-Waylly, who tried in vain when she developed this recipe.)So that brings us to Tostitos Salsa Con Queso (from a jar). Yes, I scolded my 12-year-old when he brought it home from the grocery store. I told him that we don\u2019t eat stuff like that in our house. And then I proceeded to heat some up in a little pot and absolutely demolish it with him.The queso is \u201cMedium,\u201d thanks to the addition of real jalape\u00f1os along with chopped red peppers and tomatoes. (There\u2019s also something called sodium hexametaphosphate in the ingredient list, but what did you expect? It\u2019s in a jar.) So, yes, this queso\u2019s got some bite, and it\u2019s velvety smooth, and it absolutely refuses to ever congeal. I like it warm with a bowl of chips, but I\u2019ve also spread it on a skillet-toasted tortilla when assembling a breakfast taco.Just to make sure I wasn\u2019t losing my mind, I texted Alex Beggs, our resident snack expert. She wrote an entire feature story on crispy foods and, in the name of research, visited the Frito-Lay headquarters in Plano, Texas. Beggs texted back immediately: \u201cYes, it\u2019s certifiably good.\u201dAnd there you have it.Buy it: Tostitos Salsa Con Queso, $4 at TargetAll products featured on Bonappetit.com are independently selected by our editors.
