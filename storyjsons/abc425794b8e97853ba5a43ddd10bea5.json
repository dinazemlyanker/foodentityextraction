Toasting the pine nuts until they\u2019re properly golden brown to the center and not just on the surface is key in coaxing out maximum flavor. That said, pine nuts are expensive and can burn, so keep a close eye on them as they cook. This recipe is from Montreal\u2019s cozy-cool coffee-pizza-wine restaurant Elena, and goes great with this Giardiniera Antipasto Platter.IngredientsMakes about 1 cup\u00bccup pine nuts\u00bccup grapeseed or vegetable oil1garlic clove115-oz. can cannellini (white kidney) beans, rinsed1\u00bdtsp. kosher salt\u00bctsp. freshly ground black pepperPreparationStep 1Set a mesh sieve over a small bowl.

Scrape into sieve and let drain. Transfer nuts to paper towels to drain further. Finely grate garlic into oil.Step 2Blend beans, salt, pepper, three-fourths of nuts, and \u00bd cup water in a blender until very smooth.

And not to be THAT commenter, but I swapped the garlic for red chile flakes, fried them in hot oil for 30 seconds or so, and that flavored the dip with a little toasty heat. So easy! Alex BeggsBon App\u00e9tit 11/12/2021I wish to respond to the Anonymous 4/11 post. I have found that pine nuts go rancid much more quickly than other nuts. They are both delicate and delicious. How long had those pine nuts been in your cupboard? My instincts tell me they were old and would have tasted awful in any recipe. AnonymousChadds Ford , PA4/25/2021Omg this was SO good! The 1/2 cup water was a tiny bit too much- it made the dip more loose than I wanted.  I also have used this recipe as a pasta sauce, and it was delicious. So easy, fast, delicious, and with minimal ingredients. AnonymousOntario, Canada6/12/2020Not sure what the other reviewers are talking about as this is so delish. It is garicky and nutty and just a great alternative to hummus. To save time, I put the garlic in with the pine nuts. And start with a cold pan with the ingredients to they all warm together. Made this many times and my entire family loves it!AnonymousDC6/12/2020This just tastes bad! \n\nI had some pine nuts and white beans in the cabinet and thought I might give this a try. The result: a dip with a strong acrid, raw garlicky, bitter aftertaste. Disappointed. A waste of time!Anonymous4/11/2020Great smell, but the taste gives up after the first taste. Diced seeded tomato?
