Pro tip: If you sign up for the newsletter, you'll get the scoop before everyone else.Healthyish friends,Two megawatt chefs; one hotly anticipated restaurant; all kinds of delays, snafus, and unexpected moves. Ever since we launched Healthyish, I\u2019ve wanted to run a story like this.For Healthyish\u2019s first digital cover, we headed to Santa Monica, where Gabriela C\u00e1mara and Jessica Koslow have been hard at work opening their Mexican-influenced, seafood-forward restaurant Onda. Writer David Tamarkin followed their progress from June through the restaurant\u2019s opening (last night!), and had this to report:Onda's corn nuts are tossed in lacto-fermented jalape\u00f1o-sauerkraut salt.\nPhoto by Dylan + JeniOnda translates to English as \u201cwave,\u201d and C\u00e1mara and Koslow are quick to say that the name, in part, refers to them being on the same wavelength. But they named the restaurant before the real work began, before they knew how much they could get hung up over a fritto misto. \u201cGabi\u2019s food is elegant and clean and minimal,\u201d Koslow says. \u201cMine can be technical and heavy.\u201dThis is the story of how two distinctive cooking styles\u2014and two equally distinctive personalities\u2014have come together to try to create what Koslow calls \u201ca new food for Los Angeles.\u201d Onda isn\u2019t like Sqirl, Koslow\u2019s defining Silver Lake cafe, nor is it like Contramar, C\u00e1mara\u2019s destination restaurant in Mexico City. So, as Tamarkin asks: \u201cWhat kind of restaurant\u2014and whose kind of restaurant\u2014will Onda be?\u201dIt\u2019s a question that is, of course, impossible to answer on the restaurant\u2019s second day. But in trying, Tamarkin reveals a lot about these two high-powered chefs who\u2019ve built global careers by having uncompromising visions, and the struggle of merging those visions under one very sleek, sun-soaked roof.I hope you\u2019ll read and share.Onda's 120 seat dining room is just a few blocks away from the beach\nPhoto by Dylan + JeniAnd while we\u2019re talking L.A., Healthyish will be there in just a couple weeks for Mercado Sagrado! I\u2019ll be leading a panel called \u201cHow to Feel Good About Feeling Good\u201d with some very exciting guests, and we\u2019ll also be selling some sweet Healthyish and Bon App\u00e9tit merch: pins, t-shirts, and a few swank, limited-edition totes that I can\u2019t wait that I can\u2019t wait to share. Get your tickets and we\u2019ll see you there on November 16th and 17th.Until next week,Amanda ShapiroHealthyish Editor\\Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishessayRead MoreLifestyleRunning a Restaurant Is Hard, Chef Partnerships Are Even Harder.
