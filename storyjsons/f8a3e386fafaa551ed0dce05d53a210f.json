I know, you tried whole wheat flour once, the pie crust came out dry and the banana bread was dense. But that was probably hard red wheat, which is higher in protein and more finicky than spelt. You see, each type of wheat has its own properties and flavor. In the wide world of whole wheat flours, spelt performs the closest to all-purpose white flour while bringing a lot more flavor.\u201cSpelt is perhaps the best-known \u2018ancient\u2019 wheat\u201d Roxana Jullapat writes in her fabulous new cookbook, Mother Grains. In it, she calls spelt a \u201cgateway grain\u201d because it\u2019s easier than other wheats (...elusive einkorn) to find in big grocery stores\u2014Bob\u2019s Red Mill makes one. Jullapat gets hers from her local mill, Grist & Toll. I got mine from a local Ann Arbor hippie co-op, out of a bulk bin. We both store our spelt flour and other whole wheat flours in the fridge, where they\u2019ll last longer. (Long story short: Whole wheat flours, ground up with their outer grain layers, are fresher and prone to going rancid. White flour has been stripped of those outer layers and is more shelf-stable.)Our buddy, spelt flour.\nPhoto by Emma FishmanWhat does it taste like?I made crispy spelt flour chocolate chip cookies this week (recipe from Mother Grains) that had a flavor similar to deeply golden-brown toast. I can\u2019t stop eating them.\u201cSpelt has a little bit of an acidic note, almost yogurt-like,\u201d Jullapat said. \u201cThat acidity can range, in an I'm alive kind of way. It also has a very mineral feel to it. You almost taste a little saltiness, a little bit of iron. I\u2019ve definitely described it as the taste of running through a dusty field.\u201dCan you tell she\u2019s spent a lot of time with spelt? When I baked Jullapat\u2019s blueberry muffins, I tasted a hint of pecan and bran from the spelt flour, subtle but present. It made me realize how neutral and flavorless all-purpose flour is. Boring, even! But was I tasting a lactic, yogurt-like fermented note? A hint of salt? Or am I tasting that because I\u2019m searching for it? I guess you\u2019ll have to bake with it and see for yourself.Is it better for you?Whole wheat flour is made of wheat that\u2019s ground up with its outer layer, a.k.a. the bran, which is where the B vitamins, fatty acids, protein, minerals, and fiber are. Since those layers are removed before white flour is ground, you\u2019re getting more nutrients when you eat whole wheat flour. Are we talking HUGE benefits? Not really. (Try spinach.) It\u2019s a small amount when you get down to the single-cookie serving, but I\u2019ll take my fiber wherever I can get it.How\u2014and what!\u2014to bake with spelt flour\u201cSpelt adds a pleasant grainful flavor\u201d to whatever you\u2019re baking, said Jullapat. \u201cIt\u2019s very compatible with an array of flavors, from blueberries and peaches to brownies. You\u2019ll get very similar results as baking with all-purpose flour but spelt adds more oomph\u2014I want to say body. A little bit more texture, but also a little bit more dimension to your baking.\u201dUse it as a direct 1:1 substitute for all-purpose flour in cakes, muffins, and cookies, as well as fruit desserts like crumbles and crisps. In buns, pretzels, and breads, however, you\u2019ll have to play around, balancing it with all-purpose, to get the right rise and texture because spelt forms less gluten than white flour. It\u2019s not gluten-free, though, which is why it works so well to create a fluffy, tender crumb.If you\u2019re still nervous about going off-recipe with your spelt flour, do like Claire Saffitz does in her spelt croissant recipe in Dessert Person and swap in a small amount of spelt flour, keeping the majority of the recipe AP (say, 25 percent spelt, 75 AP). You might notice a subtle flavor difference (I didn\u2019t), but more likely you\u2019ll just notice the brown flecks, which makes your baked goods look wholesome and rustic. And who\u2019s to say they aren\u2019t?It's better with spelt:Blueberry Spelt MuffinsThe classic blueberry muffin gets a makeover with nutty, whole-grain spelt flour in the batter and the crispy streusel topping.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titFlourBasically BakingSpeltRecipes you want to make.
