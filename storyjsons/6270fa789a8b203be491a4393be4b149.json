This time around: knives.After years of preaching the all-you-need-is-a-chef\u2019s-knife-and-a-paring-knife gospel, I find myself reaching for a petty knife\u2014the red-headed stepchild of the cutlery drawer\u2014more often than either of my old standbys.\u00a0Sure, a 3\" paring knife seems like a natural companion to your chef\u2019s knife. But the 5\" or 6\" petty (a.k.a. utility) knife is nimble enough to accomplish the tasks of a paring knife\u2014peeling potatoes, segmenting citrus, trimming brussels sprouts\u2014and then some. It\u2019s long enough to function as a boning knife, a fillet knife, even a chef\u2019s knife. It\u2019s the champion of the all-around: agile enough to make delicate work of veggies and sturdy enough to bone a chicken. It strikes the perfect balance between power and grace.\u00a0Corey Milligan of NewWest Knife Works says he gives their petty knife to people he doesn\u2019t know that well, since they\u2019re guaranteed to find use for it, no matter how they cook. And with the groovy colored handles and sleek Japanese blade, they're able to spot it from a mile (or a few feet) away.Sharp, huh?Photo by Ted CavanaughNewWest Knife Works 6\" Petty Utility Knife$200 at NewWest Knife WorksMercer Culinary Renaissance 5-Inch Forged Utility Knife$28 at AmazonExplore Bon App\u00e9titGift GuidesGiftsHoliday GiftsKnivesTrendsRecipes you want to make.
