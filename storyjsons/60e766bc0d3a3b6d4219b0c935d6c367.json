But just because it\u2019s comfort food doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t techniques. They\u2019re the same ones that go into every restaurant pasta you\u2019ve ever loved: Salt the boiling water; cook the pasta al dente; create a silky sauce that marries pasta water, Parmesan, olive oil, and butter.Ingredients4 servings12oz. spaghetti or other long pastaKosher salt4garlic cloves, thinly sliced\u00bccup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling3oil-packed anchovy fillets (optional)\u00bctsp. crushed red pepper flakes4Tbsp. unsalted butter, cut into pieces\u00becup finely grated Parmesan, plus more for servingFreshly ground black pepper\u2153cup finely chopped parsley1tsp. finely grated lemon zest1Tbsp. fresh lemon juicePreparationStep 1Cook pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water, stirring occasionally, until very al dente, about 3 minutes less than package directions.Step 2Meanwhile, cook garlic and \u00bc cup oil in a large heavy pot over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until garlic is golden, about 4 minutes.

The anchovies add such a depth of flavor. Great for a quick weeknight meal or when you\u2019re feeling lazy on the weekend. Used gluten free pasta and it still turned out great. JordanDetroit 9/19/2021This is what I call a week night meal! I left out the anchovies because I don't like them, but everything else was delicious. Veronica Montreal4/20/2021This is my new go-to pantry pasta. I didn't have anchovies or any of the standard subs (fish sauce, etc) and didn't miss it at all. Definitely don't hold back on the pasta water, I used about a full cup to bring this silky sauce together. I also used basil instead of parsley and it was great. A highly adaptable and delicious recipe!MadisonNew York, NY11/12/2020More garlic, more anchovies, more red pepper...more delicious! Thanks BA for a weeknight dish that doesn\u2019t feel weeknight-ish! AnonymousOrange, CA8/20/2020Would someone please help me understand what these recipes are with 12 oz of pasta? Maybe it's different in other parts of the world but where I live, in the greater Boston area, pastas are sold in 16 oz increments. and I'm not stupid I know how to fudge the ingredients and make it work but I don't get the 12 oz idea...leo3Boston, MA8/19/2020This recipe nicely translates into pantry pasta for one with a kitchen scale. Makes for a nice alternative to cacio e pepe as an easy weeknight dinner. Anchovies also: yes.monobrownVancouver, BC4/21/2020So so soooo deliciousAnonymousNew York4/11/2020Am about to try this tonight but don't have tinned whole anchovies,  has anyone tried this using anchovy paste?\nAnonymousYellowknife4/6/2020So delicious and easy from ingredients typically found in my kitchen. I\u2019ll be making this time and time again!!Katherine HoltKingston New York3/1/2020It was so good and cool proof! I made this for one so I split everything and even though I'm sure a lot of measurements weren't great, it came out amazing. Thank you so much!JackQ.Idaho1/22/2020Tryna make this for 1 with just 4 oz of pasta. Does reducing all ingredients to 1/3 work?Anonymous6/6/2019This was a super delicious recipe! I may add my parm at the end next time like others suggested since the parm and parsley ended up sticking together, but otherwise I loved how light and bright the flavors were. I'll definitely make it again and see if I can make the parm creamier.Holly AltNew Berlin, WI5/4/2019oops, my bad.  i meant to say this was Pasta alla Puttanesca without tomatoes, capers, olives; with the addition of butter, cheese, lemon.  wish i could edit my original comment.hollis5Vero Beach, FL3/27/2019hey, y'all -- isn't this just a version of Pasta alla Puttanesca without the tomatoes, capers, olives, or lemon, and with the addition of cheese?  if the name origin story is true, then the puttanesca recipe really IS a pantry pasta.  q.e.d.hollis5Vero Beach, FL3/27/2019This recipe is a keeper...my son and I LOVED it!!!AuntmilleIndiana3/7/2019Explore Bon App\u00e9titPastaItalianEuropeanNoodlePasta & NoodlesQuickEasyWeeknight MealsMainVegetarianNut-FreeSaut\u00e9DinnerRecipes you want to make.
