This ain\u2019t no hippy joint with cashews in everything; rather, The Acorn is fine dining that puts plants first.ORDER THE: dishes heartily built around singular ingredients, like the simply titled \u201cmorel\u201d with wild greens, fried cauliflower, pickled morels, saut\u00e9ed morels, and red wine jus, and the beer-battered fried Halloumi, a dish so popular it\u2019s the only one that survives the menu\u2019s seasonal upheavals. Otherwise, consult your server on what\u2019s current and fresh. If you\u2019re new to the West Coast, take advantage of the restaurant\u2019s forest-centric cooking (you\u2019re unlikely to find candied lichen elsewhere) and its truly British Columbian ingredients, like blushy salmonberries and Haida Gwaii kelp.THE VIBE IS: artfully clad 30-somethings in a stylish room with dark-wood detailing. Not particularly kid-friendly, as you might imagine.PRACTICAL STUFF: Open Sunday to Thursday, from 5:30 p.m. to 10 p.m. (bar service until midnight), and Friday to Saturday, from 5:30 p.m. to 11 p.m. (again, with bar service until midnight). Brunch is served Saturday and Sunday, from 10 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. Reservations are available for groups of six to eight guests, otherwise walk-ins are welcome.\u2014Lindsay AndersonSean DavidSean DavidWE ALSO LOVEBurdock & Co.A Mount Pleasant go-to that shows off the best of British Columbia33 Acres BreweryCalifornia meets the Pacific Northwest and the result is this breezy Mount Pleasant breweryDon\u2019t Argue!
