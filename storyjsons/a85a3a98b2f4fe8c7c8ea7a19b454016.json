But up there, it\u2019s kind of everything.By Amiel StanekApril 23, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Chelsie CraigFacebookTwitterEmailThis is Highly Recommend, a column dedicated to our very opinionated editors\u2019 favorite things to eat, drink, and buy.I\u2019m aware that people have all kinds of complicated adult reasons for being loyal to one airline. Apparently there are things called \u201cpoints,\u201d and secret airport waiting rooms with free bananas, and sought-after \u201cupgrades\u201d of some kind or another. Boooooriiiiiiing! For me, it\u2019s about the little things. And it doesn\u2019t get more little than a 60-mL, 3-1-1\u2013approved bottle of margarita mix\u2014which, to be honest, is about 90 percent of the reason I fly Delta.I love drinking on airplanes. It steadies my nerves (I used to be terrified of flying), but more than that, there\u2019s something incredibly novel about engaging in a perfectly normal human activity (enjoying a mixed drink) in what for much of human history was an impossible, unthinkable situation (hurtling across country in a giant metal tube at 30,000 feet). And while I have always been content with a simple gin and soda or the occasional Bloody Mary, the first time I saw Hella Margarita Mix on the Delta in-flight drink menu, I literally gasped. This changes everything! I thought to myself. (Remember: little things.) Because as much as I like a chilly marg, The Sour Family\u2014a whole host of cocktails comprised primarily of liquor, citrus, and sugar\u2014is my forever drink of choice. Armed with a mini-bottle of sweetened lime juice, a whole new world of cocktail possibilities revealed itself to me. Classic daiquiris! Gin sours! And my all-time favorite: The Whiskey Sour. I was in business. (Actually economy, but whatever.)\u201cI\u2019ll have a cup with extra ice, a bourbon, and a margarita mix, please!\u201d This has become my cheerful, self-satisfied refrain when the drink cart comes around. I now know to be patient with the flight attendants. They will first act confused, as though they don\u2019t know about the margarita mix. (It is also possible that I am the only person who ever orders it.) Then they will do a double take when I ask for a mini-bottle of Woodford Reserve. \u201cWait...you want whiskey with the margarita mix?\u201d But I persist. Because combined, these humble ingredients make for pure mile-high pleasure. Gloriously sweet-tart and just the right amount of salty, with the perfect boozy bite, my in-flight whiskey sour is a breath of fresh (albeit, recycled) air\u2014a spot of brightness and liberty in what is otherwise a confined, dehumanizing situation. It\u2019s just a drink, sure. But up there, it\u2019s kind of everything.I\u2019m going to be real: In real life, closer to sea-level, I\u2019m way too much of a snob to buy store-bought sour mix. I\u2019ll squeeze my own citrus and make my own simple syrup, thank you very much. But tucked snugly into seat 27D, bingeing downloaded episodes of Billions on my iPhone and watching the drink cart start to make its way down the aisle, it\u2019s the most special thing I can ask for. And if that doesn\u2019t inspire loyalty, I don\u2019t know what does.Buy It: Hella Margarita Cocktail Mixer 750 mL, $10 at reservebar.com.All products featured on Bonappetit.com are independently selected by our editors.
