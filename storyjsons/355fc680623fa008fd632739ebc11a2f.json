Up next, 'Night School' actress Megalyn Echikunwoke.Social media can be a mind-boggling place with an overabundance of homogenous feeds, meticulously curated with hints of millennial pink and gold-accented marble. So when we stumble on an account that\u2019s full of pics from a person\u2019s real life (like, actual real life), it\u2019s a real breath of fresh air.Actress Megalyn Echikunwoke is that breath of fresh air.Echikunwoke, whose long resume includes roles on hit TV shows House of Lies and Mind Games along with the recently released movie Night School, uses her platform to speak her mind. \u201cI have something to say, I have a point of view, these are my views, and if it means something to you then great, and if not, that's fine also,\u201d she says of her Instagram account. \u201cIf I can say something that has an impact a thing that's important to me, then I'm super happy,\u201d the Echikunwoke says.It\u2019s clear talking to Echikunwoke that she\u2019s extremely thoughtful about everything she does, including her acting work. She equates being an actor to being an anthropologist: \u201cThe people around you are what feed your work. Getting as much as you can from all different kinds of people only adds to your creative arsenal,\u201d she says. We talked to Echikunwoke about how she approaches wellness, travel, and even her beauty routine.My career highlight so far has been\u2026 Playing Claire in Alexi Kaye Campbell\u2019s Apologia. It\u2019s my stage debut, and that has been something I've wanted to do for a long time, so that's really exciting.For me, wellness is\u2026 a very individual thing. I think a way to wellness comes from really listening to your body, understanding how to keep yourself healthy, and, as much as you can, taking preventative measures to support your body. I think doing something that you love is a form of being well.I\u2019m obsessed with\u2026 dancing, especially ballet. Dance is a foundation of my fitness routine. Anywhere I am, I try to make sure I'm as close to a dance studio as possible, and I think I'll probably practice or study ballet until I'm 80 years old. At least, I hope so.I feel my best when I\u2019m\u2026 consuming art, and lots of it. I'm always at the movie theater, I'm always seeing Broadway shows, off Broadway shows, dance performances, concerts\u2014it\u2019s how I feed my soul creatively. It\u2019s very therapeutic, meditative, and healing for me.The only diet I abide by is\u2026 no diet. I hate food bullies, and I hate having to label my diet all the time. I\u2019m not one type of eater\u2014I just eat what makes me feel good. I try to maintain my blood sugar, but thankfully I don't really crave sweets and am totally happy not having dessert.But when I do indulge I go for... coffee. I definitely need a lot of coffee every day. I\u2019ll also indulge in an alcoholic drink every now and again.One thing you probably don\u2019t know about me is\u2026 I love making my own beauty products. I make a body scrub with sugar, because salt can dehydrate your skin. I use a lot of lemons to break down the sugar in the scrub before I add the oil. And I always make sure to travel with the scrubs and masks that I whip up.Growing up in northwest Arizona taught me\u2026 to explore the world. I grew up in a really remote place with a rich, beautiful culture, and I think that had a huge impact on my love of traveling. Also, my mom was really wonderful about making sure that we traveled as much as we could. We didn't have a lot of money, but she always made sure that we got to go somewhere for the summer, or we would go camping. She made the most of it.I\u2019m most comfortable when\u2026 I\u2019m uncomfortable. I like to be figuring stuff out, and I like being lost in a city. That\u2019s also why I love traveling so much.The country I\u2019m dying to explore more is\u2026 Nigeria. There\u2019s so much I want to discover and uncover in Nigeria, and I\u2019m dying to explore more of West Africa.One piece of advice I\u2019d give young people is to\u2026 stay curious. And, ultimately and above all, remain compassionate and try to find compassion for yourself and others.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishCelebritiesPerson of InterestInterviewsRead MoreLifestyleOra Wise Is Building Community Through Food and Finding Joy on the Dance FloorBy Keia MastrianniRecipes you want to make.
