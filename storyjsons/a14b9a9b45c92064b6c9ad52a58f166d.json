Even after going really hard on the bacon bits, shredded cheese, and scallions, I\u2019m inevitably left with a weird amount of leftover plain potato: a boring, sad, superfluous three percent, destined for the compost.The solution to this problem is not to get a smaller russet potato. It\u2019s to get the smallest potatoes you can find. Reframing your potato-related cooking around tiny potatoes rather than big ones\u2014or even big ones cut into small pieces!\u2014will turn all of your favorite tuber dishes into snackable, one-bite, just-enough-potato delights.Also called new potatoes, baby potatoes, C-size potatoes, or creamers, tiny potatoes are some of the cutest things in the produce department. They max out at 1\u00bd inches in diameter (though many are much smaller) and are often sold in netted bags of all one hue or a medley. My personal favorite is the beige, red, and purple assortment, though admittedly this is mostly for aesthetics. Tiny potatoes aren\u2019t just adorable: They also cook quickly and evenly with little to zero knife work on your end\u2014you can dump them straight onto a sheet pan to roast or into a pot of water to boil. And because you\u2019ve got a smaller flesh-to-skin ratio, you get the whole spectrum of potato textures and flavors in every bite.Small potatoes are smashing (\u2026get it?).\nHow should you use your bag of tiny potatoes? In any dish that would benefit from being bite-size in nature. Standing in for chips as the base for sheet pan nachos, for example, or turned into a heap of crispy smashed potatoes. As the titular ingredient in a potato salad with minimal spud prep (keep \u2018em all whole!), or scattered under a roast chicken to catch the schmaltzy bits. I\u2019ve used them in aloo gobi, where the whole potatoes are no bigger than my largest cauliflower florets, and as a simple side under a shower of black pepper and parm. The size makes everything feel more fun, like party food even when it\u2019s for a regular weeknight dinner. For that reason, whenever I can go tiny, I will. (Of course, I stick with full-sized potatoes for peeling, mashing, slicing, or shredding.)With the flavors of potato pierogi in mind, I recently developed a recipe we\u2019re calling Tiny Potatoes with Sour Cream and Onions which makes use of these special, shrunken spuds. Tossed in a garlic powder, sumac, and salt, they\u2019re roasted alongside red onion rounds (use small red onions for maximum cuteness) until they have a flavorful, crisp, wrinkled-skin exterior and creamy, tender middle. Then they\u2019re piled onto a swoosh of sour cream and covered with herbs like dill and chives\u2014less than ten ingredients total to make a side you won\u2019t be able to stop eating. It\u2019s a perfect example of a \u201cstab-and-drag\u201d dish, a categorization I learned from the State Bird Provisions cookbook that refers to foods you must spear with your fork and drag through a sauce before eating. With each drag, you\u2019ll pick up creaminess, freshness, a little bright sumac, and a roasty onion bite, all with a tiny potato to hold everything together. I recommend it as your first foray into baby potato cooking if you\u2019ve never tried the tiny ones before.You can, of course, treat them as you would a full-size russet for teensy mini loaded baked potatoes. Everything, toppings and all, fits in one bite: no uneaten three percent here.Tiny Potatoes with Sour Cream and OnionsThese extra creamy (and extra cute) tiny potatoes are reminiscent of sour cream-slathered potato pierogi, which is a very good thing.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titcookingPotatoRecipes you want to make.
