For the most delicious squid possible, look for small bodies and tentacles (bodies should be about four inches in length and tentacles about two) and pat dry before tossing in the garlic oil.Ingredients4 servings\u2153cup coarsely chopped blanched hazelnuts or almonds2Tbsp. plus \u00bd cup extra-virgin olive oil, dividedKosher salt4large red bell peppers2Tbsp. sherry vinegar or red wine vinegar1tsp. hot smoked Spanish paprika3garlic cloves, divided1\u00bdlb. cleaned squid, bodies and tentacles separated\u00bdsmall red onion, very thinly sliced1cup mint leaves, torn if large\u00bdlemonPreparationStep 1Preheat oven to 350\u00b0. Toast hazelnuts on a rimmed baking sheet, tossing once, until golden brown, 7\u201310 minutes. Let cool, then crush nuts using the side of a chef\u2019s knife or coarsely chop. Transfer to a small bowl. Mix in 2 Tbsp. oil and season with salt. Set aside.Step 2Prepare a grill for high heat and place a wire rack on one side, orienting it perpendicular to grill grate. Place bell peppers directly on grate (not on wire rack) and grill, turning occasionally, until charred all over and flesh is very soft, 8\u201310 minutes.Step 3Transfer bell peppers to a medium bowl and cover tightly with plastic wrap. Let sit 10\u201320 minutes (doing this extends the cooking and softens the skins). Remove skins from peppers and scoop out seeds; discard. Tear or slice peppers into large pieces and place in a clean medium bowl. Add vinegar, paprika, and \u00bc cup oil and finely grate 1 garlic clove into bowl. Season with salt and toss well to coat peppers.Step 4Return grill to high heat. Finely grate remaining 2 garlic cloves into a large bowl; stir in remaining \u00bc cup oil. Pat squid dry, then add to oil mixture; toss well to coat. Working in batches, grill squid on wire rack on grill until marks appear on bodies and tentacles begin to crisp around the edges, 45\u201360 seconds per side. Transfer to a clean large bowl and season with salt.Step 5Place onion and mint in a small bowl. Finely grate zest from lemon half over, then squeeze in juice. Season with salt and toss to combine.Step 6Divide marinated peppers and squid among plates. Spoon hazelnuts over and top with mint salad.How would you rate Garlicky Grilled Squid with Marinated Peppers?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkExplore Bon App\u00e9titSquidShellfishSeafoodBell PepperVegetableGarlicSummerQuickEasyWeeknight MealsMainDairy-FreeGluten-FreeHealthyishGrillingMemorial DayLabor DayDinnerRecipes you want to make.
