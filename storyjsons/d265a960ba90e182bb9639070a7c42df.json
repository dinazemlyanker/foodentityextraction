He shares recipes he's been cooking, restaurants he's been eating at, and more. It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.You cook, you learn\u2014or at least you hope to.I did a bit of both this past Saturday night when Andy Baraghani came over for dinner.The first thing I realized\u2014which I guess I kind of knew but never really thought about\u2014is that if you have friends who love to cook, let them cook. Instead of asking them to bring a random bottle of wine, have them bring the makings of a dish that fits your menu. We all know that the best part of a dinner party is when you\u2019re all hanging out in the kitchen cooking and drinking, so why not lean into that moment?For dinner, I splurged on some beautiful looking lamb chops, while Andy hit up the farmers market for a Greek salad and just-harvested potatoes.About that salad: Just because it\u2019s early October doesn\u2019t mean summer is completely over, even in the Northeast. Andy showed up with a riot of tiny, sweet-as-candy cherry tomatoes, which served as the base of a new-look Greek Salad that he developed for our August issue. No diner-style chopped up iceberg here. Instead a tangle of arugula, sweet red grilled peppers and, yeah, maybe we forgot to add the feta, but I\u2019m not sure we needed it.Want this letter before it hits the website? Sign up for our newsletter!I learned my lesson the hard way when it came to the lamb chops. I bought some beautiful rib chops\u2014you know, the kind that are cut from rack of lamb and are passed around at fancy country club weddings. Whenever I grill these over high heat, in order to get them nice and crispy but still medium-rare on the inside\u2014I inevitably cause a raging inferno due to all that fat on the chops. They basically get incinerated and blackened and all smoky (not in a good way). From now on, I\u2019m either going to be like my mom and crank up my broiler and throw the chops on a sheet pan, top rack, or I\u2019m going to sear them off in a cast iron skillet (no flare ups!), with my hood cranked on high.Finally, those potatoes. Lesson: Why do I not always make crispy, smashed potatoes? Couldn\u2019t be easier. Boil some smallish, thin-skinned potatoes, like Yukon golds, in well-salted water until just tender. Let cool a bit. Then flatten each one on a sheet pan, drizzle with a generous amount of olive, toss and salt, and slide into a 500-degree oven till all crispy and crunchy and gorgeous. You can be fancy like Andy and serve them atop a swoosh of homemade aioli, or get like Molly Baz and whip up a walnut dressing to go on top (watch her do it here). But, honestly, if you give me crispy, salty potatoes with some indoor-cooked lamb chops and a nice salad, I\u2019m all good.
