However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.Unlike glassblowing or dressage, making bread is a hobby that requires little in terms of initial investment. You need flour, you need packaged yeast or a sourdough starter (which you can order, get from a friend, or cultivate on your own), and you need an oven. All other tools are negotiable.But if you\u2019re several loaves in and have decided baking might be more than just a passing COVID-era distraction, it might be time to level up your breadmaking tools. We turned again to our panel of experts\u2014Josey Baker, author of Josey Baker Bread; Amanda Turner, former baker at Odd Duck in Austin; Joy Huang, home baker of Instagram renown; and Claire Saffitz, who needs no further introduction\u2014to find out what equipment, from digital scales to bread knives, they rely on at home.Starter Storage\u201cI feel strongly about our sourdough home: a translucent plastic deli quart container, nothing fancy or special about it. It\u2019s round, which makes stirring easy (no corners), it\u2019s the right depth (a butter knife or chopstick will reach all the way to the bottom for thorough mixing), it\u2019s tapered (no having to reach under a ledge like in a jar), and it\u2019s super accessible and affordable!\u201d \u2014Josey BakerPlastic Quart Containers, 24 Pack$25 at AmazonArtisan Flour\u201cI didn't know how interesting different wheats and grains could be until I worked with our local artisan flour gurus at Barton Springs Mill. I especially recommend their Rouge de Bordeaux flour, which has such a unique flavor and a good amount of protein. When baked it has notes of cinnamon and baking spice, but it works well in savory applications too. They\u2019ve just started shipping straight to consumers, so it\u2019s an awesome opportunity for home cooks to get their hands on flour that typically you would have to buy at a farmers market or specialty purveyor.\u201d \u2014Amanda TurnerRouge de Bordeaux Flour$10 at Barton Springs Mill\u201cI love locally grown, fresh milled whole grain flour the most, but Central Milling is a good mail order option.\u201d \u2014J.B.Organic High Mountain Bread Flour, 5 lb. bag$11 at Central MillingScale\u201cThis scale has a high capacity\u2014up to 20 pounds\u2014and is extremely precise.\u201d \u2014J.B.AvaWeigh 20 lb. Scale$40 at Webstaurant StoreBanneton\u201cAn 8.5-inch banneton is the perfect size for my loaves, which are 985 grams before baking. I recommend getting one with a liner. Without one, you will get those rings of flour on your loaf\u2014which is pretty, but if you\u2019re scoring detailed patterns, a smooth floured surface is preferable.\u201d \u2014Joy HuangForsun 8.5\" Round Banneton$14 $10 at AmazonDusting Wand\u201cThe one unexpected bread making tool I find myself using throughout the process is this little dusting wand from Oxo. It offers a ton of control, so I don\u2019t have flour flying everywhere when I\u2019m dusting a work surface, dough, or banneton.\u201d \u2014Claire SaffitzOxo Baker\u2019s Dusting Wand$10 at OXO$15 at AmazonBench Scraper\u201cI personally like a bench scraper that is on the larger side because it makes cutting through large amounts of dough easier. Some bakers I know even sharpen the edges like you would a knife to make cutting easier.\u201d \u2014A.T.6\" Dough Scraper$6 at AmazonBowl Cover\u201cI use a plastic shower cap\u2014the kind you get from hotels\u2014to cover my bowls and bannetons. It\u2019s easy to slip on and off, and unlike plastic wrap, reusable.\u201d \u2014J.H.Plastic Shower Caps$9 at AmazonLame\u201cI like to score intricate designs into my bread, and I don\u2019t like traditional lames because I feel like I have less control. But I love these UFO lames because it\u2019s like holding the razor blade in your hand\u2014but without danger of cutting yourself.\u201d \u2014J.H.Wire Monkey UFO Lame$28 at Wire Monkey$28 at EtsyRazor Blade\u201cThis is a good brand of double-edged razor blade. At the bakery, we use them on lames/handles, but if you don\u2019t have one at home, I suggest eating a Popsicle, then carving the Popsicle stick to fit the razor.\u201d \u2014J.B.Personna Double Edge Razor Blades$18 $11 at AmazonDecorating Turntable\u201cFor scoring, I use a cake decorating turntable to make it easy to rotate the dough, dental floss to help plot out the center of the loaf and its axis of symmetry, and a wooden skewer to draw with.\u201d \u2014J.H. (See Joy\u2019s technique here.)Wilton Decorating Turntable$9 at TargetCombo Cooker\u201cA combo cooker is sort of like an upside-down Dutch oven\u2014you place your loaf on the preheated skillet and cover it with the domed lid. Lodge\u2019s Cast Iron Combo Cooker is a great and not super expensive option.\u201d \u2014J.B.Lodge Cast Iron Combo Cooker$79 $45 at Amazon$60 at LodgeDutch Oven\u201cThis is the Dutch oven that I use for home baking. It\u2019s hard to beat this quality for the price, and cast iron not only retains heat really well, but will last forever. You could buy a combo cooker especially for bread baking, but if you use parchment to lower your loaf into the pan, any good Dutch oven will do. This is a good one.\u201d \u2014A.T.Lodge 5-Quart Cast Iron Dutch Oven$45 at Amazon$55 at LodgeBaking Steel\u201cInstead of worrying about burning myself by getting my loaf into a Dutch oven, I just slide my dough on parchment paper right onto my Baking Steel and then invert a stockpot over the bread.\u201d \u2014J.H.Baking Steel$119 at Baking SteelBread Knife\u201cThis is the bread knife that I use. I\u2019ve had a lot of different bread knives in my career, but this one was given to me as a gift from a friend about five or six years ago and it\u2019s still razor-sharp! Also, the quality for the price is really great, so I highly recommend it.\u201d \u2014A.T.KORIN Japanese Trading, Corp.Korin Suisin Inox Bread Knife$59 at KorinExplore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingBreadToolsRead MorecultureSo You\u2019ve Started Making Sourdough...By MacKenzie Chung FegancookingA Preferment Is Your Ticket to Baking Better BreadBy Sarah JampelRecipes you want to make.
