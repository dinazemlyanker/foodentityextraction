RequiredEvery day can start with that iconic toast, thanks to this year-long jam subscription.By Aliza AbarbanelNovember 13, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Emma FishmanFacebookTwitterEmailThis is Highly Recommend, a column dedicated to our very opinionated editors\u2019 favorite things to eat, drink, and buy.Even if you\u2019ve never spent a Saturday morning in a scraggly Silver Lake brunch line, you probably can picture Sqirl\u2019s infamous brioche toast. Chef Jessica Koslow\u2019s most recognizable dish is sliced comically thick, with deeply toasted edges peeking out from a blanket of ricotta and two puddles of vibrant jam. Knife and fork definitely required, plus a napkin or three.It\u2019s a truly transcendent toast set apart by Koslow\u2019s handmade preserves, but you don\u2019t need to book a flight to L.A. to get a taste of that crowning jam\u2014just sign up for Sqirl\u2019s jam club. The year-long subscription delivers two jars each month; each a true preservation of California produce that\u2019s surprisingly juicy and never too sweet. Right now, I\u2019m particularly partial to rosy Blenheim apricot and tangy cherry strawberry.These cute jams make for lovely presents, but you should know: This is a gateway gift. I first received a jar of Sqirl jam for Hanukkah a few years ago and blissfully imagined weeks of eating next-level PB&Js for lunch. But after gleefully dolloping jam into Greek yogurt and over ice cream, the jar was empty in a week. (I later learned that my partner was sneaking spoonfuls, which didn\u2019t help matters.) My only course of action? Opt for a year-long subscription, and hope we learn a bit of self-restraint in the process.Buy it: Sqirl Bimonthly Jam Club, $180 for 24 jams at SqirlAll products featured on Bonappetit.com are independently selected by our editors.
