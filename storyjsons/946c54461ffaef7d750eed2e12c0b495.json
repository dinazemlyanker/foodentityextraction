Hemp-dusted chocolate almonds? Okay. Caffeinated granola bars? I\u2019ll stick to cocaine, thanks. But Pasha Delights Tahini Dondurma (\u201cTurkish-style gelato\u201d), passed to me on a tiny sample spoon by a blas\u00e9 employee who\u2019d had a long day, reaaaally did it for me.It was delicious. Even in an air-conditioned convention center, eaten off wax-coated paper, after 157 other samples.The dondurma had a slightly chewy texture that\u2019s what makes it so unique\u2014and fun as hell to eat. Natural thickeners and a high percentage of cream give it that dense, stretchy effect. And it\u2019s extremely creamy. The tahini flavor is prominent and nutty and near-savory. It\u2019d be fantastic with some macerated strawberries on top.Pasha Delights is run by a husband and wife who come from food science backgrounds. They\u2019re based in New Jersey, where they also make a lovely date-rose flavored dondurma along with pistachio, sea salt caramel, and other flavors. And since an online order requires six pints minimum to purchase, you can go wild. Right now, Pasha Delights is new on the market and only sold online, so Whole Foods, Kroger, Albertson\u2019s\u2014listen up!Buy it: Pasha Delights Tahini Dondurma, $10All products featured on Bonappetit.com are independently selected by our editors.
