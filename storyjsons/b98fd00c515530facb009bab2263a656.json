When I was growing up, the moment my grandmother started to cook up a batch on her stove signaled that the festivities were about to begin. I knew that delicious spreads of baked hams, herring prepared in a variety of ways, lutfisk, and gubbro\u0308ra would be landing on the dining room table in no time. Oh, and I was amped to realize that it wouldn\u2019t be long until I\u2019d receive some Christmas presents too.\u201d Packed with cinnamon, cardamom, and ginger, get ready for your entire home to be infused with the scent of the holidays.\u00a0This recipe is adapted from the cookbook \u2018Aquavit and the New Scandinavian Cuisine,\u2019 by Marcus Samuelsson.IngredientsMakes about 1\u00bd quarts2cinnamon sticks, broken into pieces1tsp. cardamom pods1small piece ginger, peeledZest of \u00bd orange6whole cloves\u00bdcup vodka1750-ml bottle dry red wine1cup ruby port or Madeira1cup granulated sugar1Tbsp. vanilla sugar\u00bdblanched whole almonds\u00bdcup dark raisinsPreparationStep 1Crush cinnamon and cardamom in a mortar and pestle (or put them on a cutting board and crush with the bottom of a heavy pot.)

One adjustment: made a sugar syrup at a 2:1 ratio with water, without boiling, to avoid sugar settling in the wine. Dannomanno Summit, NJ1/3/2021Missing the measurement on the almonds. I'm assuming it was supposed to be a half cup?Alex StewartAtlanta, GA1/2/2021Can you add vanilla extract in place of vanilla sugar? If so, how much would you recommend - 1/2 - 1 tsp?Shelby Texas12/8/2020So freaking good. Would make a tiny bit spicier next time. Ims 12/6/2020What is the calories, carbs, fats, etc., of this and any of your recipes? That would be most helpful. Knowing if it is, or can be adapted, Keto friendly, would be very nice. SusieOregon12/4/2020I haven\u2019t had this yet so I won\u2019t rate the recipe. But I love the raisins and nuts at the bottom of the cup. This is exactly how I had gl\u00f6gg in Copenhagen. It\u2019s a nice wine soaked snack to enjoy once you finish your glass.
