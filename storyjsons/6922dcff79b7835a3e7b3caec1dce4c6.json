But the day after the first 2020 presidential debate, even they were feeling the burden of this election season. \u201cI was extremely confused and anxious when I woke up after the debates,\u201d says Deja Riley Izydorczyk, the director of culture for Fit for Us. \u201cI knew right away that I needed to meditate.\u201d \u201cWe noticed people were exhausted, emotionally and physically,\u201d adds Percell Dugger, one of the cofounders. \u201cPeople in the group were so immediately defeated,\u201d remembers cofounder Mary Pryor. \u201cSeeing their fear and trauma, that raised my awareness so I reached out to Color of Change.\u201dPryor had worked with the racial justice and civil rights advocacy nonprofit in the past. She,\u00a0along with\u00a0Dugger, Riley Izydorczyk, and the rest of the Fit for Us team, saw an opportunity to make self-care a priority during this tumultuous election season. Last week, Fit for Us and Color of Change launched the Sanity Plan, a weekly changing lineup of online resources to use this election season, ranging from fitness classes and meditation sessions to guidelines on voting in the midst of COVID and town halls covering topics like psychotherapy and bringing mindfulness to the Black and brown community. It\u2019s free, open to anyone (you can register here), and ongoing for the next couple weeks, possibly even beyond that. The idea is to give participants the mental, emotional, and physical tools to healthily process the ebb and flow of this election as well as integrate into their own lives in a practical and sustainable way.Deja Riley Izydorczyk connects with Percell Dugger for a virtual session.\nVonecia Carswell\u201cIt is so important for Black folks to take good care of ourselves and each other during this election season and beyond. Part of this is taking care of our political power\u2014helping to get out the vote within our families and communities and even volunteering at polling places, if able,\u201d says Rashad Robinson, the president of Color of Change. \u201cEveryone has a role to play, and these fitness professionals are helping to take care of our people\u2014fighting anxiety with exercise and protecting our peace with meditation. As experts in Black voter engagement, we saw this as a clear way to address health and wellness needs of our millions of members. In short, it was a perfect fit.\u201d\u201cWe believe self-care isn\u2019t something you do when it\u2019s convenient, and we don\u2019t think it should be rooted in privilege,\u201d says Dugger. \u201cWe wanted to make sure it\u2019s accessible to our community now, but also something that is evergreen. No matter who wins, people will experience stress and lack of mental health resources.\u201dBelow, members of Fit for Us share specific practices they\u2019re using to navigate this election with wellness in mind. Introduce them into your own life, now and beyond the election.Courtesy of Mary PryorTry a CBD tincture.\u201cPeople are just confounded by everything, from what\u2019s happening in federal courts to voter suppression to these crazy lines to vote. We have to be aware while also being healthy in the process. For me, that is through plant medicine, which can be in the form of THC, herbs and tinctures, flower essence. CBD is really helpful for anxiety. I recommend this CBD tincture, CHILL TONIC from Tonic Vibes, for sleep support; the ashwagandha, lemon balm, and passionflower help with that too. It\u2019s a unique time, and I think people will be leaning on plant medicine during this election and beyond.\u201d \u2013Mary Pryor, cofounder of Cannaclusive and cofounder and adviser of Fit for UsPractice affirming yourself.\u201cMany people initially fear their own voice\u2014there have been studies that people are more inclined to receive inner dialogue when they refer to themselves as \u2018you\u2019 versus \u2018I\u2019. So I created Forced to Flow, four minutes of mantras from me, a chick of color who sounds like your home girl. Right now, I suggest journaling after listening so these mantras aren\u2019t just words but influences on your life. Say the mantra is \u2018my peace is a weapon of mass construction.\u2019 List 10 examples in your life where that affirmation has shown up. By doing this, you are gathering evidence of these words.\u201d \u2013Tracy G., wellness artist, podcast and radio host, and member of Fit for UsMove your body while listening to a special playlist.\u201cMusic has always been very therapeutic for me; it helps me navigate my emotions, thoughts, and movement in general. For the Sanity Plan, I\u2019ve created three themed playlists\u2014inspiration, reflect, and relaxation\u2014so people can wear a mask, go outdoors, and take a walk or run while listening to these playlists. I want to encourage people to move, since being able to move is a privilege, as well as to share exercises that will actually be impactful for people during this election season.\u201d \u2013Percell Dugger, founder of GOODWRK and cofounder and president of Fit for UsCourtesy of Deja Riley IzydorczykStretch first thing in the morning.\u201cI used to overcomplicate my stretches but now find myself doing something simple: focusing on individual parts of my body. I\u2019ll start with a neck release, then roll out my shoulders, and take some chest openers. Then I move my torso and do a side bend. I\u2019ll get into my lower body, doing some lower body circles or hip flexor stretches. Finally I focus on my legs, stretching my hamstrings and calves and rolling around my ankles. Stretching helps me build awareness of my body and sets me in the right direction for my day. I feel more flexible and malleable, especially when I head into stressful situations.\u201d \u2013Deja Riley Izydorczyk, creator of Deja Riley Athletics, host of PopSugar Fitness, and director of culture at Fit for UsMeditate when you\u2019re in the bathroom, washing dishes, everywhere.\u201cI suggest micro meditations. No four-hour session sitting on a mountaintop. That\u2019s what people think meditation is, but when you have a job and a family, that\u2019s too much. You only need a couple minutes to meditate, maybe it\u2019s in the bathroom if that\u2019s the only place you can be alone, or at the sink while you\u2019re washing dishes. Wherever you are, focus on your breath, your sensations, what\u2019s happening around you. Become silent. Say you\u2019re washing dishes, become curious about what you\u2019re doing. What is the sensation of water on your hand? How does the soap feel? What does it smell like? What is that piece of something you can\u2019t get off the plate? How long does it take to get off? This is meditation. You\u2019re not escaping your life for meditation, but integrating meditation into your life.\u201d \u2013Dr. Ally Hicks, Ph.D., mental health and relationship expert and member of Fit for UsSet intentional breaks.\u201cI have a friend who is a Trump supporter. We share our differences, we don\u2019t fight, we don\u2019t argue. The way I\u2019m able to do this is by understanding and loving myself, so I don\u2019t need to react and can listen to the other person. I practice this kind of mindfulness at work by stepping away to a hiding spot. I just talk to myself, whether it\u2019s through a whisper or a thought, reminding myself that I am loved, I am kind, and I am safe. I tell myself this three times. This is to give reassurance to myself. Then I try to find someone in my space, maybe it\u2019s someone at the gym I manage, and I give them a wink or open the door for them. This helps me be in someone else\u2019s awareness, not just stuck in my own world.\u201d \u2013William Robinson, general manager of Blink Fitness in Brooklyn and member of Fit for UsFocus on the immediate, rather than the long-term.\u201cRunning and meditating have both given shape to my days, when my sense of time and space has warped out of control. I strive for consistency and quality in what I do, rather than the high-water marks. I ask myself, Am I going to run today? Did I meditate this morning? If I didn\u2019t meditate this morning, will I do it at night? It\u2019s going back to the simplest acts, which can sound abstract but are very specific and real. Now I think about what I\u2019m going to do today. For the election, we\u2019ll be awaiting results, but the reality is we won\u2019t know until some time after. Instead of getting caught up in that, I can focus on what I am doing on November 4, then November 5, and set intentions for each day.\u201d \u2013Knox Robinson, writer, coach, founder of Black Roses NYC, and adviser to Fit for UsExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishSelf CareInterviewsRead MoreLifestyleA 4-Step Breathing Exercise to Cope With Difficult EmotionsBy The Healthyish TeamRecipes you want to make.
