It\u2019s called umami. Get into it. Rub steak with \u00bc cup oil; season with salt and sprinkle with pepper (it should nearly cover both sides). Let sit at room temperature 30 minutes. For an over-the-top dinner menu, serve with arugula with Italian plums, Romano bean salad, paccheri with shellfish, grilled red mullet, and brioche au rhum. We said over-the-top.Ingredients8 servings21\u00bd\"\u20132\"-thick porterhouse steaks (about 6 lb. total)\u00bdcup extra-virgin olive oil, dividedKosher salt3Tbsp. freshly ground black pepper2garlic cloves, finely grated\u00bccup fish sauce2Tbsp. coarsely chopped marjoram, rosemary, and/or thymePreparationStep 1Rub steak with \u00bc cup oil; season with salt and sprinkle with pepper (it should nearly cover both sides). Let sit at room temperature 30 minutes.Step 2Mix garlic, fish sauce, herbs, and remaining \u00bc cup oil in a small bowl.Step 3Prepare a grill for medium-high indirect heat (for a gas grill, leave one or two burners off; for a charcoal grill, bank coals on one side of grill). Grill steaks over direct heat until nicely charred, about 2 minutes per side. Move steaks over indirect heat and continue grilling, basting with fish sauce mixture, until browned all over, about 5 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of steaks should register 120\u00b0 for rare; temperature will rise to 125\u00b0 (or medium-rare) as they rest. Transfer to a cutting board and let rest 20 minutes before slicing against the grain.How would you rate Grilled Bistecca with Herby Fish Sauce?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkExplore Bon App\u00e9titSteakBeefMeatEasy5 Ingredients or FewerMainDairy-FreeGluten-FreeKetoGrillingDinnerRecipes you want to make.
