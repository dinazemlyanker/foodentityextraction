Trust us\u2014it\u2019s a thing.ORDER THE: only thing on the menu: pillowy gnocchi out of a Chinese take-out container. You can get it tossed in a classic tangy-sweet tomato sauce (our go-to, with a shake of red pepper flakes) or a spicier version\u2014and with a hefty pile of grated Pecorino Romano for an extra dollar. If you love that sauce as much as we do, you can buy a jar at the stand too.THE VIBE IS: inconspicuous. Sandwiched between two popular spots (Fairmount Bagel and ice cream shop Kem CoBa), the tiny window is easy to walk past. Make the most of that prime location and grab a seat at the rainbow-colored bench outside, double-fisting gnocchi and durian ice cream. Don\u2019t worry: The fragrant smell of red sauce overpowers the stinky fruit.PRACTICAL STUFF: Open every day 8 a.m. to 9 p.m. or until sold out.\u2014Alyse WhitneyPhoto by Dominique LafondWE ALSO LOVEDieu du CielChoose your own microbrew adventure in Mile EndSt-Viateur Bagel ShopSettle the great bagel debate by getting a dozen at the famed Mile End mini chainLarrysA natural wine bar that also serves the best breakfast in Mile EndExplore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
