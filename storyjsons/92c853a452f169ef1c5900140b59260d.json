She\u2019s one of the city\u2019s most dynamic  community-centric chefs. The quality and unpredictable nature of Burdock & Co.\u2019s dishes make for a fun and ever-evolving experience.ORDER THE: house-milled arctic sourdough bread with cultured butter to start, then whatever your server recommends off their current menu. The buttermilk fried chicken is one of the few items they keep\u2014and for good reason.THE VIBE IS: a Pacific-Northwest mix of brick, wood, candlelight, and locals. The food may be intricately plated, but it\u2019s also accessible in price, making this an ideal neighborhood spot.PRACTICAL STUFF: Open every day, from 5 p.m. \u2019til the last regular has left; and for brunch on weekends, from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. You can reserve online ahead of time.\u2014Lindsay AndersonJANIS NICOLAYExplore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
