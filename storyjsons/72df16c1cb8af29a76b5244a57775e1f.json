Lard will change from yellow to very white. Continue mixing on medium for about 5 more minutes while you prepare the broth.Step 2In a separate bowl, whisk together broth, baking powder, salt and saz\u00f3n or annatto. Working in batches, slowly pour broth into KitchenAid\u00ae Stand Mixer stainless steel bowl with the whipped shortening or lard and whip until it incorporates into the fat. Do not pour all at once, wait until broth incorporates into shortening/lard before adding more liquid. Mix for about 5 minutes.Step 3Once broth is incorporated, switch out the wire whip for the flat beater attachment. Add corn flour cup by cup into the whipped lard and broth mixture. Continue beating on medium high until the dough is whipped and smooth, about 15 to 20 minutes.To test if your masa is ready, fill a cup of water and drop a tablespoon of the dough into the water. If it floats, the masa is ready. If it sinks to the bottom, then your masa needs more liquid or fat. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and set aside.For the fillingStep 4Boil or bake the chicken until it is cooked through. The chicken is done when a meat thermometer inserted into the center reaches 165 degrees F.\u00a0Place in the cooked chicken into KitchenAid\u00ae Stand Mixer stainless steel bowl. Using the flat beater attachment, shred on low. Alternatively you can used warmed, skinless rotisserie chicken and follow the same shredding process. Set chicken aside.Step 5To prepare the green chile sauce, place tomatillos, chiles, and onion in a large pot and cover with water. Bring to a boil and reduce heat and cook for 20 minutes until soft. Do not over boil and let the tomatillos burst.While the vegetables are boiling, roast peppers until they are charred and blistered. Remove from heat to a bowl and cover with foil. Let sweat for 20 minutes. Once cooled enough, use your hands to remove the charred skin and seeds.Drain boiled vegetables and blend with cilantro, garlic, the roasted peppers, and salt or bouillon until smooth.Step 6In a large saucepan, warm blended green chile sauce over medium heat. Add shredded chicken and simmer for 10 minutes. Remove from heat and allow to cool about 5 to 10 minutesTamale AssemblyStep 7Roll out a 9x9 inch sheet of aluminum foil \u00a0on a flat surface. Take about 2 tablespoons of masa in the center of the foil and, using a putty knife, spread thinly downwards almost to the edge, leaving a border.Put about 1 to 2 tablespoons of the chicken chile filling in a line down the center and add a line of cheese alongside it, leaving some space around the edges. Fold one side of the tamale over itself and press down. Wrap to form a rectangle and seal. Roll up open edges of the foil until tight. Repeat with remaining masa and filling.Step 8Fill the bottom of the pot with a steamer insert with about 2 inches of water that reaches the bottom of the insert.\u00a0Crumple a large sheet of foil to form a 3-inch diameter ball. This will act as the support for the tamales to stand upright. Place the ball in the center of the pot filled with water and lean tamales with the seam side out. Bring water in the pot to boil then reduce heat to medium-low. Cover pot and steam tamales until dough is firm, about 40 to 45 minutes. Add more water if the liquid amount gets low.Step 9To check doneness, remove a tamale from the pot. When cool enough to handle, unwrap: If dough sticks to the wrapper or foil, rewrap and return to the pot to steam for about 5 more minutes.Step 10When done, remove tamales from the pot and let rest for 5 to 10 minutes. To serve, place unwrapped tamales on a plate and drizzle with green chile.How would you rate Chicken & Cheese Tamales with Green Chile Sauce?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkRecipes you want to make.
