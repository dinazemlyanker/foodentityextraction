When something\u2019s so easy to make that you don\u2019t even need one. Welcome to It\u2019s That Simple, a column where we talk you through the process of making the dishes and drinks we can make with our eyes closed.I come from a family that pretty much lives for leftovers. I\u2019m talking about the type of people who can\u2019t let a good meal end. While we\u2019re eating, everyone is already chatting excitedly about the next meal we\u2019re going to make out of the scraps. Whenever we\u2019re having Chinese roast duck, my mom will always make us stop halfway through so she can pick all the meat off the bones and save everything for duck congee (including the bones, which give the stock a rich flavor). The first meal is good, but the leftovers meal is even better.When I\u2019m back in California visiting, my mom always saves a bowl of rice in the fridge from dinner the night before. The next morning we wake up to the sound of rice sizzling and crackling on a hot cast-iron pan and know that she\u2019s making her Chinese fried rice pancakes. To make this dish, Chinese fried rice in pancake form, she uses day-old jasmine rice straight out of the fridge, pours an egg mixture over to bind it, and tops it with Spam, Chinese sausage, and vegetables. The pancake is covered, steamed until it\u2019s creamy and custard-like, and then uncovered and sizzled to golden perfection.If you\u2019ve never seen fried rice pancakes in a restaurant or even heard of them, well, neither have I. From what I can tell, my mom invented this dish out of our love for all things crispy. Annie Yen is a freestyle cook\u2014you\u2019ll never see her use a measuring cup or any kind of timer when she\u2019s in the kitchen. But she\u2019s obsessive about perfecting her technique and will make a dish over and over until she gets it just right.Here\u2019s how she does it:\u00a0First, prep all of your toppings. You can use \u00bd cup diced Spam or ham, 1\u00bd links Chinese sausage (lap cheong), sliced into rounds, \u00bd cup quick-cooking vegetables like bell peppers, corn, carrots, or peas, cut into bite-size pieces, if necessary, and 1 scallion, sliced on a diagonal.Then, make the egg mixture. In a small bowl, whisk together 2 eggs, 2 tablespoons soy sauce, \u00bd cup water, and a pinch of white pepper. This mixture is used as a binder for the rice pancake.Heat 1 tablespoon of grapeseed or other neutral oil in a 10-inch cast-iron or nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add Spam and sausage pieces and cook, stirring often, until golden brown and crispy, about 3\u20134 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, remove the Spam and sausage, and set aside in a bowl. Leave the rendered fat in the skillet for the rice.Turn the heat down to medium. Add 2 cups day-old jasmine rice to the sizzling hot pan and press down with a spatula to form an even layer covering the bottom. Pour the egg mixture over the rice, swirling the pan to coat evenly. Top the rice mixture with the Spam, sausage, and vegetables. Place a lid on top. Cook for about 8\u201310 minutes, until the eggs are custardy and cooked through.\u00a0Take the lid off and keep cooking until the bottom of the rice is crispy and perfectly golden. Use a spatula to gently lift the sides, checking for browning on the underside, which will take about 3\u20134 more minutes. For those who like to live dangerously, try not to touch it at all and wait until you smell the rice beginning to burn, then pull it immediately off the heat. Phew! It\u2019s perfect. This way you know that the Maillard reaction (browning) is in full swing and you\u2019re going to get the maximum crispy crust.Top the pancake off with scallions and let it rest for a few minutes to firm up. When you cut it into wedges for serving, you\u2019ll hear a satisfying crunch from all the crispy rice bits at the bottom.I\u2019ve cooked professionally for over a decade now, writing recipes and styling food in New York. I have spent years perfecting French farm-to-table dishes, traveling to Italy to learn about everything pasta, and chasing down the trendiest grain bowl in L.A. After all of that searching, it\u2019s only now, when everything that\u2019s important to us has risen to the surface, that I\u2019m rediscovering what it means to be Chinese American. The best food I have eaten will always be our family dishes that have no name and no recipes. I\u2019m giving this dish a name now and celebrating my mom\u2019s clever ways of using up leftovers to feed our family.Diana Yen is a food stylist, photographer, and recipe developer in Brooklyn, NY.
