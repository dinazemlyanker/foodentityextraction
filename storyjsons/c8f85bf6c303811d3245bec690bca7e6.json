It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.Happy belated Halloween!There are shrunken heads and then there are rosy cheeked, wrinkly APPLEHEADS. In the 1960s-70s, carving dehydrated apples into dolls was a niche creepy craft. It takes 3-4 weeks to dehydrate an apple into carveable form, and then you dress it up and get weird. People to this day continue to sell them on Etsy (sorry, and watch out for some problematic heads). There are pamphlets that can show you how to do it, like the one below that was lent to me by Nastassia Lopez and Dave Arnold, the cocktail geniuses of Booker and Dax. Nastassia carved applehead cocktail garnishes recently for a party at the Harry Houdini mansion in Laurel Canyon (fitting) and made some more for Halloween. \u201cOnce they\u2019re shrunken they actually look like they have their own personality,\u201d she told me. \u201cPeople will be like \u2018this one looks like Buddy Hackett. This one looks like the night watchman at an animal processing plant. It\u2019s fun.\u201d See?Ahhhh!Want this letter before it hits the website?

But this tiny Brad with his pickle and knife\u2014winner!Photo by Emily SchultzShe went to WegmansEmily Schultz went to college in Wegmans\u2019 hometown of Rochester, New York, which practically means she majored in Wegmans. So when the giant grocer dropped down in Brooklyn this week like the Wizard of Oz house, she went on opening day to investigate and celebrate. \u201cIt was more crowded than Trader Joe\u2019s, but worth it for the Western New York camaraderie,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s really easy to bond over a bad football team and freezing cold winters. I bought the perfectly chewy chocolate chip cookies, but I also LOVE the Wegmans brand radiatore pasta that they call \u201cnugget\u201d pasta. Also they have rotisserie chicken IN A BAG. Their cheese section has over 100 cheeses, and all of the produce was being misted as I walked by so it looked fresh. But Danny [Wegman...the owner], if you\u2019re reading this, we need to talk about putting a sub shop and a better bulk section in this location. I drank a Genny Cream Ale in the parking lot and felt like I was 20 again. All in all, a great day.\u201dShe went to breakfastThis week, Sarah Jampel went to a press breakfast in honor of the new cookbook Poil\u00e2ne: The Secrets of the World-Famous Bread Bakery. The host of the breakfast was Ina Garten! Here\u2019s Sarah\u2019s report: \u201cMy husband used to think that Barefoot Contessa was the name of the host who cooked \u2018in a garten,\u2019 so I was relieved when she stuck out her hand and introduced herself to me as Ina. That cleared things up. I learned that Ms. Contessa bought her Paris pied-\u00e0-terre based on its proximity to Poil\u00e2ne. I spent the majority of the morning fretting over whether to eat my savory pain perdu with my fork in right or left hand (50:50 chance). Before I left, I snapped a photo of a fellow attendee (it was her birthday) and Ina herself. \u2018She makes you feel like you\u2019re the only girl in the world,\u2019 she told me on the subway after.\u201d Thanks Sarah!Unnecessary food meme of the weekPlease keep sending theseUnnecessary food feud of the weekAlex LauBlood oranges: a vampire\u2019s mocktail! In a meeting about an upcoming citrus story, Sarah Jampel had one request: \u201cPlease, no blood oranges.\u201d Tell us how you really feel about them, Sarah! \u201cDisappointing to bite into it! Horrible!\u201d She replied. Kate Fenoglio gasped (made that up, I wasn\u2019t there): \u201cI don\u2019t understand this! Blood oranges are my favorite fruit!\u201d She shared a link to Alison Roman\u2019s beautiful blood orange upside-down cake in hopes of persuading us. Kate has Carla Lalli Music on her side: \u201cLove them! They\u2019re rare and fleeting and special and different. Celebrate the season, citrus has peak moments and this is one of them.\u201d Chris Morocco shrugged, \u201cThey\u2019re good,\u201d and then showed me the swag he got from an Allure giveaway (dry shampoo!). Molly Baz was chopping celery in a sideways formation that made me nervous, saying that blood oranges \u201care for aesthetics only\u2014they just sit pretty. I prefer a Cara Cara.\u201d Andy Baraghani seconded the Cara Cara, adding, \u201cBlood oranges got a reputation for being special and delicious, but they\u2019re not. Color wise, yes, it\u2019s supreme. But to me, they have more seeds. And they\u2019re difficult to peel, not juicy enough\u2014\u201d and then he tore into a turkey wing and all conversation ceased. Brad Leone crossed his arms. \u201cLet me guess\u2014Rapo doesn\u2019t like \u2019em. Well they\u2019re fine, but they\u2019re no grapefruit.\u201d He slapped his hands and carried on his way. \u201cStupid!\u201d concluded Sohla El-Waylly.How do you feel?Explore Bon App\u00e9titBeggs NewsletterHalloweenRead MorecookingRoasting Pumpkin Seeds Is 100% More Fun Than Dressing Up Like A CatBy Aliza AbarbanelcultureSexy Food Costumes, Ranked By SexinessBy Alex BeggscookingThe Halloween Snack You Should Feed Your Kids Before Trick-Or-TreatingBy Carla Lalli MusiccultureAlmond Joy or Almond Despair?By Alex BeggsRecipes you want to make.
