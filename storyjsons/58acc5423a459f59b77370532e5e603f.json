And, sure, if you want a four-hour wait to be part of your experience, go ahead. But I am here to tell you that my experience, which included moist, fall apart-y brisket, black pepper-dotted ribs, and smoky beans was absolutely perfect. And I didn\u2019t have to sacrifice my entire morning standing around on a rainy Austin day to get any of that.But if you are going to go the pre-order route, there are a few key things you need to know in advance. (Considering Franklin BBQ is the kind of legendary spot that you plan an entire trip around, the whole thinking ahead thing shouldn\u2019t be an issue.) First, you have to place your order here at least a week in advance. And, it needs to be a minimum of five pounds of meat. But you\u2019re bringing friends, right? Plus, late-night leftovers are never a bad thing. You then select your pickup time and date, pay a deposit, and you\u2019re set. The day of your pickup, simply walk past all the people standing in the line that wraps around the entire block (the experience, if you will) and head to the food truck in the back. Tell them you\u2019re picking up a pre-order and minutes later you\u2019ll be handed a bag full of smoked meat glory. On my recent visit I went with the brisket, pork spare ribs, sausage, pulled pork, turkey, potato salad, slaw, and pinto beans. We drove quickly (and safely) home, and put out the spread. As expected, it ruled. As we licked our fingers and sat back to admire the wreckage, the most important comment came in, from none other than Austin resident/Bon App\u00e9tit editor at large/part-time Franklin BBQ employee Andrew Knowlton: \u201cPro move,\u201d he wrote.
