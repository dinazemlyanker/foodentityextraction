Would recommend increasing the amount of sugar in the pudding by 1tsp if you have a sweet toothanushkaiyerSingapore 5/6/2020Made this with gluten free ginger snaps and it was delicious.  I cut up the bananas and mango smaller than in the pic and served one slice of the starfruit on top.  I would have served right away though....the cookies got mushy.  Everyone loved it regardless!  carin1Long Beach, CA1/26/2020Am i missing something or does the pudding not have to be brought to a boil ? Mine hasn't set at all after 12 hours.AnonymGERMANY 1/23/2020DELICIOUS! Subbed pears for bananas and shortbread for the tea biscuits. My new go-to for a simple, not too sweet dessert! Our vegan guests loved it. Great base for whatever fruit combinations you can imagine.
