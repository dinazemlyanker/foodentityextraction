The list changes frequently, but keep an eye out for Bella, a natural sparkling wine producer in the Okanagan Valley, and Little Farm Winery in the Similkameen Valley, a single vineyard producer of Chardonnay and Riesling. They also have a small but appealing selection of Scotch. If you\u2019re feeling peckish, snack on the smartly sourced cheese and charcuterie board or belly up for the small seasonally based dinner menu.THE VIBE IS: cramped and cozy, with bottles everywhere and industry vets at the six-seat bar or few tables, which have drawers for cell phones. It\u2019s a subtle reminder to be present and enjoy what\u2019s in your glass.PRACTICAL STUFF: Open Tuesday to Saturday, from 5 p.m. to 11 p.m. (with happy hour between 5 p.m. and 6:30 p.m.). Closed Sunday and Monday. No reservations.\u2014Lindsay AndersonGrant HarderGrant HarderWE ALSO LOVE33 Acres BreweryCalifornia meets the Pacific Northwest and the result is this breezy Mount Pleasant breweryUpstairs at Campagnolo\u201cCamp Upstairs\u201d in Strathcona is the only carpeted dive bar you\u2019ll want to spend time inThe DiamondProhibition-era glam (and meticulously made cocktails) in GastownExplore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
