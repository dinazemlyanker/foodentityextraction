Sure, why not.By Sasha LevineApril 20, 2020FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Chelsie Craig, Food Styling by Pearl JonesFacebookTwitterEmailWe're spending more time in our homes than ever before. In \"There's No Better Time To...\" we'll share the little projects we're finally getting around to. This week: Make breakfast with big weekend energy.As a get-up-and-go sort of gal, my normal mornings look like this: I wake up at 7, head to work by 8, start my (first) cup of coffee by 9, and finish a still-green office banana (thanks, big media corporation!) about thirty seconds later.But these days (yes, you know the ones), I no longer have an office to run to, or a rush hour to beat, or free bananas at my disposal. It\u2019s unmoored me, to say the least. But it\u2019s also given me something in return: a deeper acquaintance with the snooze button\u2014and an appreciation for the Hot Breakfast.Standing over the stove on a Tuesday morning might sound like torture this many weeks into having to feed yourself three (plus) meals a day. But to me it\u2019s been a revelation\u2014and I\u2019ve gone all in.I\u2019m talking pancakes with generous pats of butter. Scones with whipped cream and macerated berries. Toast with poached eggs. Toast with spoon eggs. Toast with lacy, crispy fried eggs. Steel-cut oats (the decidedly not instant kind), loaded with toasted walnuts and brown sugar. Crepes with cottage cheese, all rolled up and drizzled with maple syrup like some sort of soft, sweet flauta. Farina, dashi oats, waffles! I\u2019ve got my eye on fresh-baked breakfast cookies and shakshuka next. Whatever I can eat hot, I want.Part of the allure lies in eating something that will actually get me to lunchtime. It\u2019s also great that picking up a whisk or cracking a couple eggs means that the first thing my hands do each day won\u2019t involve clack-clack-clacking on a keyboard. But most of all, it feels like a luxury, like a rebellion. In the Before Times, the most important meal of the day was about efficiency. Now, it\u2019s a way to steal back a little of my day before facing the responsibilities awaiting me at my desk.Everyday feels like Groundhog Day, but this new nourishing routine is keeping me sane and occupied. I can have something different for breakfast every morning, no green-ish bananas allowed.And that alone is worth getting out of bed for.Explore Bon App\u00e9titCoronavirusBasicallyThere's No Better Time Recipes you want to make.
