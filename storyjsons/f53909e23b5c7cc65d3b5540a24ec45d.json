Sometimes called a Chinese rolling pin, it\u2019s like a regular rolling pin but shorter and thinner. While I was in Hong Kong a few years ago, I wandered into a restaurant supply store and came across a display of mini rollers, ranging in width, length, and shape, everything from thin dowels to ones with tapered ends. I picked out a few to bring home and try.I learned then what I wished I had learned years before. A shorter and thinner rolling pin makes a huge difference. The main improvement was in the handling\u2014it gave me so much more control over rolling than an unwieldy large rolling pin and made it easier to maneuver with one hand, freeing the other hand to turn the dough. I was able to produce dumpling wrappers that were the round, thin shape I wanted as well as thinner on the edges than the middle.The dowel in action!\nDumpling rolling pins are usually about 9\u201312 inches long, in varying widths. The thinnest one I own is only \u00bd-inch in diameter, but my favorite is 1-inch thick and 9 inches long. The width you choose may depend on the size of your hands and what feels most comfortable to you. To start, I recommend a 1-inch diameter roller that is around 10 inches long.These small rolling pins can be purchased at Asian kitchenware stores and online, but if you are looking for a less expensive alternative, a simple dowel from the hardware store would work well too. Look for a round dowel that is about \u00be\u20131\" thick and ask them to cut it to 10 inches long. Make sure you sand and oil them before first use.Photo by Isa ZapataThin Wooden Dowel$11 at AmazonOnce you have your small rolling pin, it can also be used for other projects that require working with small pieces of dough. I also use mine for rolling dough for char siu bao, mochi, tortillas, empanadas, and hand pies. Outside of dough, small rolling pins can do double-time as a muddler, as it\u2019s the perfect size and shape to crush fruit and herbs for cocktails. I also use mine to smash things up in the kitchen, like graham crackers for pie crust or ice.Arguably the most essential tool in your dumpling-making arsenal, a smaller rolling pin will make a big difference in improving your wrapper rolling skills\u2014it did for me.Roll with it:Pea and Ricotta Potstickers With Homemade Dumpling WrappersMaking fresh dumpling wrappers isn't hard when you have Hetty McKinnon to guide you.
