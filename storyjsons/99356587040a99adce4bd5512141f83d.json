Why are we eating like it\u2019s the end times?By Alex BeggsJanuary 27, 2020FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Laura Murray, Styling by Allie WistFacebookTwitterEmailThe other day I was exiting the New York City subway and a woman made direct eye contact with me and said: \u201cJesus is coming.\u201d And, sensing I\u2019d heard that one before, added: \u201cVery soon.\u201dLike, this week? I wondered. Because if so, I need to get my snacks in order.I know exactly what to buy, because I\u2019m a trade show-attending, grocery store newsletter\u2013subscribing, avid snack news\u2013following kind of person. I try every new product at Trader Joe\u2019s even though it hurts sometimes. I spend the kind of time perusing the chip selection at Kroger that I do in the hallowed aisles of Sephora. Study, devotion, curiosity. And I can\u2019t help but notice, for the past few years now, that snacks have gotten more...apocalyptic.What I mean is: they\u2019re unnecessarily nutrient-packed and efficient. Vitamins, yeah. And So. Much. Protein. They\u2019re dehydrated and shelf stable for probably centuries if we last that long. They\u2019re blended into liquid and mush form, requiring no chewing (in case our teeth fall out in the blast?). They\u2019re condensed into bars and turd-like energy \u201crolls\u201d to fit into our pockets when we\u2019re forced to roam in the aftermath of the incoming alien invasion and/or alien war. Jesus might be coming (back). Aliens are always in the cards. Nuclear War, imminent. Unstoppable natural disasters loom. Or maybe it\u2019ll just be us, ruining everything with our boring daily activities, like driving.Either we\u2019re preparing for the apocalypse, or these snacks are simply reflective of how we spend most of our time: working. We work as furiously as the mice used in all of those studies about the workplace. We measure our productivity in real-time data and pride ourselves on the ability to Slack while on a conference call while watching Twitter scroll by. It\u2019s an endurance sport that you never stop adding miles to. And so we need to be fueled. Fast. These efficiency snacks are brainwashing us into thinking we\u2019re busier than we are, thirsty marketing targeted at our increasingly overworked, underpaid, stressed labor force. Will you, bigtime busy person, die without a superfood smoothie pouch? Maybe!All the food groups: jerkies, pouches, dissolvables.\nPhoto by Laura Murray, Styling by Allie WistHere are some of the snacks of which I speak:The pouches. Every toddler in my life is walking around with a mango yogurt pouch wagging out of their mouths like an extra long plastic tongue. Now there are pouches for adults\u2014which is great for those whose physical needs require it\u2014but they\u2019re overtly marketed to adventurers. Like pouches of oatmeal to take camping or to the cubicle you practically camp at, or these peanut butter pouches, pouches of superfood smoothies, pouches of protein smoothies, and squeezable chia pouches.Don\u2019t tell me my life is as on-the-go as a toddler\u2019s. It\u2019s not! I\u2019ve already figured out how to walk, therefore I can spend the rest of my days sitting. After the apocalypse, I\u2019m foretelling, we\u2019ll revert to baby form. We\u2019ll squeeze protein into our weary mouths and dance in diapers made of recycled pouch plastic and howl at the moon who\u2019s no longer accepting new tenants. But until then, I\u2019m gonna eat oatmeal out of a bowl.In the chewables, there are individually wrapped cookies promising to provide enough protein for a powerlifter. Millions of bars, in general, each with their own con, like these lady-specific, dreaming-about-donut-flavored ones that will make future us mourn for donuts when this is all we have left. There are dissolve-in-your-adult-toothed-mouth brussels sprout puffs, because we\u2019ll have to get our greens in when the ground\u2019s all burnt up. There are dehydrated cubes of cheese\u2014Moon Cheese\u2014that our compatriots, the little lab mice, would recognize and adore. Those are pretty good.In the challenging chewables, there are a myriad of jerkys to bulk you up while you order solar powered generators online. There\u2019s salmon jerky that makes you beautiful and gives you cat treat breath. Chipotle soy jerky. Something\u2019s-off vegan jackfruit jerky. Jerky turkey sticks. Buffalo bites with cranberry. \u201cBeef thins.\u201d Dehydrated bison bites with chia. Slabs of pineapple jerky. Zesty Thai mushroom jerky. The bougie healthy office workers who hike on the weekends don\u2019t need this protein, and yet, we can\u2019t get enough of it. It signals efficiency. Protein = strength. Strength = wrists that can withstand 12 hours of straight typing, clicking, thumbing.The apocalypse snacks repulse me and then they pull me in. The zesty Thai mushroom jerky was just what I needed to avoid writing this paragraph five minutes ago. I didn\u2019t have to cook it, which is a small joy. An instant hazelnut oatmeal cup was easy to pour boiling water into and wait three minutes for. Cheese snacks will always be cheese snacks; no matter how close to the moon they are, I will eat them.Survival foods know a secret buried shallowly inside me. They know that I want someone, something to take care of me once in a while, like an $8 snack crammed with protein and an ad agency design deck. Food that promises to take care of the exhaustion of living might seem like a welcome relief, but eventually I\u2019ll be hungry again. Instead, I want my apocalypse food to be frozen quarts of bean soup I spent three hours making on a Sunday. (The generator will keep it cold.) I\u2019m betting the lady on the subway stairs was wrong. We\u2019ve got some time yet. Time to cook oatmeal and cookies and pork chops. And wait it out.Recipes you want to make.
