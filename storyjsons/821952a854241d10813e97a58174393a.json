We asked 80 of the most interesting people we know to reveal the local spots they love the most.Maggie Flores starts her shift at Joe\u2019s Bakery at 5:15 in the morning.She makes coffee two pounds at a time and pours the first cup for one of the cooks. Four creams and one Sweet \u2019N Low. The kitchen\u2019s grilling bacon, lining up tortillas, getting ready for the doors to open. Nobody speaks. It\u2019s a ritual silence, lost in routine.The first ticket chatters at 5:57. Game time.To tell the story of Joe\u2019s Bakery in Austin is to tell the story of Maggie Flores. The bakery opened 56 years ago. She\u2019s been waiting tables there for 48 of those years. Both are woven into the fabric of their East Austin neighborhood, bound together by hot coffee, breakfast tacos, and pan dulce.For now, being a neighborhood icon comes down to filling salsa cups. Flores transfers gallon jars of jalape\u00f1o verde into plastic thimbles with snap-on lids for carryout orders.For Regina Estrada, the granddaughter of founders Joe and Paula Avila, the salsa ritual framed her introduction to Flores. She was maybe seven or eight. Flores remembers, too. \u201cI would just tell her, \u2018Be very careful, baby girl, with your hands. And don\u2019t touch your eyes.\u2019\u201dA serious breakfast spread.\nPHOTO BY MATTHEW JOHNSONCome 10 a.m., it\u2019s crowded at the kitchen pass. There\u2019s tension, a competition to grab plates first and fast. When you depend on tips to make a realistic wage, that\u2019s the way of things. But there\u2019s also dancing, little hip checks when disco hits the jukebox. \u201cLast Dance,\u201d then \u201cWe Are Family.\u201dFlores weaves her way to the dining room, laden with two hot plates on one arm, a tortilla warmer and a taco plate on the other. All of her tables are full.  She can juggle three coffee cups at a time, on saucers, filling them one over the other with a deft sleight of hand at the industrial urn, never turning off the spigot.\u201cI can tell by the way they hold the cup if they need more coffee,\u201d she says. \u201cThey say, \u2018Oh, Miss Maggie, you read my mind.\u2019\u201dFlores works the ordering terminal like a pro, but she\u2019s more at ease writing orders on a pad. Her elegant print has a decided 20-degree tilt, like words spoken in italics for emphasis.Come on in.\nPHOTO BY MATTHEW JOHNSON\u201cHe didn\u2019t have to ask me twice\u201dEast Austin is a place on a map, but it\u2019s also a charged code phrase for \u201cthe other side of town,\u201d a cultural and economic divide sharpened by the building of Interstate 35 through Austin half a century ago.The Avilas opened Joe\u2019s Bakery on East Seventh Street the same year the interstate was dedicated, in 1962. Just in time, you might say, to give East Austin a place to call its own.\u201cWhen the restaurant was really coming in, in the \u201960s and \u201970s and even the \u201980s, that was during the time Austin was the most segregated, the most divided,\u201d Estrada says. \u201cIt truly was a place that belonged to the neighborhood and to people of color.\u201dThe Flores era at Joe\u2019s began in the mid-1960s\u2014nobody\u2019s sure of the exact year. That\u2019s when the late Joe Avila hired her. She was 17 or 18 at the time, working for a cross-town rival called La Ronda.\u201cShe was a good waitress,\u201d says Avila\u2019s wife and cofounder, Paula. \u201cSome of these waitresses now, they have to run all over the place. But she was always real calm.\u201dFlores left Joe\u2019s and went back to La Ronda for a few years. But Joe Avila couldn\u2019t let the story end there, according to his daughter Rose Ann Maciel. He went to steal her back.Imitating Joe Avila in big stentorian tones, Flores recalled him saying, \u201cMaggie, are you ready to come back with me?\u201d Ready to trade her night shifts for the gentler morning routine at Joe\u2019s, her decision wasn\u2019t that tough, really.  \u201cHe didn\u2019t have to ask me twice.\u201dEven as the neighborhood around Joe\u2019s has changed\u2014it\u2019s on the eastern edge of an expanding gentrification curve\u2014the underlying creed has not.\u201cEverybody\u2019s been welcome at my bakery all the time,\u201d Paula Avila says. \u201cAnybody, any color.\u201dFlores makes coffee two pounds at a time.\nPHOTO BY MATTHEW JOHNSON\u201cThey sit wherever. But they ask for me\u201dIt\u2019s a breezy weekday morning in the 60s, but Joe\u2019s Bakery is filled with the hot noise of people. By 10:30 the wait for tables is four parties deep.For Flores, it\u2019s just another shift. And before it\u2019s over, more than 75 people will rotate through her world, and she through theirs.\u201cThey sit wherever. But they ask for me,\u201d she says.She can\u2019t\u2014or won\u2019t\u2014single out her most famous customer. But the parade of dignitaries has included farm labor activist Cesar Chavez and legendary University of Texas football coach Darrell Royal. Not to mention politicians, athletes, and musicians.\u201cTo me, they\u2019re all favorites,\u201d Flores says.Former Texas state senator Gonzalo Barrientos walks in, still a striking figure at 76. The lion of East Austin politics for ten years in the Texas House and 21 in the state Senate, he sums up Flores in three words: \u201cFamily, stability, smile.\u201d\u201cThe more you get to know somebody, the more you feel like family,\u201d Barrientos says. \u201cThat\u2019s her.\u201dRaymond Lim\u00f3n, 70, comes in with his daughter, Michelle Chavez. His daughter\u2019s been coming to Joe\u2019s since she was ten. She\u2019s 43 now, working through a big bowl of caldo.\u201cShe knows what we want before we even sit down,\u201d Chavez says of Flores.Tom Hatch has been a regular since 1972. The man who sometimes rides his bike here at age 73 is a world-class architect who designed the first wave of Whole Foods Markets.Flores and the staff treat him like royalty. Because, as it turns out, he crafted the 50th-birthday redesign of Joe\u2019s Bakery a few years back that included counter seating up front.Next to Hatch is Orangerine Barrs, a convivial man of 80 in a sharp windbreaker. He\u2019s a Flores fan. \u201cShe\u2019s got a personality that\u2019ll grab you,\u201d he says. \u201cNo matter who you are, no matter your color. It\u2019s all the same.\u201dBenny Perez has been a customer since 1971, the year he danced with Flores at a club called the Latin Quarter. \u201cI\u2019m the one who flirts with her,\u201d says the 66-year-old City of Austin mechanic. No matter how busy the restaurant gets, he\u2019ll wait for a table in her section.This isn\u2019t a part-time hobby for a bored retiree. This is Flores on her feet five days a week from dawn through lunch rush. At 69 she\u2019s as much a working waiter as any 20-something with farm-to-table tattoos. It\u2019s been a busy shift, but she won\u2019t talk about the day\u2019s take. \u201cI do okay,\u201d she says.It took knee surgery after a fall in 2011 to slow her down, but even that was only a few months. Day to day, her restorative secret is a power nap after her shift ends around 2 or 3.Well, that. And a cold Miller Lite. In a can, if you please.Flores chatting with customers.\nPHOTO BY MATTHEW JOHNSON\u201c15 percent of forever\u201dFlores was married, but that was years ago, and her two grown sons live in Austin. She has five grandchildren, including an eight-year-old granddaughter who staged a practice interview for this story.She asked: \u201cMaggie, how long have you worked at Joe\u2019s? And how old are you now?\u201d Kid has a future. Those are the first two questions any reporter would ask.Flores will turn 70 on October 1, with no plans to hang up her apron.\u201cI\u2019m going to stay there until Regina or Rose Ann tells me, \u2018Okay, Maggie, that\u2019s it. You can do it no more,\u2019\u201d she says.A 2007 newspaper article about Flores and other career Austin waiters hangs above one of her tables. She does a happy dance when new customers see it. \u201c15 percent of forever,\u201d the headline says.That\u2019s about how long Maggie Flores has been part of Joe\u2019s Bakery.Mike Sutter is the restaurant critic for the San Antonio Express-News and editor of the website FedManWalking.com.
