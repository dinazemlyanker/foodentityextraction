Now learn how to use the fresh stuff.By Emma WartzmanJuly 9, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Chelsie Craig, Food Styling by Pearl JonesFacebookTwitterEmailMaybe you've only encountered oregano as the fish food-y flakes you sprinkle on pizza. And while it is, indeed, an important slice shop staple, it can\u2014and should\u2014be used for so much more. The dried stuff certainly has its place (pizza, yes, and also dry rubs, vinaigrettes, and sauces, too), but fresh oregano is even more powerful and versatile. (BTW, we\u2019re talking about Mediterranean oregano here, be it Italian, Turkish, or Greek. Mexican oregano shares similar flavors but belongs to a different family.)While oregano is largely considered a \u201chardy herb\u201d (akin to rosemary and thyme), it actually straddles the line between hardy and tender. It doesn\u2019t just belong to one camp. The stems are thick enough that branches will hold together when cooked, even through long braises or simmers. Where cilantro, dill, or basil will turn brown and wilt away to virtually nothing when introduced to heat, oregano holds its form. Yet the leaves, while more substantial than silky, are still delicate enough that eating them doesn\u2019t feel like an unpleasant jaw exercise. This is unlike rosemary or sage, which are pretty unpleasant without some heat from the oven or the stove or a really, really fine chop.This white pesto gets its kick from finely chopped fresh oregano.\nPhoto by Chelsie Craig, Food Styling by Kate BuckensThe taste of oregano also plays both sides. The fresh leaves are peppery and assertive\u2014sometimes even bitter or astringent. They enliven whatever they're scattered over, be it a savory melon salad, or a piece of fish\u2014and a little goes a long way. But when cooked, its flavor mellows so that it's earthy but not aggressively woodsy. It\u2019s powerful enough to hold its own in dishes with bold flavors, like smoky grilled chicken or slow-roasted bell peppers.These One-Pan Chicken Thighs with Burst Tomatoes, Harissa, and Feta take advantage of its two sides. You throw a whole sprig of oregano into a cast-iron skillet with chicken thighs so that the piney flavor can seep into the chicken fat, infusing the meat and the bursting cherry tomatoes. Then you discard the limp remains, plate the chicken, and scatter some fresh leaves on top for fresher, sharper flavor.You can even play around with using both, a practice endorsed by senior food editor Molly Baz. \u201cIf you see a recipe that calls for dried oregano, try cutting it with some fresh leaves, too\u201d she says. \u201cIn a Greek salad? Delicious! Chopped up with the parsley garnish on Pork Marbella? Why not!\u201d Mixed into this classic Italian dressing? Have at it!\u201d Just remember that the fresh leaves are way more potent than the dried stuff, so tread lightly.Next up: Sprinkling fresh and dried oregano on a slice of pizza. Now that\u2019s fine-dining.Go go oregano:One-Pan Chicken Thighs with Burst Tomatoes, Harissa, and FetaThis recipe requires you to chop a grand total of zero vegetables. What's the shortcut? Harissa, a North African pepper sauce that brings the flavor (so you don't have to).View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titOreganoherbRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
