See our past recommendations here!I've never really found a place in my life for jam. I prefer my toast with salted butter and a soft-boiled egg, and I'll take a PB&B (that's banana) over a PB&J any day. It's not that I don't have a sweet tooth; it's just that I prefer my fruit in its pure and un-jammified form.The one exception to this rule is citrus. Because, come on, I'm not about to layer whole lemon slices into my sandwich or on top of toast. That's why BRINS Lemon Saffron Marmalade is the one jam that's found a place on my fridge's condiment shelf. This perfectly sweet, ever-so-slightly salty, mouth-puckeringly tart marmalade works great on toast\u2014and on warm, buttered blueberry muffins, on stacks of pancakes with a scoop of Greek yogurt, or even between two defrosted waffles, eaten like a sandwich while I'm running out the door.In case you didn't know (I didn't), marmalade is just jam made with citrus fruits, traditionally bitter orange. The only ingredients in BRINS' version are lemon, cane sugar, pectin, sea salt, and saffron\u2014and at 8 grams per tablespoon, there's less sugar than your average store-bought jam.BRINS, a Cajun-French word meaning \"little bit,\" is a small-batch jam company founded by architect-turned-jammaker Candace Ross. Her unique blends combine ingredients like strawberry and lemongrass, grapefruit and rosemary, and cherry and chai, inspired by her travels through Asia, Europe, and the Middle East.I want to try adding a scoop of the lemon saffron to a marinade for pork or lamb, or stirring it into a whiskey-based cocktail. I'm still no jam person, but there's definitely room for this marmalade in my life.  \u2014Amanda Shapiro, Healthyish editorBuy it: Brins Saffron Marmalade, $15.All products featured on Healthyish are independently selected by our editors.
