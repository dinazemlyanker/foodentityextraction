At least it is here in the northeast, where it\u2019s not uncommon for us to get snow the first week of April.So, when my friends Mike and Missy from D.C. texted last week, saying they\u2019d be in town Saturday night and would we want to get dinner, my mind went to short ribs, a cold-weather favorite that few dinner guests can resist.But I didn\u2019t want to do the same, reliable version I always make; I wanted to try something different. I wanted the Red Wine and Soy\u2013Braised Short Ribs on the cover of the March issue of Bon App\u00e9tit.Chef Sohui Kim developed the recipe, riffing on a version she serves at her Brooklyn restaurant The Good Fork. The braising technique is familiar to any home cook\u2014sear the meat, sweat some aromatics, add liquid, see you in three hours.The flavor profile sings of Kim\u2019s Korean-American childhood, of soy and mirin and ginger and garlic. The method itself doesn\u2019t stray too far from my usual recipe, but the flavors got me to think differently about what I wanted to pair with it.Photo by Alex Lau, Food Styling by Susie Theodorou, Prop Styling by Ayesha PatelI leaned toward a much more banchan-like approach to sides\u2014crisp, bracing vegetable dishes that would complement the richness of the braised beef.Flicking around our site, I immediately targeted the Crunchy Gochujang Fennel. I love fennel, and I couldn\u2019t resist the notion of it slicked with Korean hot chile paste and spiked with ginger, garlic, and toasted sesame seeds.The other day I was watching Samin Nosrat on Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat chop and salt cucumbers to serve alongside her version of soy-braised short ribs, and it got me thinking of our cucumber and celery Tiger Salad, a recurring favorite of mine.Staying within that same flavor family, but wanting something hot, I picked up some beautiful baby bok choy at the market. Just before I brought the ribs to the table, I simply saut\u00e9ed the bok choy, adding a splash of water to help the vegetables steam while cooking.Alex LauFinally, short-grain white rice, which I somehow almost always screw up. I either make it too mushy or too al dente or too...whatever. This time, I somewhat successfully followed our advice for a pot of perfect steamed rice, but I think I just need to admit that it\u2019s time to invest in a Zojirushi rice cooker.Oh, one last thing about the short ribs. If you have time, make them a day\u2014or at least several hours\u2014in advance. You\u2019ll want to be able to skim most of the fat from the pot, which is a lot easier to do once it has cooled.Don\u2019t worry, the ribs will still be plenty rich enough\u2014no matter what season it is.Get the recipes:Red Wine and Soy\u2013Braised Short RibsCrunchy Gochujang FennelTiger SaladGarlicky Bok ChoySteamed Japanese RiceExplore Bon App\u00e9titAdam NewsletterRead MorerestaurantsGjusta Is My Quintessential, Never-Miss L.A.
