New advisories around decreased restaurant capacity have driven many businesses around the country to close, and beginning tonight, Nom Wah Tea Parlor in New York City has decided to shut its doors temporarily. The restaurant\u2019s owner Wilson Tang tells us that this was not an easy decision and that he appreciates all the support he and the restaurant have received in response to this article since it was first posted earlier this month.About a month ago, a friend sent a group text: \u201cAnyone free for lunch tomorrow at Nom Wah? Would love to support Wilson\u2019s business while his sales have been down.\u201d Wilson is Wilson Tang, the owner of Nom Wah Tea Parlor, the iconic dim sum joint in Manhattan\u2019s Chinatown, and my neighbor in the Financial District. In the wake of coronavirus (COVID-19), New Yorkers are still taking the subways and working in big office buildings\u2014yet many have chosen to avoid Chinatowns in Brooklyn, Queens, and Manhattan. Like many Chinese businesses across the country, Nom Wah has suffered since the news of the outbreak. In response, Wilson has been broadcasting the effects of this news on his Instagram, showing his guaranteed-line-outside business now empty and championing his neighbors with posts of his meals captioned with #supportchinatown. Yesterday, I hopped on the phone with Wilson to talk about coronavirus, its implications for his business and his community, and how he\u2019s moving forward. \u2014Elyse InamineI don\u2019t even know where to start. Earlier this week, the New York Times came out with an article [about the first coronavirus case in New York state] that used an image of Nom Wah as the lead photo. People assumed that the case had to do with the restaurant, that the person who started coronavirus lived above us. That misinformation traveled quickly around Weibo and WeChat. My DMs and Facebook messages were filled with this nonsense. Everyone on the block was talking about it. We emailed, texted, tweeted at multiple people at the Times to take the photo down. It\u2019s gone now, but if you search \u201cNom Wah\u201d and \u201ccoronavirus,\u201d that photo still comes up. That hurts my business.Just like any other person, I\u2019m reading the news, listening, and doing my thing. I don\u2019t get caught up in the frenzy and try to stay positive. But we did start monitoring our sales once news of coronavirus came out. We typically take a decline after Lunar New Year. But this decline was sharper. Month to month, week to week, we\u2019re down about 40 percent in sales. It\u2019s one of the slowest quarters we\u2019ve had in a long time. Chinese people aren\u2019t going out to eat. They\u2019re staying home. They\u2019re worried.That doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re a ghost town. On weekends, that means you\u2019re not waiting in a line for an hour; you can just walk right in. On weekdays, we\u2019re full for lunch, but we\u2019re just doing one turn, not two or three. That\u2019s because, for better or for worse, our restaurant [clientele] is diverse. It\u2019s funny because I\u2019m often told that I\u2019m not authentic enough because I cater to white people. At this moment, I\u2019m like, thank god we have a diverse clientele because it\u2019s white, Black, and Latino people who are coming.Nom Wah\u2019s home on Doyers Street, in Manhattan\u2019s Chinatown.\nPhoto by Laura MurrayXenophobia is a real thing. I feel it. I feel those weird moments, like a few days ago when I dropped off my kids for their gymnastics class. I got extra stares, as if I don\u2019t get them already, being a six-foot-five Asian guy. But the Sinophobia stuff\u2014the fear of Chinese people specifically\u2014is worse. And right now, it\u2019s Chinese people being afraid of other Chinese people. And that\u2019s really hard.A lot of my cooks are older and we have this relationship, where they can come to the States to work for 10 months, then take two months off in China. That\u2019s the shift they do. Now they can\u2019t go home, and there is a sentiment of negativity among them because they know there is hardship there.I\u2019ve been using #supportchinatown, which was created by the Chinatown Business Improvement District, and doing my part as a community leader to squash the fear. If I can eat in Chinatown, so can you. But there\u2019s only so much I can do as one person. I\u2019m just trying to get people on the bandwagon. The businesses that are suffering the most are the mom-and-pop spots in Flushing and Sunset Park\u2014not my restaurant.Our doors are open until an authority tells us otherwise. We\u2019re taking the proper cautionary steps\u2014reminding our staff about thorough hand washing procedures, putting hand sanitizer at the counter for customers, constantly wiping down all surfaces (bathroom faucets, door handles, etc.) with bleach. We let out our staff early because things are slow. We\u2019re focusing on what we need to do. I\u2019m still optimistic. There is no way to be proactive in this way\u2014only reactive. But I\u2019m not going to stop my life. For us, it\u2019s business as usual.Explore Bon App\u00e9titRestaurantsChineseNew YorkFirst PersonCoronavirusRecipes you want to make.
