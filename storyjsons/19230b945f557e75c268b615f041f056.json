Right this way...By The Bon App\u00e9tit Test KitchenMarch 27, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Chelsie Craig, Food Styling by Yekaterina BoytsovaFacebookTwitterEmailWhen we published our Japanese milk bread recipe earlier this month, our Test Kitchen worked with Alessandra Gordon, owner of Seattle-based purveyor Ayako & Family, to create a simpler version of the one the she remembers from her childhood in Japan. The adapted method cuts out a few steps in the shaping process, but the result is a loaf as soft, white, and tender as any. What that the modified recipe doesn\u2019t include, however, are a few tell-tale signs of a more traditional technique: a few vertical seams and a jelly roll\u2013like pattern on the bread\u2019s surface. For home cooks who want to go the extra mile, use the exact same recipe (find that right here), but follow these steps below once your dough has completed its initial proof and is ready to punch down and shape.Photo by Chelsie CraigPunch down proofed dough.Photo by Chelsie CraigDivide into six pieces and shape each into a ball.Photo by Chelsie CraigFlip one ball over so seam side is facing up. Then, roll out dough so that it forms a 5x4\" rectangle about 1/2\" thick.Photo by Chelsie CraigWith your fingers, roll the dough up lengthwise into a jelly roll, making sure that the corners meet the edges of the dough. (It doesn\u2019t need to be rolled tightly, but it should be rolled evenly and symmetrically.)Photo by Chelsie CraigSituate the jelly roll so the seam side is facing up, and then pitch the seam so its sealed. Repeat with remaining balls.Photo by Chelsie CraigTake both ends of a rolled log, and bring them together so it forms a gentle U shape. Repeat with remaining logs.Photo by Chelsie CraigLiberally butter two 9x5x5\" pain de mie pans and lids or 9x5\" loaf pans. Place three logs in alternating directions in each pan.At this point, you can return to the recipe, picking right back up where it says to cover the pans with plastic wrap and return them to warm spot.Explore Bon App\u00e9titRecipeBreadtechniqueRead MoreMilk BreadcookingI\u2019d Invite Myself Over for This Spicy Chicken Katsu SandwichBy Elyse InamineRecipes you want to make.
