SpotIt\u2019s a California food wonderland.By Adam RapoportMarch 5, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Adam RapoportFacebookTwitterEmailEvery Monday night, Bon App\u00e9tit editor in chief Adam Rapoport gives us a peek inside his brain by taking over our newsletter. He shares recipes he's been cooking, restaurants he's been eating at, and more. It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.I was half way to LAX Friday morning when I glanced at my Delta app and noticed that my 9:30 a.m. flight to JFK would be departing at 3:40 p.m.Hmm...Two thoughts immediately popped in my head.One, I\u2019m heading back to the hotel for a couple more hours of sleep.Two, then I\u2019m going to Gjusta.If you love food\u2014and, certainly, if you work at Bon App\u00e9tit\u2014a trip to L.A. almost always means a trip to Travis Lett\u2019s bustling deli/coffee shop/sandwich joint/bakery/all-around food wonderland.Want this letter before it hits the website? Sign up for our newsletter!Peden + MunkIt\u2019s the kind of place where everything looks good, and you need to seriously strategize before ordering.I arrived in Venice Beach around 12:30 p.m., and I immediately channeled my inner Alex Delany, ordering a cortado and grabbing a stool at the worn-down marble counter to study the menu. The woman next to me was dividing her bites between one of Gjusta\u2019s what\u2019s-good-at-the-market-that-day grain salads and a particularly California-looking bagel of her own devising\u2014hummus, quick-pickled onions, cucumbers and, of course, avocado.I was feeling more lunchy than breakfast, so I turned my attention to the sandwich portion of the menu. The guy to my right, on the same frequency, opted for the justifiably praised smoked brisket baguette with a side of jus. Tempting, but having gone out the night prior to Park\u2019s for Korean BBQ with BA\u2019s wine editor Marissa Ross\u2014who rolled up with three BYO bottles of natural wine\u2014I was thinking something a smidge less meaty.So I settled on the chicken banh mi and a bag of freshly made potato chips, which you\u2019ll find sitting next to the register, daring you not to order them.If you live in, or spend much time in L.A., Gjusta is the kind of place where you always run into someone because everyone seems to end up there.Just as I was ordering, I bumped into Jay and Alison Carroll, hoteliers, branding savants, and friends of BA. They too were on their way to LAX, a quick 20 minute ride away. (If you haven\u2019t gotten the memo by now: Stop at Gjusta on your way to the airport\u2014to eat in or to grab any number of goods for the plane.)Peden & MunkWe sat down at one the many picnic tables out back, set out our mix-and-match order of food and snapped a flurry of requisite Instagram images in the perfect Southern California light. (For optimal color impact, do like Alison and order the smoked-fish plate.)Then I quite literally had to jet. So I said goodbye to Jay and Alison, grabbed a freshly baked chocolate cookie on my way out the banged-up wooden screen door and hopped a car to LAX.It\u2019s almost as if I wished for that five-hour flight delay.Explore Bon App\u00e9titAdam NewsletterRead MorecookingMaster the Italian Hero and Be the Hero of Every PartyBy Adam Rapoportbest-new-restaurantsGjusta, Los AngelesBy Andrew KnowltonPhotography by Peden + MunkRecipes you want to make.
