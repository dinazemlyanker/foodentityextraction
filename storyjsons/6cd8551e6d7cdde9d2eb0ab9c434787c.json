It'll make you forget about hummus.Ingredients4 servings3medium parsnips (about 1 lb.), trimmed, scrubbed3Tbsp. blanched hazelnuts1cup dill fronds\u00bdcup grapeseed or avocado oil2serrano chiles, finely chopped1garlic clove, crushed\u00becup crumbled feta\u2153cup fresh lemon juice\u00bccup extra-virgin olive oilPreparationStep 1Preheat oven to 350\u00b0.

Not sure how you could use two full ones.Anonymous3/9/2022Tripled the garlic. Skipped the chiles and hazelnuts. So yummy!!!! Used it for dipping carrots, radishes, bell pepperMadelineChicago3/6/2022This was the perfect afternoon snack to hold two of us over until dinner. I cut the recipe in 1/2 and didn't have any nuts to top this dip and it was a HIT.  I served it with cherry tomatoes, carrots, cucumbers and celery. This dip is packed with both sweet and savory flavor, and a beautifully smooth texture. The best part....We put this in the fridge for a midnight snack :)\n\nAlso, I boiled my parsnips on medium for 15(ish) minutes to speed the process. I love to freeze parsnip juice/water for the next time I make bone broth.cookin4fourChicago5/10/2020Excellent with or without the hazelnut topping. Great with pita or with meat for dipping. I tripled the garlic - 1 clove is barely there. The dip has wonderful balance with the sweetness from the parsnips, the savoriness of the feta, and the spice from the chiles. Have made this several times. Especially good on hot days, served chilled.SrAsparagusOakland, CA11/15/2019Absolutely delicious and easy to make!AnonymousNYC1/19/2019Explore Bon App\u00e9titDipGreekEuropeanParsnipVegetableHazelnutNutSerrano ChileChileFetaCheeseWinterStarterVegetarianGluten-FreeHealthyishDinnerRecipes you want to make.
