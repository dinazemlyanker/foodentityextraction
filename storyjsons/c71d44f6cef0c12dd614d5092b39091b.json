Cooking a lean cut of meat like brisket (see note below) for an extended period of time in a moist environment yields meat that is, in Sabrina\u2019s words, \u201cridiculously juicy [and] tender, [with] plenty of flavor.\u201d She recommends serving it \u201cwith mashed root vegetables or shredded up and served with flatbread, yogurt, and a dash of pomegranate molasses, pomegranate seeds, and some fresh herbs, such as mint.\u201d Leftovers make for an excellent sandwich or pot pie filling, or combine them with a can of coconut milk and serve over rice for a comforting stew.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Diamond Crystal or 1\u00be tsp. Morton kosher salt1tsp. ground cinnamon1tsp. ground cumin1tsp. ground fenugreek1tsp. ground turmericFreshly ground black pepperPreparationStep 1A note on the meat: The original recipe calls for \u201cboned and rolled beef brisket,\u201d a cut that\u2019s common in the U.K. but not available in the U.S. Instead, ask your butcher to roll a 5\u00bd lb. untrimmed flat-cut beef brisket for you. While the meat will be slightly different, the cooking method\u2014low, slow, plenty of liquid\u2014will yield the same successful results, says Heather Marold Thomason of Primal Supply Meats.\u00a0If your meat comes unrolled, you can roll it yourself: Turn it over so that the fatty side is against your cutting board. Roll it up into a thick log. Tie meat at 1\" intervals with kitchen twine\u2014double-knot each tie for extra security. Make sure that you roll it so that the grain runs the length of the roast\u2014that way, when you slice it, you\u2019ll be cutting against the grain.Step 2Preheat oven to 350\u00b0. Stir 2 (heaping) Tbsp. rose harissa, 1 Tbsp. Diamond Crystal or 1\u00be tsp. Morton kosher salt, 1 tsp. ground cinnamon, 1 tsp. ground cumin, 1 tsp. ground fenugreek, 1 tsp. ground turmeric, a generous amount of freshly ground black pepper, and 3 cups water in a medium bowl until evenly combined.Step 3Place brisket in a Dutch oven or an ovenproof casserole dish with a lid and pour spice mixture over. Roast, uncovered, basting every 30 minutes or so, for 2 hours.Step 4Cover pot and bake, basting meat every 30 minutes, for another 2 hours. Remove lid and roast brisket until deeply brown and an instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part registers 195\u00b0\u2013205\u00b0, about 1 hour. Let rest in pot 30 minutes, then slice against the grain. Serve with any liquid in pot spooned over.Step 5Do ahead: Brisket can be cooked 3 days ahead. Let cool; cover and chill.Adapted from Simply: Easy Everyday Dishes by Sabrina Ghayour. Copyright \u00a9 2020 by\u00a0Sabrina Ghayour. Reprinted with permission from Mitchell Beazley.

I use a crockpot for everything, so very slight modify: seared the brisket on all sides in a cast iron skillet, deglazed the skillet with 2 cups red wine, mixed the spices into the warm wine in the skillet and poured over the roast in crockpot. Let it go about 8 hours on low. I've never seen a \"lean\" brisket, and had to untie mine to trim off the 30% fat it came with. As it cooked it unfurled and tried to crawl out of the pot. Second time I made this I just cut it into three slabs, which made the searing much easier as well.troutappleTucson11/10/2021Why has Bon Appetit not responded to the comment below from San Diego and the mix up on rolling and cutting the meat?  It seems to be this is a very good question and should be answered unless no one there cares about the comments.AnonymousSouth of Mt. Shasta1/10/2021Made this with a 3lb - ish cut of rolled brisket (as I was ambitiously feeding a household of two) and adjusted the time by reducing the covered portion of the bake by 30 minutes. So, SO good, so very simple, and perfect for a stay-at-home Christmas. Went on little walks between the basting intervals. A knockout dish!AnonymousQueens, NY12/26/2020The seasoning was wonderful and I'll use it again.  My roast was up to temperature in 4 hrs and looked beautiful.  However, I found that by tying it the grain became very dense and it was more like a roast beef grain then a braised brisket.  So, I would not make it rolled again.  Also, the directions say to unroll it before you slice it.  This can't be correct since it says to tie it on the long side so when you cut it, it's against the grain.  It would be very messy to try and unroll.
