And I\u2019m here to tell you that regardless of your situation (mine is far from perfect), you can and should own a grill\u2014specifically a $35 portable Weber charcoal grill.Weber Smokey Joe Portable Grill$42 at AmazonSmall enough to fit inside an oversize tote bag and lightweight enough to actually carry around, this little grill is truly summer\u2019s hottest accessory. Whether you have a complete lack of outdoor space or you\u2019re just not ready to commit to the full-size version, it\u2019s ideal for taking to the park so you can grill among the people, which is an excellent way to spend a Saturday afternoon.Now, this isn\u2019t the time to play pitmaster\u2014the grill is so tiny you\u2019re not building a two-zone fire, nor do you have any business trying to cook, say, a leg of lamb. Instead, I bring along the basics: a grill brush so you can give the grate a quick scrub after you're done cooking; self-lighting briquettes (not my first choice, but they're extremely convenient in this situation); and, last but not least, hot dogs, buns, and bottles of mustard and ketchup.If you bring burger meat\u2014a more ambitious option\u2014you\u2019ll also want to pack a little baggie of kosher salt to season the patties. But no matter what, I always bring some chopped or sliced onions and crunchy lettuce to nestle into the buns along with the grilled goods.Everything else\u2014drinks, chips, extra condiments, salads, and sides\u2014gets outsourced to friends. Which means if I invite you to my grilling party at the park, be prepared to arrive with your best snacks in tow.Oh, you'd like another Party Trick, would you?Bless Your Next Party with Big Dip EnergyAin't no party like a Dip Party!View StoryExplore Bon App\u00e9titParty TricksEntertainingSummerGrillRead MoreThe Basically BurgerRecipes you want to make.
