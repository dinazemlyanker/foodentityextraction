That\u2019s all I\u2019m after. And in this package of 100 popcorn bags, I\u2019ve found it.By Alex BeggsMarch 1, 2021FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Emma FishmanFacebookTwitterEmailAll products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

I\u2019d tacked them on to an order from Webstaurantstore when I was stocking up on boring necessities like deli containers, squeeze bottles, and a snow-ready doormat. All those things are great\u2014buy \u2019em, use \u2019em, reuse \u2019em, etc. But these popcorn bags make me much much happier on a day-to-day basis, and they\u2019re cheaper than an impulse purchase of Us Weekly in the cashier line.First of all, look at these bags. I believe that classic popcorn bags are some of the best-designed food packages (those big tubs at AMC used to advertise movies don\u2019t count). The look has remained unchanged for decades. The graphics are simple but make the most of their small space. There\u2019s enthusiasm, and stripes! They tell you what you\u2019re gonna get. For further proof that popcorn containers are high art, let me point to Andy Warhol\u2019s popcorn box quadrant, which I much prefer to his splashy Campbell\u2019s soup cans.I\u2019ll never forget the most beautiful popcorn bag I\u2019ve come across, at a car rental office in Houston. (That\u2019s exactly the kind of place where beauty hides. Are you looking for it?) It was red and orange with \u201cFresh,\u201d \u201cPop,\u201d and \u201cCorn\u201d on separate lines, and a row of white popcorn dancing on the bottom. You can buy 1000 of those bags for $20 here, which I should note, is a large quantity.The bags I bought, though, are red and tan, with bold vertical stripes and five dancing kernels at the bottom. They\u2019re 1 oz., enough for three-to-four handfuls of popcorn. They read: \u201cPop Corn, Hot n\u2019 Fresh.\u201d $3.99 for 100 grease-resistant bags. The reviews, all two of them, are glowing.I\u2019ve mostly used them to give away cookies and homemade nut mixes to friends, family, and the mail carrier. Around the holidays, I \u201cwrapped\u201d small presents in them. You could fill your popcorn bags with actual popcorn, take a walk around the neighborhood. If you\u2019re sporty, you can pack your homemade date-and-cacao energy bites in them, tuck it in the back of your bike jersey/ski pants, and never have to worry about the oil staining your spandex. Fill a bag with breadcrumbs, feed some local pigeons\u2014this is your carnival now. Store tampons in your purse in them. Mail your rent check in one (inside a larger envelope) to surprise and delight your landlord. I dunno, get creative!I have so, so, so many popcorn bags.Carnival King Popcorn Bags$4 at Webstaurant Store$11 at AmazonExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendRecipes you want to make.
