I learned to slice and freeze fresh sourdough, divide ground beef into single-serving freezer packs, stash an emergency DiGiorno pizza, and keep stacks on stacks of Caramelo tortillas. But the most important thing I learned about my cold storage is ALWAYS LEAVE ROOM FOR MALAI ICE CREAM.Pooja Bavishi, Malai\u2019s founder and CEO, creates incredible ice cream flavors by combining South Asian ingredients and spices with a creamy eggless base made from fresh New York dairy. Malai\u2019s ice creams are churned with very little air, which results in a light, gelato-like texture. It perfectly contrasts all the mix-ins like ribbons of mango pur\u00e9e for the Mango & Cream and chunks of homemade baklava for the, well, Baklava.I\u2019m lucky enough to live around the corner from Malai\u2019s signature Brooklyn scoop shop, but that hasn\u2019t stopped me from packing my freezer full of its colorful cartons. (Pro tip: You can also buy Malai at grocery stores along the coasts and online via Goldbelly.) Knowing I have a cold pint of peppery Masala Chai or Coconut Tahini with Date Caramel is enough to get me through washing an endless pile of dirty dishes every night. Now, just where are all the clean spoons?Go there: Malai Ice Cream & CakesExplore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingIce CreamRead MorecultureI Make My Own Ice Cream, But I Fully Endorse Jeni\u2019s PintsBy Sohla El-WayllyRecipes you want to make.
