It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.The new thing this week is for everyone to start complaining that summer is almost over. I\u2019m not here to disagree. I\u2019m a pessimistic-realist, so summer started being over for me right after Memorial Day. It became an urgent concern when we were planning our 4th of July menu, and now that my mid-August birthday has passed, it\u2019s a national emergency.The only thing left to do is cancel all of your commitments, cash in your remaining vacation days, go AWOL on adult responsibilities, and hightail it to the beach. Or the lake, or the riverbank, or a ding-dang swimming hole. I\u2019d personally get to the beach a lot faster if I wasn\u2019t so obsessed with packing the perfect things to eat while I\u2019m there, but I take a lot of pride in my beach snacks. Here are my 10 favorites, ranked for your countdown pleasure.10.) Cold watermelon is amazing and perfect. The triangular wedge is classic, but I really love to remove the rind and cut the flesh into fat planks before packing them into a quart container. Pro tip: bring lime wedges and a tiny jar of salt for seasoning al fresco.9). Peanut butter and jelly sandwiches are compact, tidy, and get exquisitely squishy when packed ahead of time. I\u2019m an untoasted whole-wheat pullman, crunchy peanut butter, mixed berry jam person, with a sprinkle of salt before closing them up, and a diagonal cut obviously.Want this letter before it hits the website?

Frozen grapes. Sorry not sorry. Put them in an insulated container so they stay icy for many hours and don\u2019t you dare criticize me until you\u2019ve tried it.5.) Ice coffee shakerato in a to-go cup. This recipe in this vessel. Lots of ice. Shakey shakey every time before you take a sip.Christopher Testani4.) BLTs with sriracha mayo, and a slab (not a shred!) of iceberg lettuce. Toasted white bread. Good tomatoes. Don\u2019t sleep on this one\u2014find your spot, set up the blanket and umbrella, go for a quick dip, and consume immediately.3.) Grain salad + spork. I like wheat berries with sliced jalape\u00f1os, slabs of feta, diced cucumber, lots of chopped herbs, coarsely chopped toasted almonds, and a super-lemony vinaigrette.2.) Chips. It\u2019s a tie between Kettle Brand salt and vinegar and Cape Cod original.1.) A perfect peach. I know\u2014painfully romantic. But there\u2019s no better time than right now, and the water is right there for rinsing off when you\u2019re done.Explore Bon App\u00e9titCarla NewsletterRead MorerestaurantsRockaway Beach Bakery Is the Real Reason I Go to the BeachBy Chris MoroccocultureThis Is the Only Folding Chair I Want at the Beach This SummerBy Amiel StanekLifestyleThis Water Bottle Keeps EVERYTHING Icy ColdBy Aliza AbarbanelcultureThis Vintage Wine Cooler Is My Ultimate Summer AccessoryBy Aliza AbarbanelRecipes you want to make.
