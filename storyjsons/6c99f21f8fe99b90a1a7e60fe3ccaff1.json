RossDecember 12, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Marissa RossFacebookTwitterEmailPark the Prius because today\u2019s hottest hybrids aren\u2019t for driving. They\u2019re for drinking. After a week spent neck-deep in hybrid grapes during a recent trip to Vermont, I\u2019m now convinced that these long-ignored fruits are responsible for some of the most exciting wines in America, if not the world.I\u2019m talking bottles of La Crescent that crackled with the acidity of a dozen grapefruits and sang like Annette Funicello\u2019s \u201cPineapple Princess\u201d\u2014the grape should have the world\u2019s best Rieslings shaking in their boots. I tried Frontenac Noirs that gave me goose bumps, tasting like spiced cranberries rolled up and smoked in violets, and Marquettes that left my insides as fuzzy as my favorite sweater. Discovering these unsung grapes\u2014add Baco Noir and St. Croix to that list too\u2014inspired the same feeling as coming across a new wine region: exciting to explore and delightful to drink. Get yourself a bottle from Barnard, Vermont, winemaker La Garagista and you\u2019ll see.But wait. If they\u2019re so damn good, why haven\u2019t you heard of them until now? Well, that\u2019s because hybrid grapes are the black sheep of the vine. Disparaged. Maligned. Tied up and gagged in the basement. The industry at-large would rather you didn\u2019t know about them. And that\u2019s exactly why I\u2019m here to proselytize for them, champion them, and declare that we should all be drinking a whole lot more of them.But first, how they\u2014and their unfair reputation\u2014came to be.In the late 19th century, phylloxera, an insect that attacks grapevine roots, destroyed most of Vitis vinifera\u2014the OG winemaking grape species\u2014in a very black plague\u2013like fashion. But no one wanted to stop drinking wine, so in the early 20th century, humans did what they always do and found a way to keep producing it: by crossing two or more different grape species (typically Vitis vinifera and Vitis labrusca, in case you, you know, care) to create hybrid grapes.The genetic diversification made the plants not only more resistant to phylloxera, but also more impervious to fungal diseases (like powder mold) and more tolerant of cold climates. When they debuted in the early 1900s, they were a hit across the chilly climes of New England and the Midwest. Europe, on the other hand, used them for like a minute before deciding hybrids weren\u2019t bougie enough. France even went so far as to ban hybrid grapes for commercial wines in 1934, and in 1955 the country made it illegal to sell wines made with them. Austria allows the use of hybrid grapes today, but they\u2019re relegated to the lowest ranking appellation classification.TL;DR: Hybrid grapes are the mutts of the wine world, and for decades the wine industry has basically been the American Kennel Club, shunning them and the wines they produce for not being purebred. Their critics claim the fruits do not demonstrate the depth or subtleties of Vitis vinifera and that their wines are \u201cfoxy\u201d\u2014and not in the 1970s funk kind of way. In wine jargon, foxy describes juice that smells and/or tastes like musky Welch\u2019s grape juice, which is not a good vibe. (Vitis labrusca is also known as the fox grape, which gives you an idea of where the disdainful descriptor came from.)And yes, while I was out there in Vermont, I did run into Brianna\u2014a polarizing hybrid grape that probably incited the whole species\u2019 negative reputation in the first place: Brianna can be \u201cfoxy\u201d as hell. But out of the dozens of wines I tried in five days, I had only one bottle of Brianna that was truly gross. To me that says, \u201cHey, maybe we shouldn\u2019t discriminate against an entire genre of wines that are perfectly delicious and disease resistant because of a few bad Briannas.\u201d We all had a few bad Briannas our graduating year of high school; that doesn\u2019t mean our entire class was worthless!Here\u2019s the thing: Today\u2019s wine drinkers forego the \u201crules\u201d of the old guard. We embrace experimentation, and we\u2019re not afraid of grapes we\u2019ve never heard of. We actively seek out new experiences in bottles of wine, and we want everything that hybrid wines represent. So, it\u2019s up to us to spread the word and give these wines a seat at the table. Let\u2019s start looking for them, asking for them, and purchasing them. There is no supply without demand.Explore Bon App\u00e9titWineRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
