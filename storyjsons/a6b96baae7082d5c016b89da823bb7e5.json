The year is now 2019, Passover is only a few weeks away, and there\u2019s something new plaguing us: The realization that we\u2019ve been thinking about our matzo balls all wrong.In our quest to develop BA\u2019s Best Matzo Ball Soup (read all about that saga here), we dug into one of the holiday\u2019s most essential components, parsing through the generations of lore to see what really makes the best ball. After weeks of testing (and eating lots and lots of matzo balls), we discovered that, while every family makes theirs a little differently, a few common misconceptions prevail\u2014and a few small changes can really make a difference.The first of many A/B matzo ball tests\nPhoto by Emily Schultz1. The great seltzer debate: A lot of matzo ball recipes will tell you to add baking powder or seltzer, which is said to curb the density of matzo balls and make them lighter and fluffier. We did a side by side\u2014by side by side\u2014comparison for both of these factors and decided that adding it in didn\u2019t affect the texture enough to pop open a can of plain La Croix.2. Get schmaltzy: Schmaltz, or rendered chicken fat, is like gold. And you deserve nothing but the best. The flavor and texture that schmaltz gives a matzo ball is nothing that vegetable oil can really compare to, which is why if you can get it (or make it!), use the good stuff.3. Herb is your friend: The first time I heard about someone adding fistfulls of herbs directly *into* their matzo ball batter was when senior editor Sasha Levine waxed poetic about her family\u2019s recipe\u2014packed so full of dill and parsley, they\u2019re practically green. Intrigued, Molly added some chopped dill for a nice speckled effect, but didn\u2019t go as far as Sasha.Don\u2019t they look happy in BA\u2019s Best Matzo Ball Soup?\nPhoto by Chelsie Craig, Food Styling by Kate Buckens4. Salt not stock: Matzo balls are like sponges, and they take on the flavor of whatever liquid they\u2019re cooked in. You\u2019ll see some recipes call for simmering them in chicken stock, while others ask for salty water\u2014but how salty is the question. Molly tested a bunch of different ratios and found that if your water is too salty, your matzo balls will be too, but if your water isn\u2019t seasoned enough, all of the flavor in the balls will leach out into the water that you\u2019ll eventually discard. Three quarts of water to three tablespoons of salt is the perfect ratio, and results in an even more flavorful ball than balls cooked in stock.5. Hard to handle: Jewish grandmothers will pinch your shayna punim (yiddish for beautiful face) until your cheeks turn red, but will hardly even touch their matzo balls lest they turn out dense\u2014the sin of all matzo ball sins. So Molly set out to find the perfect texture, trying one batch where she shaped them til they were *just* spherical and another batch where she rolled them to form perfect spheres. Though the extra surface tension gave the second batch a more textured bite, it didn\u2019t make them tough or springy. The moral of the story? Don\u2019t worry about over handling the batter too much; just get the balls to the size and shape you want.6. A quiet murmur: You don\u2019t have to worry too much about over-handling your matzo balls, but you should consider the vigorousness of your boil. Molly says it\u2019s incredibly important that your matzo balls cook at a simmer, because a roiling boil will be too harsh and could cause them to disintegrate. And if you\u2019ve already gone through all this trouble, you definitely don\u2019t want that.Get the recipe:BA\u2019s Best Matzo BallsThe perfect matzo ball doesn\u2019t require seltzer, baking powder, egg whites, or even a light touch, and this recipe proves it.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titMatzoPassoverSoupRecipes you want to make.
