It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.I\u2019ve been thinking about beans a lot lately, because I\u2019ve been making a lot of beans lately, and the thought process unfolds in a very predictable way.Me: I love beans; I want to eat beans; making beans is a delight; I\u2019m so glad I have cooked beans.I have the first and second thoughts sometime on Saturday night or Sunday morning, and that\u2019s the signal for me to put a few cups of dried beans in a pot big enough to cook them in, cover them with cold water, and set them on my stovetop to soak.Want this letter before it hits the website? Sign up for our newsletter!Brothy and beautiful.\nPeden + MunkHours later, or the next day, I click on the burner under that pot and I have the third realization, as I start the joyful process. I make all beans the same way, and I\u2019ve covered that extensively, so I won\u2019t rehash it again here. (Don\u2019t drain the soaking water!) The revelation is all the things you can do with the beans once they\u2019re made. A pound of beans will yield two to three quarts of cooked beans, depending on how brothy they are, and those will hold in the fridge for many days. I love to eat a bowl of hot brothy beans seasoned with a squeeze of lemon or lime, a few dashes of hot sauce, and a warm tortilla, but there\u2019s a lot more you can do with them than that. Here are nine of those potential payoffs:Make the ultimate refried beans. Skip to the second stage. Use any bean. Rejoice.Drain the cooked beans, then marinate them. Beans on toast! Beans in a salad! Beans as a side dish!Have tasty tomatoes around?! (I know, it\u2019s fall, but dare to dream.) Beans and tomatoes is a dream combo.Get married to some mushrooms and farro and make this incredibly slurpy soup.This seedy arepa recipe features black beans in an award-worthy supporting role, but you could make with pinto, cannellini, kidney beans, lentils...Reheat and finish them with cream, which is honestly great advice for so many things.Add them to pasta! Beans, greens, sausage, noodles\u2026 hello dinner in 20 minutes.Or this pasta, with quick-cooking mussels and a zippy tomato sauce.Okay I haven\u2019t done this yet, but I\u2019m going to: Pour off half a cup of the brothy bean liquid and turn it into a delicious dressing with mustard, vinegar, some chopped shallots, and chopped tender herbs if you have them. I think this would be a stupendous way to sass up a batch of cooked grains or pot of rice, and I promise to do that and report back.Even more ways to cook beans:1 / 86ChevronChevronKale Minestrone With PistouView RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titCarla NewsletterBlack BeansCannellini BeanKidney BeansWhite BeanRead MorecookingThese White Beans Are More Reliable Than My WiFiBy Alex BeggscookingWhen You're Cooking Dried Beans, You're Already Halfway to SoupBy Sarah JampelcookingWhat's The Deal With The Goop In Canned Beans?By Emma WartzmancookingNow That I Know How To Cook Beans, I\u2019m Making This Dish All The TimeBy Emily SchultzRecipes you want to make.
