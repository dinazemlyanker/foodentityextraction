Fallon/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesFacebookTwitterEmailSay goodbye to \"Whole Paycheck\"\u2014Whole Foods's newest outpost is more of the \"Half Paycheck\" variety. The grocery chain announced Thursday that the seventh Whole Foods Market 365, its lower-priced, millennial-focused mini-chain, will open in Brooklyn next week, bringing the brand's locally sourced foods and grab-and-go options to the East Coast for the first time since the first 365 store opened in 2016.According to a press release, New York's own Whole Foods Market 365 will be located in Fort Greene, in the 300 Ashland building near the Atlantic Terminal and Barclays Center, and will open on Wednesday, January 31. Not only will the 30,000-square foot space house the typical butcher counter, antipasto bar, wide array of artisan cheeses, hot and cold grab-and-go bars, bakery, and generous selections of craft beer and wine, but it will also feature a caf\u00e9 level containing \"four distinct venues.\" These \"Friends of 365\" include Next Level Burger, marking the plant-based vegan burger joint's first non-West Coast outpost; NYC institution Orwasher's Bakery & Coffee Bar; organic and vegan health food chain Juice Press; and the POURiT Authority (get it?!), Whole Foods Market 365's first foray into what they call the \"get it your d*mn self\" model of self-serve beer, cider, and wine, powered by \"reloadable electronic cards and digital screens.\"Brooklynites hardy enough to brave what are sure to be massive crowds at next week's grand opening will get to sample coffee and snacks from Whole Foods and the Friends of 365, and will be able to snatch some swag from the four brands. The first 100 visitors to the store will receive a mystery Whole Foods gift card, ranging in value from $5 to $365; if you'd like to try your luck, be sure to get in line well before the 9 a.m. opening time. Additionally, five percent of the new store's net sales on opening day will be donated to the Fort Greene Park Conservancy as part of its \"5 Percent Day.\"The first Whole Foods Market 365 store opened in Silver Lake, California, in May 2016, and was followed by five more in California, Ohio, Oregon, and Texas. But don't worry if none of those are near you\u2014and the post-Amazon buyout price slashing still isn't low enough for your liking\u2014since the Whole Foods website claims that 16 more stores in nine states across the country are in the works.
