And plenty of beer, too.FacebookPinterestTwitterEmailKee Byung-keunGO HERE: for a no-frills yakitori dinner. A lot of people in Tokyo will often say that simple is best, and this is never more true than when eating out. Kushiwakamaru is all golden oldies: all of your favorite chicken parts flavored by little more than salt, sauce, and smoke. Portions are generous and ordering half the menu is a common temptation. When you wash it all down with an unnecessarily large glass of beer, you have what a huge percentage of salarymen spend their office hours dreaming about.ORDER THE: favorites, like wings, skin, and hearts. The standouts are the tsukune (chicken meatballs), tanuki (a stuffed shiitake mushroom), and the chizu-pi (a green pepper stuffed with cheese and wrapped in bacon, like a Japanese jalape\u00f1o popper). Before you pump the brakes, order the dashaku-imo, a whole potato from Hokkaido that has been cooked over the coals and crowned with a big wedge of butter. Finish your meal with a stiff lemon sour and a bowl of rice topped with salmon roe.THE VIBE IS: an old-school affair\u2014warm, smoky, and unpretentious. It\u2018s almost always crowded and conversations can get raucous when fueled by so much good food and alcohol.PRACTICAL STUFF: Open daily from 5 p.m. to midnight. The menu is available in English and the staff speaks some English. Reservations are recommended but not necessary. The nearest subway station is Naka-meguro.By Kee Byung-keunExplore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
