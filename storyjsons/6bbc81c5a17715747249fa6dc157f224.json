Here, it\u2019s drizzled in olive oil and toasted, which helps keep it crunchy once the salad is dressed. While this fattoush recipe can be made year round, it is best in summer when tomatoes are at their peak, and their sweetness is offset by the tang of pomegranate molasses. If you don\u2019t already have this Middle Eastern pantry essential, look for bottles made without added sugar like this one from Lebanese brand Mymoun\u00e9, and use the leftovers for Pomegranate-Glazed Chicken with Buttery Pine Nuts or Lamb Shanks with Pomegranate and Walnuts.Editor\u2019s note: This recipe was originally published on April 16, 2012.Ingredients6 to 8 ServingsDressing4teaspoons ground sumac, soaked in 4 teaspoons warm water for 15 minutes3tablespoons (or more) fresh lemon juice2tablespoons (or more) pomegranate molasses2small garlic cloves, minced2teaspoons (or more) white wine vinegar1/2 teaspoon dried mint3/4 cup extra-virgin olive oilKosher saltSalad28-inch-diameter pita breads, halved, toasted until golden brown, broken into bite-size pieces1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oilKosher salt3medium ripe tomatoes, chopped, or 4 cups cherry tomatoes, halved1pound Persian cucumbers, or one 1-pound English hothouse cucumber, quartered lengthwise, thinly sliced crosswise6scallions, thinly sliced2Little Gem or baby romaine lettuces, or 1 small head romaine lettuce, trimmed, cut crosswise into 3/4-inch strips2cups (loosely packed) flat-leaf parsley leaves2cups purslane leaves or additional 3/4-inch-strips romaine lettuce1cup fresh mint leavesGround sumac (optional)PreparationDressingStep 1Combine sumac with soaking liquid, 3 Tbsp. lemon juice, 2 Tbsp. pomegranate molasses, garlic, 2 tsp. vinegar, and dried mint in a small bowl.

If you don't have them, don't make a fattoush.\nLoved this recipe. It transported me back to my childhood and grandmother's kitchen. The sumac and dried mint are essential.
