Before the workday starts, you\u2019ll find the Iranian-born principal designer in her \u2018office kitchen\u2019 preparing a Persian breakfast spread: feta cheese, eggs, and \u201clots of things to nibble on for hours.\u201d The enviable space, tucked inside a 1920s Spanish Colonial building on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles, is the heart of Studio Shamshiri\u2014a widely-admired multidisciplinary design firm opened by Shamshiri and her brother, Ramin, in 2016. As much a storyteller as she is a designer, Shamshiri\u2019s narrative-driven and research-heavy approach comes to life in both residential buildings (like Anne Hathaway\u2019s historic Californian country home) and commercial properties (like the eccentric, more-is-more Maison de la Luz hotel in New Orleans). After a year of near constant cooking and working from our dining tables, our kitchens are starting to feel as tired as we are. An expert in breathing life into any space, we enlisted Shamshiri to school us on mixing metals, balancing form and function, and incorporating natural materials like wood and slate.1. Commit to ColorPHOTO BY SHADE DEGGESWhen updating an existing kitchen, a bit of color works wonders. In this Manhattan home Shamshiri added new fronts to the standard developer cabinetry and painted them an unexpected shade of mustard. Want something similar?

Lean into WoodPHOTO BY YOSHIHIRO MAKINO\u201cWe\u2019re moving more and more toward wood,\u201d says Shamshiri, who finds the naturally occurring grain of bleached walnut or oiled oak to be timeless. In this La Jolla, CA, home, Shamshiri complements wood cabinets with green slate countertops and metals like copper Waterworks faucets and a stainless steel Wolf Dual Fuel range.Get the Look:COURTESY OF KOHLERCrue Kitchen Faucet by Kohler$622 $467 at Kohler$467 at Home DepotBrighton Floating Wood Shelf$149 at Pottery BarnTurkish Hand Towel$17 at Olive & LinenVilla Single Copper Sink$1,274 at Rejuvenation3. Skirt the ProblemPHOTO BY TREVOR TONDRO PHOTOGRAPHY, INC.\u00a0Traditionally used to mask plumbing or storage in country kitchens, sink skirts \u201ccan hide a lot of things,\u201d Shamshiri says of the vintage Indonesian fabric she hung beneath the kitchen sink at her L.A. office. DIY\u2019ers can use a tension rod and a sewing machine.Get the Look:COURTESY ANN SACKSZellige Tile$30 at Wayfair (per square foot)$30 at Ann Sacks (per square foot)Hammered Copper Tray$80 at AmazonHandwoven Indonesian Fabric$79 at Etsy4. Mix Your MetalsPHOTO BY STEPHEN KENT JOHNSONTop-quality equipment doesn\u2019t have to sacrifice style. For the Ojai, CA, home of Anne Hathaway, Shamshiri went with a handcrafted La Cornue Cha\u0302teau 120 range with a pale gray finish and mixed-metal trim. But she\u2019ll often go even bolder, choosing bright appliances by Lacanche.
