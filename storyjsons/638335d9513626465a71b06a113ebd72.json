More than you might think.By Wine AustraliaJuly 16, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailEDGE Steak & BarFacebookTwitterEmailAaron Brooks, the executive chef of EDGE Steak & Bar in Miami\u2019s Four Seasons Hotel, has worked up and down the eastern coast of his native Australia, in Canada, and in the United States. But there\u2019s a certain kinship he feels with his adopted city of Miami \u2014 and its distinctive cuisine.Executive Chef Aaron Brooks\nPhoto by Daniel Krieger\u201cIt\u2019s all the ways I like to eat,\u201d he says. \u201cLighter fare, grilled meats, wood-roasted vegetables, fire-roasted fish. Things I grew up with, in a warm climate. It\u2019s almost like a homecoming, cooking here, letting me do what I love.\u201dAt EDGE, Brooks is introducing an unconventional idea of what an American steakhouse can be. He doesn\u2019t limit himself to predictable meats, served in massive portions. \u201cAt some steakhouses, you get 14-ounce, 16-ounce, even 40-ounce cuts. I just don\u2019t like to eat protein like that,\u201d he says. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to be locked into a massive slab of meat on your plate. You can diversify it so much more.\u201dHe calls his approach \u201csteakhouse light\u201d \u2014 beautifully prepared steaks and the like, of course, but \u201caccompanied by fresh salads and crudos and ceviches. It\u2019s lighter, more progressive. We embrace the eclectic melting pot that Miami is.\u201dPrime Porterhouse, Roasted Mushrooms and Charred Brussels Sprouts\nPhoto by Daniel KriegerBrooks didn\u2019t have a deep knowledge of Latin or Caribbean cuisine when he came to Florida seven years ago, with prior experience in Vancouver and Boston after moving from Australia, but set about to remedy that. \u201cI love the community here, and I wanted to embrace it,\u201d he says. \u201cI wanted to learn more about it, and incorporate those flavors into our dishes.\u201dWhile EDGE is very much the product of Miami, there\u2019s a distinctly Australian element to his culinary philosophy. \u201cTo me, Australian food is really all about embracing the ingredients,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen I came to the States, it reminded me of what we then called \u2018California cuisine\u2019 \u2014 it\u2019s all about taking high-quality ingredients and treating them with respect.\u201dAnd Australian fare \u2014 like that of Miami \u2014 is inherently multicultural. A nation of immigrants, Australian cuisine draws influence from all over. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge community from Southeast Asia, but it goes well beyond that,\u201d says Brooks. \u201cI lived in a neighborhood in Melbourne for years that was predominantly Lebanese and Turkish \u2014 and the food in and around it was phenomenal. You can take those flavors and incorporate them into your food.\u201d\u201cAustralian food is embracing what\u2019s around you. Not only the product but the culture as well.\u201dOn a recent trip back to Australia he found inspiration in the wine scene that has taken off. \u201cWhat really, really excited me is the way Australia is on the forefront of natural wines,\u201d he says. \u201cI like the direction and opportunity to try new things, in addition to 'conventional' wine.\u201d\u201cThere is a real zest for the style in Oz and the folks down there are producing some phenomenal wines from both well-known and more obscure grape varieties.\u201dHis favorite wines of the moment often buck tradition in favor of experimentation. \u201cLucy Margaux Wines out of South Australia don't use any sulphur and refrain from intervention,\u201d he says. \u201cA fine line to tread, but they do it well. The Wildman Blanc is an absolute quaffer! Skin contact fermented 100% Savvy Blanc, wild yeasts with racy acidity. I absolutely love the stuff. A tropical drop perfect for Miami's scorching midday sun.\u201dLamb Chops & Sausage, Roasted Carrots, Onions, Coriander and Pepitas Vinaigrette\nPhoto by Daniel KriegerYou\u2019ll find many such wines in Australia, he believes, \u201cdone in a way that\u2019s not overdone. Where you taste the integrity of grape, but also the influence of terroir, and also the influence of the winemaker.\u201dBrash Higgins, the work of Brad Hickey, a Chicago native making wines in South Australia\u2019s McLaren Vale, is just one example. \u201cHe\u2019s almost like me,\u201d laughs Brooks; \u201cI\u2019m an Aussie guy in Miami cooking with American ingredients; he\u2019s an American dude doing great things with wine in South Australia.\u201d Hickey also works with Nero d\u2019Avola, an Italian variety, and ferments it in amphora, \u201cin these big open clay pots,\u201d Brooks says. \u201cIn the Australian climate, the wine has a juicy richness to it.\u201dEven Shiraz, a grape so deeply associated with Australia, isn\u2019t quite conventional in Brash Higgins\u2019s expression. \"It\u2019s not too fruit-forward,\u201d Brooks says. \u201cIt doesn't punch you in the face with jammy berriness.\"It\u2019s a wine Brooks would recommend with his signature lamb dish at EDGE \u2014 which, like the Shiraz, is iconically Australian, yet a bit unorthodox. \u201cOften people take a safe route with lamb,\u201d Brooks says. \u201cI go bolder, playing into the gaminess, with strong flavors that can really match up to it. I think that with a great char and great spices, you can\u2019t go wrong.\u201dHis Australian lamb is given an aggressive spice rub, then char-grilled. Lamb sausage, seasoned with a fenugreek-heavy spice blend called ararat, is grilled as well; it\u2019s all served with a dill- and honey-accented carrot yogurt, with whole slow cooked heirloom carrots, red onions, and a molasses vinaigrette. \u201cIt\u2019s inspired by what we call a 'Mixed Grill' in Australia,\u201d he explains, \u201cwhere various cuts of lamb are served on one plate all from the barbie.\u201d And yet the flavors on the plate are singular, eclectic and international.American steakhouses tend to be formal, even staid, which makes the lively environment Brooks encourages at EDGE so welcome. He attributes some of this to his childhood; his mother was a cook and his father managed pubs in Australia. \u201cThey were places where locals would come in and share beers, and share laughs,\u201d he says. \u201cTo me, it\u2019s a lot about the culture of a place. That\u2019s the way I like to cook and entertain as well.\u201d\u201cAustralian food to me is fun. It embraces people and embraces hospitality. It shouldn\u2019t stifle you, or become intimidating. That\u2019s what food should speak to \u2014 just getting together and having a good time.\u201dRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
