Pre-roasting all of the veggies. This step concentrates their flavor, and also helps to cook out some of their moisture, which would otherwise soak into the crust. When shaping the dough, don't be afraid to stretch it as thinly as possible\u2014if the dough is springing back on you, just be patient and let it rest for a few minutes.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

I have done ricotta flatbreads before and have just learned it\u2019s not good as a standalone cheese, since it has next to no flavor and is a little sweet. So, I used 2/3 ricotta and 1/3 fresh goat cheese, and added half of a lemon\u2019s juice and doubled the garlic, and added black pepper and more red pepper in the cheese. For the veg, I find zucchini and onions just get a little mush, especially when cooked for this long, so I roasted broccoli on the bottom rack while the rest was cooking on the top, and took it out after 10 minutes. I thought this really helped give the dish some more oomph. Lastly, I used basil instead of a mint just because of personal preference. If you do these minor changes, this is a really nice flatbread that saves pretty well! Side note: when I reheated this (in the oven at 275 for 10 mins) I found the ricotta was almost totally dried out. Luckily, I had saved some of the extra cheese mixture, and just stuck that on top with a drizzle of olive oil. If you can, save some of it when you make it because it\u2019s great for reheating (or just on some sourdough with olive oil!)skycooksMissouri3/23/2020This tasted great! The zucchini and the onions caramelized great in the oven, and everything came together very quickly.AnonymousColumbia, SC1/11/2020It was bland! I followed the recipe to a T, two times (once with naan instead of flatbread because that was all I had. Don't judge me. It tasted fine.) I gotta agree with the people in the comments that the ricotta approach ain't the right one. The lemon/garlicky-ness of it is good, but too mild to compliment the zucc as it deserves.  It just needs a lil pizzaz~NatWatAustin, TX9/24/2019Loved this! The tangy/sweet combo was delicious, and you can never go too much when it comes to loading on extra roasted veggies. I swapped out mint for basil because I had too much of it on my hands, and I would be interested to see which version I like better. I thought the basil worked well!AnonymousBoston, MA8/21/2019I absolutely loved this recipe!  The real star was the lemon zest; it brightened up the entire dish.  I roasted some additional vegetables, eggplant,  mushrooms, and cherry tomatoes because I love a lot of toppings on my pizza.   To get that perfect crunch I think it is important to be generous with the olive oil, and ensure the crust has baked enough before adding the toppings.  Overall great recipe, thank you!bgaudetteNorth Carolina7/4/2019There has to be a better topping than ricotta. I made this last night, following instructions and the ricotta made a gloppy mess. andrea.serna1@gmail.comLos Angeles6/27/2019To Anita459 and Lesvap: The recipe clearly states \"Preheat oven to 450 degrees.\" \n\nI know I'm late to the game, but I wanted to make sure anyone else reading this knows the temp! AnonymousNew York, NY 6/20/2019I roasted zucchini and red onion at 425F, and then pretty much went off the rails from there. I tore up some tuscan kale and threw it in the dregs of the zucchini/onion dressing and the first of the season's sweet corn. I took a cue from all you cheese mixers in the comments and whipped a 50/50 combo of ricotta and feta (no salt or lemon needed). Then I cut up some chorizo, cuz why the heck not. \n\nI still topped it with mint, though!\n\nFor anyone using a pre-formed dough with a longer bake time than suggested (for instance, mine says 17-22 minutes) I baked the dough blank for 10 minutes and then topped for 11. riff with abandonsan luis obispo, ca6/19/2019I took the advice of another reviewer and switched HALF of the ricotta for goat cheese to make it less sweet. I sliced the zucchs and red onion very thinly. It all carmelized beautifully! I also happened to mistakenly add the lemon zest to the pizza before I cooked it and it worked out fine. We traded out mint for basil leaves. Absolutely delicious flatbread pizza! We\u2019ll definitely do this again! Maybe with som added porcini mushrooms next time.AnonymousOregon5/26/2019Loved it. Switched out the ricotta for goat cheese to lessen sweetness. Will make again!AnonymousColorado 9/23/2018This is INCREDIBLY delicious. I don\u2019t understand how the other reviewers didnt like it. It tasted amazing!!!!! The mint is such a strange choice but pairs soooo well with the sweetness of the caramelized zucchini and onion. Making it again tomorrow!!AnonymousKuwait 9/13/2018After reading the review, I can see why Anita459 had problem caramelizing the zucchini.  The instructions need to list a temperature to roast the vegetables.  I'm thinking maybe 425-450 F, but I'm not sure.\nIt does look good, but I definitely would want my zucchinni to be carmalized if I tried this.LESVAPOklahoma9/10/2018I actually weighed the zucchini to make sure I had the correct amount.  After an hour, double the roasting time the zucchini was still not caramelized.  By that time I was done working on it.  The pizza was very sweet, not a good choice for dinner.  I won't be making this again.Anita459Oregon9/10/2018Explore Bon App\u00e9titFlatbreadBreadAmericanZucchiniSquashVegetableRed OnionOnionMintHerbs & SpicesRicottaCheeseSummerMainNut-FreeLunchDinnerBasicallyRecipes you want to make.
