It\u2019s usually \na single bite and, boom, I fall in love with a restaurant. \nThe pickle plate, starring (clockwise from top left) golden beets, jujubes, green strawberries, blueberries, a powder-dusted carrot, \nand a quail egg, alongside juniper utensils\nThe view from the U-shaped dining room counter\nCustom-made ceramics from OKC-based Sage Eden Pottery\nI stumbled upon Nonesuch while swiping through Instagram \nduring one of those late-night sessions I do after my wife falls asleep. The food on its feed looked beautiful and artistic and progressive, the kind of dishes you might find in Copenhagen \nor Tokyo or New York\u2014but not necessarily the Great Plains. \nI googled it. The results were meager. No big write-ups. No national press. And definitely no press release about it in my \nin-box. I started to wonder whether my internal restaurant \nradar was broken. How could something that seemed so compelling have so little buzz? Should I really book an out-\nof-the-way plane trip to Oklahoma based off a few well-lit Instagram photos?\n It was Thursday, \nprime time, and the place \nwas all but empty.\n\n\n\nThankfully, curiosity got the better of me. And six weeks later, as I stepped out into the sticky OKC air after that first dinner at Nonesuch, I was ecstatic and grateful. I was also full of questions: How did food this challenging materialize in a town known more for its massive chicken-fried steaks? Who was in the kitchen, and how did they learn how to cook like this? And in a world where everyone knows everything about a restaurant the minute it opens, how \nhad this place flown so under the radar? I had to find out.\n\nColin Stringer, Jeremy Wolfe, and Paul Wang are the chefs behind Nonesuch. All are under 30, and none have much in the way of professional culinary training. A month after my first meal, I was back in OKC, but this time I was sitting with the three chefs at Pho Cuong, their favorite Vietnamese restaurant. It\u2019s where you can usually find them eating b\u00fan ri\u00eau and finishing one another\u2019s sentences. Stringer, who was \u201creally bad at college,\u201d began his career washing dishes and scattering hash browns at Waffle House. Wolfe got his start at a restaurant where his buddy worked when the dishwasher quit. Unlike Stringer and Wolfe, both OKC natives, Wang was born in Hong Kong, then raised in Seoul and Southern California. His first job was at John\u2019s Incredible Pizza Company, a Chuck E. Cheese knockoff, where he was a guest-service rep and wore a bear costume. After watching them work and eating their food, I think the best analogy I can use to describe the trio, who jokingly call themselves the Mayflower Boys after their shared birth month, \nis three guys in a band, heads down, making incredibly beautiful music together\u2014that they doubt anyone will ever hear. \nTell me your names again?\n\n\n The best analogy I can \nuse to describe the trio is three \nguys in a band, heads down, \nmaking incredibly beautiful music together\u2014that they doubt anyone will ever hear.\nNonesuch doesn\u2019t have PR. As of press time it has only 5,000 Instagram followers. It has a small local fan base, many of \nwhom work with Nonesuch in some capacity. The chefs didn\u2019t spend years working for Boulud or Keller, although Wang did intern at Noma in Copenhagen. And it has a guy who makes waffle sandwiches. Stay with me. In 2014, Stringer and Wolfe (along with Andon Whitehorn) ran a pop-up called Nani in a creaky 100-year-old Victorian house in OKC. Nani became \na local phenomenon, selling out months in advance\u2014until the health department essentially shut it down for operating without \na license.\n\nChefs Colin Stringer, Paul Wang, and Jeremy Wolfe\nEAT LIKE THE CHEFS\n\n\n\n\nThe Nonesuch chefs at Pho Cuong\nA round at Prairie Artisan Ales \nWhat Waffle Champion is made of\nThe scene at Bar Arbolada\nOne of Nani\u2019s early guests was a guy named Todd Woodruff,\na local restaurateur who had a runaway hit called Waffle Champion (think waffles wrapped around chicken tenders, crispy leeks, and Tabasco honey). He fell for the gutsy cooking at Nani and the DIY vibe of the venture. \u201cI wanted \nto give them a new stage to keep doing what they love but also make a living doing it,\u201d Woodruff told me. Eventually \nhe contacted Stringer, who put much of the Nani band back together. Nonesuch, the name of the new project, opened in OKC\u2019s Midtown district on October 4, 2017.\nNonesuch is not ambitious for OKC; it\u2019s ambitious, period. The trio\u2019s inspiration is modern Nordic cooking\u2014a style of cuisine defined by hyper-local, often foraged ingredients, minimal but artful plating, and a love of all things fermented, pickled, and cured. What that means at Nonesuch is that if there\u2019s a protein, vegetable, piece of fruit, or dairy product on the plate, it comes from Oklahoma. For some cooks this would mean culinary suicide, but for Stringer, Wang, and Wolfe, it is the whole reason for the restaurant\u2019s existence. \n\nWang is super technical and can pickle and ferment anything\u2014\nskills he picked up during his Noma stint. Stringer has a way with aging and cooking meats and knows more than anyone should about vinegars, a key component in many Nonesuch dishes. He\u2019s also the kitchen general. Wolfe, the baby of the bunch at 25, is a bread and dessert Jedi who made even this dessert skeptic a fan. I\u2019m not alone. Greg Elwell, the former restaurant critic for the Oklahoma Gazette, told me about Wolfe\u2019s cr\u00e8me anglaise s\u2019more: \u201cIt was legit one of my top desserts of the last decade. I ate it with my eyes closed,\u201d he remembers. \u201cThe woman I was with decided then and there \nthat nothing was going to happen between us, because who wants to date the guy who gets weird with food.\u201d\nGrilled chicken hearts? \nColostrum custard? \nAre you kidding?\n\nNonesuch is not ambitious \nfor OKC; it\u2019s ambitious, period.\nAll three chefs share a passion for Oklahoma ingredients. But the fact that everything is from in-state is not a narrative they want \nto shove in people\u2019s faces. To them it\u2019s just what responsible chefs do in 2018. Of course, it\u2019s easier to abide by that philosophy when you live in, say, California or even Washington, D.C. But \nin a landlocked state like Oklahoma it can be difficult. The Nonesuch guys see these limitations as a positive. \u201cI think it helps our creativity because if we could cook with anything we wanted, well, I\u2019m not sure that we would know what to do,\u201d Wolfe says.\n\nThis connection to place is part of what makes Nonesuch so special. Take the tea course that usually arrives near the end of the tasting menu, the one that most people overlook until they take a sip. It\u2019s not fresh chamomile or even some rare pu-erh. It\u2019s made with as many as 12 ingredients that the chefs have foraged over the years, which they steep in hot water. \u201cNot only was it utterly delicious, but I remember thinking that I was drinking an entire year of Oklahoma,\u201d Elwell recalls. \u201cEvery season. Every storm. Every drought. That still blows my mind.\u201d \n\nTime to sort the elderflowers\nColostrum custard with peas \nOn my second visit to the restaurant, Stringer asked if I was interested in trying a new dish and, of course, I was game. It involved barely poached double-shucked English peas (to remove any bitterness), strawberry vinegar, and coriander flowers. All of that was sitting atop the silkiest, most perfect custard I\u2019ve ever eaten. The dairy used to make the custard is what sold me. It was cow\u2019s colostrum. The glossy description of colostrum: \u201cWhen cows give birth in the spring, the immediate milk they give is extremely high in protein.\u201d (That\u2019s how Stringer put it on the Nonesuch Instagram. ) The real-life, deal-with-it description: bovine breast milk. I defy anyone who likes dairy not to fall for it. It was the most intensely flavored dairy-based dish I\u2019d ever tasted. It was grassy and needed no gelatin, just a bit of heat, to create a custard. I had never tasted a dish like it. \u201cWe have the freedom to cook whatever we want. So I think it\u2019s very easy for us to be like, what do we have to lose, let\u2019s put it on the menu,\u201d Stringer says. \nCould Nonesuch be \nthe restaurant to put OKC, \nwhich as far as I could \ntell was still heavy on steaks \nand onion burgers, on the \nnational dining map?\nOf course, you can cook some of the best, most compelling personal food on the planet using hyper-local and foraged ingredients and have an amazing story to back it all up, but if it\u2019s not delicious, does it really matter? I\u2019ve been to plenty of\nwell-known spots where the food looks incredible on the plate\nbut fizzles when you taste it. I was worried during my first trip that this would be the case with Nonesuch\u2019s beautiful dishes\u2014all Instagram glam, no boom. Then Wang arrived with a delicate mushroom crepe filled with mint, lovage, sorrel, and nasturtium and dusted with smoked wild chive powder. It was like eating your way through an ethereal herb garden. And then there was a rich and deeply flavored steak tartare piled on a sabl\u00e9 cracker. God knows I\u2019ve had my fair share of steak tartare in 2018, but this one was made from the dry-aged meat of a dairy cow and cut into slightly larger chunks, resulting in a beefy flavor times ten. What these guys lacked in confidence and oratory skills (a few dishes were described in a head-down mumble by the chefs), they more than made up for in technique and taste. These kids could really cook.\n\nTHE TASTING MENU\nOne night. Ten courses\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompressed courgette and fava\u2013stuffed squash blossom  \nBison tartare on pork fat sabl\u00e9\nTurnip with duck-yolk sauce and kale \u201cnori\u201d\nSalty buttermilk sorbet with sorrel juice\nGrilled bison rib eye with grilled baby cabbage and peach glaze\nSoft scramble tart with black garlic\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlueberry sorbet with lemongrass yogurt\nMint and basil biscotti with herbal tea\nChocolate mint ice cream, pizzelle, and chimichurri\nSourdough baguette with cultured butter, shishito jam, and pickles\nDid other diners realize just how astonishing these dishes were? I was beginning to think not. On the two evenings I dined at Nonesuch, there were a combined total of ten guests. Including me. It got me thinking. What did I see in Nonesuch that others did not? What was keeping people away? Was it the price (around $75 for ten courses)? Was it the in-your-face dishes like grilled chicken hearts or aged duck? Did people find the tasting-menu format pretentious? Did OKC locals even know Nonesuch existed? When I got back to my hotel after that first thrilling dinner, I flipped through the local city magazine\u2019s Best Of issue. Nonesuch wasn\u2019t mentioned anywhere. The magazine\u2019s favorite new restaurant was praised for its cozy environment and large portions. \u201cWhat more could we want?\u201d the last sentence read. Elwell told me about the time he was having dinner with a member of the OKC city council, and when he mentioned Nonesuch, the city official had never heard of the place. \nI fell for OKC. I dug the low-slung brick buildings and the neon signs advertising laundry services and dive bars. I loved the airy art-filled 21c Museum Hotel where I stayed. I saw the same creative energy I see in Houston or Nashville at a new spot called Bar Arbolada, which was bustling with cool kids sipping cucumber daiquiris and cans of ros\u00e9. There was a cultural and culinary buzz beginning to simmer. Could Nonesuch be the restaurant to put OKC, which as far as I could tell was still heavy on steaks and onion burgers, on the national dining map? I\u2019d seen my share of ambitious, inexperienced chefs try to transform tradition-bound restaurant scenes and fail colossally. I had my doubts.\n\n\nYou down with OKC?\n\n\nWelcome to Oklahoma City.\nThe chefs acknowledge the lack of attention they\u2019ve received, but it doesn\u2019t change the way they operate. \u201cIt\u2019s more respectful to a community if you\u2019re not dumbing things down and making everything fried this or fried that,\u201d Wolfe says. \u201cYou have to remember that our state dish is an extra side of ranch dressing.\u201d \nAll it takes is three \npeople who believe in what \nthey do and do it (well) \nwith conviction. It also helps \nif you have someone who sells \na lot of waffles to believe \nin you and back you.\nNonesuch is challenging food for any city. The fact that these chefs have chosen to stay in OKC and not flee to a city like Austin, where many talented local chefs end up, makes it all the more impressive. Their job is to feed people, yes, but I get the sense that they really love changing people\u2019s attitudes about food. \u201cSome folks come in, cross their arms defensively, and want to hate everything,\u201d Wolfe says. \u201cAnd then halfway through the meal they are smiling and laughing with you and really loving it. That\u2019s my favorite thing to witness.\u201d When I asked Stringer about his motivation, he paused for a moment. \u201cIt\u2019s the transformative power of it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou serve a heart dish and a lot of folks roll their eyes or make a face. Then you look over ten minutes later, and they\u2019ve eaten all of it, and they\u2019re beaming. I like that food has that power over people. That\u2019s why I cook.\u201d \n\n\n\nOklahoma City, home to the geodesic Gold Dome\u2026and our No. 1 restaurant\nIf there\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve learned after crisscrossing the country in search of memorable food for almost 20 years, it\u2019s that greatness exists everywhere\u2014it just needs risk-takers to make it happen. \u201cI won\u2019t pretend everyone here gets Nonesuch, but those guys have willed a Michelin-caliber restaurant into reality through passion,\u201d explains Blair Humphreys, a local developer and Nonesuch regular. He\u2019s right. All it takes is three people who believe in what they do and do it (well) with conviction. It also helps if you have someone who sells a lot of waffles to believe in you and back you.\nHow demoralizing must it \nbe to cook the wildly creative \nand compelling food they \nwere knocking out nightly and \nstill not be busy?\nIn the food-media world we tend to cover the same spots. There\u2019s a well-traveled circuit of usual-suspect cities. Each year certain restaurants pop up on everyone\u2019s Best Of lists. And there\u2019s nothing necessarily wrong with that. If a place is great, it\u2019s great, right? Take last year\u2019s No. 1 restaurant on our list, Turkey and\nthe Wolf in New Orleans. We loved it. And so did everyone else. Yes, it was a sandwich place, a bold choice to name the best restaurant in America, but it was in one of the most food-obsessed cities in America. The chef, Mason Hereford, had worked at a standout NOLA spot, and there were already \nlines out the door by the time I checked it out. Nonesuch had none of that going for it.\ncity of neon\nWith signs like these, who wouldn\u2019t \nfall in love with OKC\u2019s retro charm?\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the end of my visit, Stringer drove me around OKC on a 95 degree day in his blue 2001 Dodge Ram truck. The AC was busted and the humid air blew in the windows like a hair dryer. He pointed out local landmarks: the geodesic Gold Dome on Route 66, his favorite Chinese joint, Chow\u2019s, and the old Victorian that housed Nani and started him on the road to Nonesuch, a restaurant whose future I openly worried about. Even more, I was worried about Stringer, Wang, and Wolfe. How demoralizing must it be to cook the wildly creative and compelling food they were knocking out nightly and still not be busy? How did they stay motivated? \u201cSometimes I do get frustrated and ask myself, \u2018Why am I here at 8:30 a.m. when \nI\u2019m cooking for five people tonight?\u2019\u201d Stringer replied. \u201cBut we have to remind ourselves that we\u2019ve gotta make it great every single day.\u201d He paused as we drove by S&B\u2019s, a local chain where he used to flip burgers. \u201cNone of this really makes any sense,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll just have to wait and see what happens.\u201d \n\n\nHow did a 22-seat \ntasting-menu spot from \nthree chefs whom \nno one has ever heard \nof, in a city that no \nnational critic has ever \npaid attention to, \nbecome                       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            America\u2019s best\nnew restaurant? \n\n\nThis time it was a forkful of homemade dan dan noodles. They \nwere tossed with minced fermented turnip greens in a tahini-like pecan sauce, dressed with chili oil, dusted with cucumber powder, and garnished with micro purple basil. It was spicy \nand cooling, confounding in its simplicity, and immensely satisfying\u2014the type of dish that follows you around for years. \nThe taste was unexpected and complex. Whoever made it \nwas a genius.\n\nI was halfway through a ten-course tasting menu in a 22-seat restaurant in a city I\u2019d never set foot in before. It was Thursday, prime time, and the place was all but empty. Dried wild spinach and juniper hung from the wood rafters. Pickles and other jarred kitchen experiments lined the shelves. Car Seat Headrest played on the speakers. There was a host, a server, three chefs, and no menu. I was head over heels but utterly confused. Who cooked \nthis dish? And what the hell was this place? \n\nIt had been three months since I\u2019d set off on my annual cross-country search for the year\u2019s best new restaurants. I\u2019d checked \nout most of the places I was \u201csupposed\u201d to. You know, those \nbuzzy spots run by pedigreed chefs or by cooks who used \nto work for those pedigreed chefs. I\u2019d visited San Francisco, \nLos Angeles, Chicago, and the other noted food cities. I\u2019d \nchecked out the vibrant restaurant scenes in smaller towns \nlike Charleston, South Carolina, and Portland (both of them). \nBut Oklahoma City? In two decades of covering restaurants, \nit had never popped onto my radar. And the chefs? Never \nheard of them. \nReady to jump a flight to OKC?

There\u2019s fire on them, but the flavor of the white oak wood is not the component we want coming through. It\u2019s not barbecue; it\u2019s grilled. We don\u2019t smoke anything. We could if \nwe wanted to, but it wouldn\u2019t be accurate for the regions we \nare representing. There\u2019s not a lot of fusion, there\u2019s not a lot of experimentation. It\u2019s really dead-on. \n\nCertain things don\u2019t work on the fire, like rice. People are \nalways asking, \u201cWhy isn\u2019t there rice with my kebab?\u201d We\u2019re \nlike, \u201cWe can\u2019t do rice!\u201d \n\nWhat we can do is bread. It\u2019s the most representative thing on \nthe menu. In Georgia I discovered this clay-pot oven, known \nas a tone, that made it all the way there from India. We\u2019ve built \none into our hearth here at Maydan. We make a flatbread using recipes from all the cultures put together. It\u2019s not naan, it\u2019s not pita\u2014our bread is unique; nobody else does it like we do. To me it\u2019s the culmination. It\u2019s symbolic, the breaking of bread, in this place where people can come together as equals. \n\n\nMy mom is Lebanese-American, my dad is Italian-American, and I have been cooking and surrounded by food since I was born. My first restaurant, Compass Rose, is all about international street food. But for the second, I wanted a fire. All of those squares, those maydans, have fire. I wanted the restaurant to give you that feeling of winding through a market, like you\u2019re in the medina in Fez, Morocco. It\u2019s a little chaotic, but it\u2019s happy chaos.\n\nSo I linked up with Chris Morgan and Gerald Addison, my\nco-executive chefs, who\u2019ve both worked extensively with fire cooking. As we were talking, we realized we had a love for Middle Eastern food above all else. This led to a five-country\ntrip, which started in Morocco, went on to Tunisia, then Georgia, Lebanon, and Turkey.\n\nYou come into the restaurant, and it\u2019s really quiet, and you\u2019re just \nin the vestibule covered with textiles. It feels a little like Alice in Wonderland. There are steps and doors and you\u2019re like, Which way do I go? But then you open the main door, and there it is:\nthe hearth. And you instantly feel something: surprise, shock, horror, happiness\u2014it doesn\u2019t matter, you feel something. It\u2019s an experience. Everything in the restaurant is meaningful. Everything has a story.\n\nThere\u2019s no stove, no range. Everything is cooked on the hearth, which has a mammoth hood covered in copper. The fire is so big and so intense that these guys are sweating through their shirts \nin five minutes. I don\u2019t think we want it to be tamed; it\u2019s just about managing it.

And it always means the same thing: a central public meeting place. A space for people to come together as a community, to mourn, to celebrate, to rebel. People in these places have drastic income disparities, but there\u2019s always street food that everybody loves and that\u2019s representative of the culture. The poor people eat there and the rich people eat there. It\u2019s an equalizer. A maydan brings everyone together over a common emotion. And that is powerful. \n\n\nPhotographs by\nIt took a trip halfway around the world to design the \nlive-fire hearth at the center of this Middle Eastern restaurant. \nBut it takes only one meal\u2014and a couple hours staring longingly \nat the huge hearth and all the charred meats and puffy \nbread coming off it\u2014to realize why it was so worth it.

Warm water, beer, and milk help too.\u201d \n\nWhen All Else Fails, Eat a Cucumber\n\u201cThai food is about cooking\nwith patience. My best memory of my dad cooking is him\npounding curry paste because nobody else could make it\nthe way he wanted. He pounded all day, for hours and hours. Here at Ugly Baby, we make our curry paste the way my dad did: with a mortar and pestle.\u201d\n5\nA Mortar and Pestle Takes Time, and That\u2019s the Point\n4\n\u201cNot only is the heat from different chiles \ndifferent, but each ingredient in a dish\u2014 cumin, \npepper, garlic, turmeric, galangal\u2014complements \nthe spiciness and adds flavor little by little. \nWhen they are combined, it\u2019s like a bomb.\u201d \nHeat and Flavor\nGo Hand in Hand\n3\n\u201cThai food stands out because of how generous we are with flavor. I don\u2019t hold \nback. If it\u2019s too spicy, add more sugar. If \nit\u2019s too sweet, add more fish sauce or chile. Cool, crunchy herbs and veggies balance heat. It\u2019s never a matter of too much flavor; \nit\u2019s about adding more to balance everything.\u201d\nMore Is More\n\u201cWe use bird chiles because we follow the\nrules of the great-grandmothers and -grandfathers.\nWe already know what is good. I don\u2019t see\nanything that can replace them. Fresh, ripe red Thai\nbird chiles release the best aroma and flavor. We\nalso sometimes use the bigger cayenne chile pepper\nfor texture and color but not really for flavor.\u201d\n2\nBird Chiles Are the Only\nFresh Chiles That Matter\n1\nGET THE RECIPE\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my belief that curry\npaste is the key to Thai cooking.\nIt is the base of almost all my dishes. Thai cooking has\nadopted so many methods from so many different cuisines\n from China, from Myanmar, from Thai Muslims, today from Koreans, from the Japanese. But the key to Thai cuisine, if we strip all that off, is the paste.

His goal from the start has been to introduce New Yorkers to what he calls \u201creal Thai cooking.\u201d \n\u201cThai food is not about doing it fast,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s about low heat and spending time stirring and stirring, sometimes for hours.\u201d\n\nThe process of opening his own restaurant wasn\u2019t easy; the chef spent a year searching for a space and looking for a loan. When he finally succeeded, he named the place Ugly Baby after an old Thai superstition: calling newborns unattractive so that the evil spirits will leave them alone. \u201cThis restaurant is my ugly baby,\u201d says Sreparplarn. \u201cIt\u2019s everything to me, but I\u2019m always afraid \nI\u2019m going to lose it.\u201d \nReported by\nHILARY CADIGAN        chris morocco\nHow Ugly Baby chef Sirichai Sreparplarn handles the heat\nIngredients for red curry paste\nFresh bird chiles\nand\n\n\nHOT TEN\n2018\n\n1 \u2013 NONESUCH\n2 \u2013 MAYDAN\n3 \u2013 UGLY BABY\n4 \u2013 FREEDMAN\u2019S\n5 \u2013 NYUM BAI\n6 \u2013 NIMBLEFISH\n7 \u2013 CHE FICO\n8 \u2013 YUME GA ARUKARA\n9 \u2013 DRIFTERS WIFE\n10 \u2013 CALL\n1 \u2013 NONESUCH\n2 \u2013 MAYDAN\n3 \u2013 UGLY BABY\n4 \u2013 FREEDMAN\u2019S\n5 \u2013 NYUM BAI\n6 \u2013 NIMBLEFISH\n7 \u2013 CHE FICO\n8 \u2013 YUME GA ARUKARA\n9 \u2013 DRIFTERS WIFE\n10 \u2013 CALL\nHOT TEN\nHOT TEN\nNO.\n4\n\nFREEDMAN\u2019S\nLOS ANGELES\nGenius is when you take a timeless concept, turn it on \nits head, and redefine it. That\u2019s what sibling restaurateurs\nJonah and Amanda Freedman have done for the classic\nJewish deli: They improved an already perfect thing. Here,\nJonah breaks down every careful detail, from the latkes \nto the lavatory\nPhotographs by\nALEX LAU\n                                                                         Because we\u2019re \nnot really a deli. We don\u2019t do stuff by the pound, we have \nliquor, and we\u2019re open a little later. Other modern delis \nhave popped up, but a lot of them were just changing the \ndeli aesthetic, going light and bright\u2014minimalist design with subway tile. They weren\u2019t looking at the food and saying, \n\u201cWhere can we innovate? Where can we bring this idea of Jewish food to another level?\u201d That\u2019s where we got excited.\n\nWe didn\u2019t want the food to become sentimental or nostalgic. \nI grew up going to delis with my grandfather in Toronto. Sour pickles are staples of Jewish cooking, but I find them boring. \nThus, the half-sour salad was born. It\u2019s avocado, fennel, and green goddess dressing. Our latkes are done in a waffle \niron. Our brisket is served with bone marrow\u2014which just \npushes it in a more French direction. We have a lot of French customers, actually. I think it\u2019s because they realize that we\u2019re secretly a French restaurant masquerading as a Jewish deli.\nWe\u2019re the black sheep of Jewish delis.\n\nCO-OWNER JONAH FREEDMAN\nThere\u2019s a culture of delis in L.A. In the summer of 2016 I was \nat Langer\u2019s with my sister. We were sitting there, looking \naround, realizing that this place was about to close and it \nwas four o\u2019clock in the afternoon. We said to each other, \n\u201cWhat if this place were a little younger, a little cooler, had \nsome great music playing, and a menu geared toward a \nmore modern customer? And what if we could access it at \nten o\u2019clock at night? What would that look like?\u201d And that\u2019s \nkind of where everything started from.\n\nThe brass, the French sconces from 1910 Paris, the Morris & \nCo. wallpaper, the tank on the toilet that\u2019s decorated with \n24-karat gold-leaf trim\u2026it\u2019s a little f*#% you to restaurants \nthat were clean and spare with pure white walls. I wanted to \nfill everything. Our bar is made from an old hearth we found. \nA local tattoo artist, Aron Dubois, did our logo. Our napkins have an illustration of a flamingo drinking a martini; it\u2019s a \nlittle bit Miami. The idea is: Okay, what if young people took \nover a grandma\u2019s house and made it cool? \n\u2014JONAH FREEDMAN\nIT\u2019S ALL IN THE DETAILS\nThere\u2019s a story behind every plate, pickle, and pipe \n(yes, pipe) at Freedman\u2019s. Jonah Freedman tells us a few of them\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE MATZO BALLS\n\u201cWe wanted them superlight and airy. I think \n[former L.A. Times critic] Jonathan Gold called them quenelles. Rather than one hulking thing, there\u2019s \na dozen or so. It\u2019s a nicer, more palatable soup experience. We serve them in Luminarc Amberline cookware we found in Koreatown.\u201d \nTHE ROTARY TELEPHONE\n\u201cIt has a dial tone. The idea is, if you don\u2019t have \nyour phone, you can make a call. Similar to Cheers, \nyou can receive a call at the bar. I would love if \none of the employees answered the phone and went into the dining room and called out to someone. \nIt\u2019ll happen one day.\u201d\n\nTHE CHAIRS\n\u201cWe have wicker chairs and Modernica chairs; we\u2019re mixing different eras throughout the restaurant. Because your grandparents, as they go through time, they collect things. And all of these eras exist at once.\u201d\n\nTHE ELECTRIC KNIFE\n \u201cThis is our super-strange version of high-low. The brisket is sliced tableside, but it\u2019s not a particularly nice cut of meat. Not only that, but it\u2019s cut with our \u2018dad knife,\u2019 which is just a battery-operated Waring.\u201d\n\nIF THESE WALLPAPERS COULD TALK...\n\u201cRather than selecting one single wallpaper to cover the entire restaurant, the aim was to create different spaces and dining experiences with each new wall,\u201d says Freedman. For example:\nTHE REUBEN\n\u201cWe hired Liz Johnson as our opening chef. We were like, Hey, you\u2019re super non-Jewish, and \nwe\u2019re going to have you make briskets and Reubens. We swap the traditional corned beef for our pastrami, which is brined and smoked in-house.\u201d\n\u201cThe color, the light stitching of the leather\u2014\nit\u2019s inspired by Herm\u00e8s watches. We had them custom made.\u201d\nTHE BATHROOM\n\u201cThe porcelain is hand-painted in 24-karat \ngold-leaf trim. As for the gold plumbing \non the urinal, that was incredibly hard to get \nour hands on. That was deep web.\u201d\nTHE BAR\n\u201cDelis were a place to sit and talk. That\u2019s a \nhuge part of our bar. It\u2019s made from an old \n1940s fireplace mantel that we found in L.A. \nI know it\u2019s cheesy and everyone talks about \nthe hearth, but that\u2019s where people meet.\u201d\n\nTHE PICKLES\n\u201cThe pickles are made in-house, the sauerkraut \nis made in-house, the pumpernickel bread for \nthe happy hour toast is made in-house. All the bagels are hand rolled and made in-house.\u201d \n\nTHE BRISKET\n\u201cOur brisket is done like Jewish-Texas \nbarbecue, with loads of tarragon on top, \nbraised for hours. You get rye bread, you \nget pickles, and the idea is that you create \nthis massive sandwich out of everything.\u201d\n\n\nThe Bathroom\n\u201cThe wall opposite the bathrooms is left blank. This is meant to kind of clear your visual palette for the moment before you enter the bathroom and see the amazing \n\nIt\u2019s vibrant, fun, confusing. It\u2019s like Boca Raton meets M.C. Escher.\u201d\nThe Banquettes\n\u201cThe wallpaper along the banquet is a \n\nIt seemed like a nice everyday wallpaper: not too dark, but had enough patterning to feel cozy and intimate at night, like a well-worn British country home. The many browns, tans, and oranges play off the saddle-like cognac leather cushions.\u201d\nThe Bar\nThe bar area is filled with richer, \ndarker tones: browns and burnt orange.\n It feels a little more like a speakeasy: dimmer, boozier. The wallpaper used along the bar to create that kind of Prohibition-esque atmosphere is a \nThe Dividing Wall\n\u201cThe wall that separates the kitchen from \nthe dining room is clad in                            \n                              . This took double the time \nto install than all the newly manufactured wallpaper did. It was like trying to put up newspaper. It was thin and delicate and \nhad to be done with a very gentle hand. \nThe background is a kind of burgundy color, and the flowers are grayish-white, which play off the marble counter below.\u201d\nThe Hallway\n\u201cReinforcing the bird theme that\u2019s \npresent through the restaurant, we selected the                                                              \n                                . It depicts perched birds \nwith strawberries in their mouths. It\u2019s a relatively light scene but has dark greens and browns that complement the dark green wainscoting below. The color scheme seems kind of country club to me.\u201d\nTHE LATKES\n\u201cWe shred the potatoes, put them in the waffle iron, freeze them, then fry them. The outside gets crispy and renders the inside soft and mashed potato-y. It\u2019s like molten chocolate cake.\u201d\n\nTHE BANQUETTES\n\n\nCole & Son print called Miami\n Morris & Co. print called Golden Lily \n\n\n\n\n\n\n Morris & Co. print called Compton. \n1940s deadstock \n\n floral wallpaper\nMorris & Co. wallpaper called \n Strawberry Thief\nReported by\n MICKEY RAPKIN\n\n\n\n.\n.\nHOT TEN\n2018\n\n\n1 \u2013 NONESUCH\n2 \u2013 MAYDAN\n3 \u2013 UGLY BABY\n4 \u2013 FREEDMAN\u2019S\n5 \u2013 NYUM BAI\n6 \u2013 NIMBLEFISH\n7 \u2013 CHE FICO\n8 \u2013 YUME GA ARUKARA\n9 \u2013 DRIFTERS WIFE\n10 \u2013 CALL\n1 \u2013 NONESUCH\n2 \u2013 MAYDAN\n3 \u2013 UGLY BABY\n4 \u2013 FREEDMAN\u2019S\n5 \u2013 NYUM BAI\n6 \u2013 NIMBLEFISH\n7 \u2013 CHE FICO\n8 \u2013 YUME GA ARUKARA\n9 \u2013 DRIFTERS WIFE\n10 \u2013 CALL\nHOT TEN\nHOT TEN\nThings may get messy, but Nyum Bai is prepared.\n\n\nNyum Bai\u2019s tables are laden with condiments like sugar and \nchili sauce for adding extra flavor\u2014if you need it.\nTHE FISH-PASTE-FILLED DIP\nTHAT TASTES (AND SMELLS!)\nLIKE MY CHILDHOOD\n\nTHE PORK CHOP THAT\nBRINGS BACK A GOLDEN ERA\n\n\u2014ROSE PREVITE\nI was born in a refugee camp in Thailand after \nmy parents fled the genocide in Cambodia in the 1970s. I was two years old when I came to the States. But even though I had never been to Cambodia, I was still connected to the country because of the stories I heard growing up.\n    I always had this longing to go\u2014well, I want \nto say go \u201cback\u201d to Cambodia since it felt so familiar to me. The first time I went back, I had just dropped out of nursing school after realizing it wasn\u2019t for me. I was 23 or 24. It was so trippy. Everywhere I went I was like, Wow, these are all the foods I grew up eating. \n    This noodle soup dish, listed on the menu as kuy teav Phnom Penh, is what inspired me to start Nyum Bai. It\u2019s the soup my mom would prepare for me  \n\n\nTHE NOODLE SOUP\nTHAT STARTED IT ALL\n\n\n\nPhotographs by \nAt her deeply personal restaurant in the East Bay, Nite Yun reimagines the Cambodian food of her childhood, from soulful bowls of Cambodian noodle soup to flavorful marinated pork chops, all set to a psychedelic Khmer playlist. Here are three dishes that transport Yun back in time\nOAKLAND\nNYUM BAI\nNO.\n5\n\nALEX LAU\nReported by\nHILARY CADIGAN\nand my brothers on weekends. There are three \nmain parts: rich broth, rice noodles, and meat toppings. Then the garnishes: crispy garlic, black pepper, cilantro, green onions, and lime. When \nI was in Phnom Penh, I started my mornings eating \nit at my favorite noodle stall. That\u2019s where I had \nmy epiphany. Halfway through eating the soup, \nI started thinking, Oh my gosh, this is so good, but \nno one in America knows about it. If people know anything about Cambodia, it\u2019s the genocide. But in Phnom Penh life was just happening all around me. People had moved on from the war; they were living, celebrating, having a good time. Cambodia has such a rich and beautiful history. And I thought people needed to know more about Cambodian food because it is so damn good. \nThis simple marinated pork chop with rice, bai sach chrouk, reminds me of my childhood. My mom would marinate the pork overnight in coconut milk, soy sauce, and garlic, and then my brothers and \nI would come home from school, pan-fry it ourselves, and eat it with rice. If we wanted, we could put an egg on top. As far as I can remember, back to five or six years old, I was always in the kitchen with my mom. I didn\u2019t realize I was learning how to cook, but I helped her cut vegetables or pound lemongrass because I really didn\u2019t have anywhere to go. \n    Growing up, we were isolated from the community. I think my parents were just shocked when they arrived in America. They didn\u2019t know what to do; they didn\u2019t speak the language. It was very difficult for them to assimilate. After the refugee camp in Thailand, we moved to Texas for a few \n\nmonths and  then to Stockton, California, where there was a bigger Cambodian community. \nWe lived in an apartment complex with a lot of other Cambodian families, but we kind of stayed \nto ourselves.\n    My parents don\u2019t talk much about Cambodia; \nthe memories are just too painful. But the time they talk about most is the carefree \u201960s and early \u201970s, the golden era, when Cambodia was a happening country and all of the artists and the musicians would go to Phnom Penh to make music, to be part of the scene. \n    All that was taken away from them by the regime. I wanted to bring that back\u2014the scene, the music, the color palette, even the name Nyum Bai (which means \u201ceat rice\u201d). I wanted to have my parents\u2019 generation and the younger generations celebrate this time and hopefully heal as well. \n\nWhen I was young, my house always smelled \nlike prahok, a really flavorful fermented fish paste \nthat\u2019s the base for a lot of classic Cambodian dishes. But I was so used to it that I didn\u2019t know \nuntil people would come over and be like, \u201cDamn, your house really smells.\u201d My mom would take the fermented fish and chop it up with a cleaver until \nit was really minced. I remember the smell of cutting lemongrass, mixing it in with the garlic and shallots and lime leaves. \n\n\n\nTo make prahok ktiss, she would stir-fry the paste with pork belly and let it simmer so the fat would incorporate with all the other flavors and create \nthis thick creamy dip for raw veggies. It\u2019s time-consuming, so my mom would make it only for special occasions: birthdays, celebrations, temple visits. I was hesitant to put this on the menu at first because it was so different and weird, but all the customers who have tried it have come back just \nto order it. \n\u2013NITE YUN\n                           a compilation of Khmer rock music from the \u201960s and \u201970s, curated and remastered by Rattanak Oudam of the Cambodian Vintage Music Archive.

That fat adds a major boost to the flavor.\u201d \n\u201cGizzard shad is one of the\noldest sushi being made today \nin the Edomae style of sushi \n(a 200-year-old tradition of curing or cooking fish before serving). \nThe shad is heavily salted for \n30 minutes, then rinsed with vinegar, then rested in a vinegar marinade for another 30 minutes.\u201d\n\u201cThe menu starts with freshly boiled octopus from a market in Fukuoka, Japan, which we wrap in nori and serve atop vinegar-washed Calrose rice. Our rice is a little bit saltier and more robust in flavor, so we don\u2019t have to rely on too many condiments for seasoning the fish.\u201d\nTREVALLY JACK MACKEREL\nSHIMA-AJI\nSOY-MARINATED TUNA\nMAGURO ZUKE\nYELLOW-STRIPED BUTTERFISH\nTAKABE\nSMOKED KING SALMON\nSMOKED SAKE\nROLLED OMELET\nTAMAGO\nGIZZARD SHAD\nKOHADA\nSTAR SNAPPER\nFUEFUKI-DAI\nSHORT-SPINED SEA URCHIN\nBAFUN UNI\nATLANTIC SALMON\nSAKE\nOREGON DUNGENESS CRAB\nKANI\nSCALLOP\nHOTATE\nOCTOPUS\nTAKO\n\n\n\nImpeccably sourced fish, perfectly seasoned rice, and\nrelentless attention to detail define every bite at this\ntranscendent sushi bar.

It takes us about 45 minutes per day to make the omelets.\u201d\n\u201cScallops will always be better \nthe fresher and better quality \nyou can get. We source scallops from Hokkaido, Japan, through \na relationship I built with a fish purveyor while working at \nprevious restaurants.\u201d\n\u201cWe get a live, local Dungeness crab. We boil it, clean it, and shell it, then we take the crab innards, or the kani-miso, and toss that in with the crabmeat. We wrap all of that meat in nori and serve it.\u201d\n\u201cThis is a sustainably farmed Atlantic salmon from Victoria, B.C. Because we want the sourcing to really shine, we keep the preparation minimal. We\u2019ll only do a traditional 30-minute salt-and-vinegar cure on the salmon. We\u2019ll dress it with a finishing clump of grated daikon.\u201d\n\u201cPeople are falling in love \nwith uni all over, not just in sushi. Like most sushi, the secret to uni lies in who your source is. I have a great source for this in Japan. We wrap it in nori and serve it. The result is a briny piece of sushi that ends very sweet.\u201d\n\u201cFuefuki-dai is a really\n prized shiromi, or whitefish: It\u2019s one of the nicest whitefish you can possibly get. We lightly salt everything on the skin side and let it sweat a little bit. By pulling out the water, we\u2019re also concentrating the flavor. We\u2019ll age the fish for eight to ten days, serve it cool, and top it with wasabi.\u201d\n\u201cThis is a very classic \nEdomae preservation of tuna. We cook the outside of the \nfish with hot water and marinate it in a soy-based marinade for 20 to 30 minutes. It will continue to marinate after we pull it out, so we don\u2019t want to do it for too long.\u201d\n\u201cThis fish is fairly rare to see \nin the wild. Most restaurants source theirs from year-round aquaculture farms in Japan, but we prefer ours wild-caught and in-season. We wash it with salt and top it with grated ginger.\u201d\nPhotographs by\nALEX LAU\nReported by\nJesse Sparks\n\n\n\n\nANY WAY YOU SLICE IT\nMore scenes from Nimblefish\nHanging at the table before the sushi arrives at Nimblefish, a joint collaboration of chefs Cody Auger and Dwight Rosendahl and wine guru Kurt Heilemann.\nChef Cody Auger preps short-grain Calrose rice for service in a hangiri, a rounded, flat-bottomed wooden tub used for rice-making.\nWant a chance to watch Auger\u2019s agile knifework in action? \nThe bar seats are the best in the house.\nAuger slices through yet another gleaming piece of fish.\n\n\nHOT TEN\n2018\n\n1 \u2013 NONESUCH\n2 \u2013 MAYDAN\n3 \u2013 UGLY BABY\n4 \u2013 FREEDMAN\u2019S\n5 \u2013 NYUM BAI\n6 \u2013 NIMBLEFISH\n7 \u2013 CHE FICO\n8 \u2013 YUME GA ARUKARA\n9 \u2013 DRIFTERS WIFE\n10 \u2013 CALL\n1 \u2013 NONESUCH\n2 \u2013 MAYDAN\n3 \u2013 UGLY BABY\n4 \u2013 FREEDMAN\u2019S\n5 \u2013 NYUM BAI\n6 \u2013 NIMBLEFISH\n7 \u2013 CHE FICO\n8 \u2013 YUME GA ARUKARA\n9 \u2013 DRIFTERS WIFE\n10 \u2013 CALL\nHOT TEN\nHOT TEN\nNO.\n7\n\n\nCHE FICO\nSAN FRANCISCO\nDoes America need another Italian restaurant? If that restaurant \nis Che Fico, the answer is a definitive yes. From practically the moment it opened, this place has been humming like a restaurant \nin its second decade.

So I looked at one of my sous-chefs, and I was like, I\u2019ll put lobster on it. \nThe next day we sold 40 of them.

Here\u2019s what goes into this profound bowl\n\nPhotographs by\nElizabeth Cecil\n\nit was because that was the only thing I craved. Then I went \nto Setouchi Seimen in Osaka, one of the more famous udon restaurants in Japan, and that really changed it for me. I only wanted to eat udon. Specifically niku [beef] udon. \n\nUdon is very simple\u2014flour, water, and salt\u2014but it requires so much technique and talent to make so that the noodle isn\u2019t too hard or too soft. It should be bouncy. A few years ago, I asked the owner of Setouchi Seimen to teach me. I worked from early morning to late at night, mixing the dough, stomping it with my feet to flatten it out, and then stretching and pressing it to make \nit smoother. \nIt\u2019s not easy to find this classroom-like setup inside Lesley University, but Nishioka has developed \na loyal following of college students, local families, and noodle obsessives.\nOnce I got back, I considered closing Yume Wo Katare temporarily one summer and starting an udon shop. I love udon that much. If I want to eat something else, I\u2019ll just stop making \nit and move on. I only serve what I want to eat. Then I found this space\u2014and got a $35,000 udon noodle-making machine straight from Japan. It\u2019s the same one I used at Setouchi Seimen. \n\nWhenever I make udon, I get this feeling, like when you find the person you like. It\u2019s hard to say, but it just gives me goose bumps. Every day I eat about four bowls of niku udon. Minimum. I\u2019m always thinking about how to create the best tasting version. And every day it gets better, so I never get tired of it.\u201d \n\n\u2014Tsuyoshi Nishioka\nLead cook Tomohiro Shinoda examines each strand carefully. \nHe hopes to open his own noodle shop in Seattle some day.\nChef-owner Tsuyoshi Nishioka takes his niku udon seriously\u2014but himself less so.\nTHE PERFECT BOWL\nChef Tsuyoshi Nishioka breaks down his unforgettable niku udon\nNoodles\nNori\nScallions\nBroth\nBeef\nLemon\nGrated Daikon\nNoodles\nNori\nScallions\nBroth\nBeef\nLemon\nGrated Daikon\nCome right when the restaurant opens and you\u2019ll get a glimpse of Nishioka churning out noodles with a $35,000 machine from Japan. He\u2019s constantly tweaking the dough to mimic the one \nat Setouchi Seimen in Osaka. Right now it\u2019s made with Australian udon flour, Japanese \nsea salt, and local Cambridge tap water, which, once softened, is similar to Japan\u2019s supply.\nNishioka scatters crisp slivers of nori over the bowl; they cling to the noodles and balance \nout the soy-slicked meat.\n\u201cScallions just make things taste better,\u201d Nishioka says, plus they\u2019re nutritious (fiber! vitamin A!), which is \nwhy he heaps them on.\nThe secret to this \numami-rich chilled broth? Two types of bonito flakes\u2014katsuobushi (skipjack) and sababushi (mackerel).\nThinly sliced rib eye, similar to shabu-shabu, is simmered in a bit of soy sauce, water, and sugar. Then the beefy cooking liquid is reduced and the beef is dunked into it a second time to reheat before going on top of the cold noodles.\nSqueeze it over the beef, Nishioka instructs, \nto balance out the savoriness of the meat with some acidity.\nNishioka thinks \nabout his udon in layers, and this cooling pile \nof grated daikon complements the fishy broth, meaty beef, \nand bracing scallion \nand lemon to make \nthe perfect bowl.\nReported by\nElyse Inamine\n\n\u201cWhen I first opened my ramen shop, Yume Wo Katare, \n\n\n\nHOT TEN\n2018\n\n1 \u2013 NONESUCH\n2 \u2013 MAYDAN\n3 \u2013 UGLY BABY\n4 \u2013 FREEDMAN\u2019S\n5 \u2013 NYUM BAI\n6 \u2013 NIMBLEFISH\n7 \u2013 CHE FICO\n8 \u2013 YUME GA ARUKARA\n9 \u2013 DRIFTERS WIFE\n10 \u2013 CALL\n1 \u2013 NONESUCH\n2 \u2013 MAYDAN\n3 \u2013 UGLY BABY\n4 \u2013 FREEDMAN\u2019S\n5 \u2013 NYUM BAI\n6 \u2013 NIMBLEFISH\n7 \u2013 CHE FICO\n8 \u2013 YUME GA ARUKARA\n9 \u2013 DRIFTERS WIFE\n10 \u2013 CALL\nHOT TEN\nHOT TEN\nNO.\n9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDRIFTERS WIFE\nPORTLAND, ME\nThere\u2019s no better place on the planet to drink natural wine \nthan right here. How did Brooklyn transplants Orenda and Peter Hale go from running a little bottle shop to transforming their \ntown, glass by glass and dish by dish?\nPhotographs by\nELIZABETH CECIL\n\nNatural Progression\nThe very winding road to Drifters Wife\nAugust 2014\nAfter working at New York City restaurants\n\u2014including                                and                                \u2014for a decade, Orenda and Peter Hale decide to get out of town. They dream of doing their own thing: a little caf\u00e9. On a whim they head to Portland, Maine, new and unfamiliar turf for both of them. \n                    Reynard, Diner,        Marlow\n& Sons\nJanuary 2015\nAs they settle into the community, the Hales run into a problem:              \n                                              They fell in love with natural wine back in New York, so they\ndecide to go into retail instead. They convince their favorite importers (SelectioNaturel, Louis/Dressner) to sell them bottles previously unavailable in the state. The Hales open their wine shop, Maine & Loire.\n                                There are no natural wine shops in Portland!\nHerb-Rubbed Cast-Iron Chicken with Pan Sauce\n\u201cAdding a weight [on top of the bird] renders more fat and produces an extremely crisp skin. People have been cooking chicken this way forever, so \nit\u2019s not as if I\u2019m doing anything new. \nI use what I have [to weigh it down], and that just so happens to be a beautiful rock I found while snorkeling off the Maine coast.\u201d\nGET THE RECIPE\n\nSeptember 2015\nFunky, pricier natural wines prove to be \na hard sell in Portland. So the Hales figure the only way to get locals into it is by popping open the bottles to try with a few snacks.                                                                       \n                         , installing an eight-seat counter, a few tables, and a tiny kitchen outfitted with two induction burners, an electric oven, and a lowboy fridge. The Hales call Ben Jackson, a former sous-chef at Reynard, and his wife, Alexis, a front-of-house veteran, with a proposition: \u201cMove to Portland and work for us.\u201d \n             They move the wine racks to the back of the shop and open Drifters\nWife up front\nEggplant with Cashew Butter and Pickled Peppers\n\u201cI love lamb shawarma, and \nthis eggplant dish is inspired by it, flavor-wise. We hard-roast the eggplant to replicate the char on the outside of the meat, and the cashew butter is the \u2018white sauce.\u2019\u201d\n \u2014Ben jackson, CHEF\nGET THE RECIPE\n\nJanuary 2016\nAfter one whirlwind visit the Jacksons fall \nin love with Portland and soon start working at Drifters Wife, with \n                                  Alexis as a server and Ben as chef.\nDecember 2017\nBen conjures up a new menu every \nday at Drifters Wife based on what he gets from his farmers and what won\u2019t fit in his fridge (though the crisp-skinned half chicken shows up on the menu most nights). And the Hales change the by-the-glass list nearly as often. Their landlord offers them the vacant restaurant next door to the shop and construction begins on Drifters Wife 2.0.\nNapa Cabbage Salad with Parmesan and Pistachios\n\u201cI spend a lot of time staring at produce in the walk-in. One time, \nI ordered way too much cabbage \nand spent all morning pacing, trying \nto figure out how to make it go away. So, I made this fresh salad out of it, with vinegars I made myself from leftover wine, which isn\u2019t hard to pull off and just superior as a product.\u201d\nGET THE RECIPE\n\nFebruary 2018\nAfter a winter renovation by local wood shop Joiya Studios, the Hales and Jacksons debut the new Drifters Wife. It houses both the wine shop, located at the entrance and sectioned off by black-paneled walls, and the new restaurant, with 60 seats, a bottle list in addition to the by-the-glass one, a six-burner range with a convection oven, a real walk-in fridge, and a Spanish-style plancha for Ben to experiment with. But he still uses the old induction burners, and the team works the same: Ben cooks whatever he \nlikes and the Hales pour whatever they like.\n\n                        Bon App\u00e9tit\u2019s best \nnew restaurants of 2018.\nAugust 2018\nWell, here we are.
