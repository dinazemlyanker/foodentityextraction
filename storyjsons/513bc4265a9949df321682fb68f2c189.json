But c\u2019mon, these are nature\u2019s Gushers! Gimme that sweet jelly! Let\u2019s show some love to the little guys.We\u2019ve been on this September-is-the-best-time-to-eat kick, and right now, tomatoes are sweet, juicy, and practically glowing with ripeness (or maybe that\u2019s the UV lens in our sunglasses). Pick up 2-27 pints of cherry tomatoes, especially candy-like Sun Golds if you spot them, and make this burst cherry tomato sauce. Every bite is an explosion of fun\u2014if this were a cereal commercial that would be the tagline and then a little tomato would blow up on the screen.Y ThoBecause it\u2019s very easy. Creator Molly Baz describes this recipe as \u201cdump some stuff in a pot, let the heat do its work, tossy toss, cheese.\u201d Molly Baz, pasta poet.The stuff you dump in a pot is a ton of olive oil (Molly: \u201cTell them it\u2019s good for the Mediterranean diet!\u201d Okay), garlic, basil, and then the tomatoes. The burst part comes in when you simmer the tomatoes, untouched, until they begin to burst open, and then cook them a little longer (10 minutes or so) to transform into a sauce. Different sizes of tomatoes mean they\u2019ll break down at different rates, so you have varied textures in the final sauce \u201ca good mix of saucy and bursty,\u201d notes our poet. The \u201cton of olive oil\u201d is not a cute suggestion, it\u2019s necessary for this recipe to work. The highly acidic tomatoes need a lot of fat in order to emulsify into a glossy sauce that coats the pasta. \u201cThey need something to cling to,\u201d Molly says looking off into the distance wistfully.The tomatoes, about midway through the cooking process.\nPhoto by Chelsie Craig, Food Styling by Anna BillingskogWhat About Grape TomatoesNOOOOOOOO. We HATE them. Did you read the unnecessary food feud of the week in the newsletter a few weeks back? Grape tomatoes have a taut, tough skin and they\u2019re never sweet. They\u2019re like the Red Delicious of tomatoes. HARD PASS. If you can\u2019t find cherry tomatoes, this recipe works with regular tomatoes (cut into smaller pieces), which will break down in the same time, without the Explosion of Fun factor.Use the Good ParmThere are so few ingredients in this recipe, please use the real stuff, which should have PARMIGIANO-REGGIANO on the rind. (Or try one of these cheaper substitutes!)Use a \u201cStabby\u201d Pasta ShapesLike these ruffled campanelle, or whatever shape looks fun to you. Something you can stab with a fork in order to get tomato bombs in as many bites as possible. We really thought this through.A Nice AnecdoteThis recipe was inspired by a meal that Molly ate when she studied abroad in Florence in college and lived with an Italian widow named Graziella. Every single day\u2014and no this isn\u2019t a screenplay, yet\u2014Graziella went to the market and cooked for hours until Molly came home from school. \u201cEvery night I had to eat like, a Tuscan Thanksgiving dinner amount of food,\u201d remembers Molly with absolute joy. At the time, Molly was studying art history, but the feasts Graziella made, and taught Molly how to make, steered her interest into cooking. This simple sauce was one of her go-tos. And now it\u2019s ours too.Get the recipe:Burst Cherry Tomato PastaA simple sauce of juicy, bursty cherry tomatoes (aka nature\u2019s Gushers) that comes together in around 15 minutes.View RecipeMore of Molly\u2019s Pasta Moves:Explore Bon App\u00e9titPastaCherry TomatoSummerWeeknightRecipes you want to make.
