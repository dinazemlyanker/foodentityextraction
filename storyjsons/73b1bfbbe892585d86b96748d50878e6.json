Generally on the stove by the time I walked in the door from school, the last meal of the day was a welcome smell and sight in those mid-afternoon hours when my lackluster cafeteria lunch was a distant memory and my stomach was beginning to grumble. By 4 p.m., when most of my friends were eating Doritos or Dunkaroos on the couch and watching MTV, I was sitting at the dining room table eating my dinner, and frankly, I preferred it that way.Of course, this practice isn\u2019t possible for everyone. I\u2019m a full-time writer and editor with the luxury of working from home, which means I can grab meals between tasks without much interruption to my schedule. Since I start work earlier and end later than the typical 9-to-5 hours, I\u2019m back at my computer once dinner\u2019s done rather than using the meal to punctuate another day done. Most adults have jobs that keep them out of the house until well after five or six in the evening. This means that dinner times are getting later, and we\u2019re spending less time cooking and eating our meals, as people are opting for fast food and pre-prepped meals due to childcare and work commitments. With these considerations in mind, the idea of a 4 p.m. dinner seems a dream at best and downright laughable at worst.Still, for those who can swing it, there are plenty of well-documented benefits to eating your last meal earlier in the day rather than later at night. Not only has it been proven to be beneficial for weight loss and management, but you\u2019re also likely to sleep better since your body has had time to digest the food you ate hours prior. Research has found that people who eat earlier benefit from better heart health than those who don\u2019t chow down until later at night. None of these factors are my primary motivator for eating early, nor do I think they factored into my mother\u2019s decision for us to do so when I was a kid, but they\u2019re certainly welcome bonuses.Of course, a penchant for late afternoon meals does come with a few social complications. I can\u2019t always do it when I\u2019m meeting up with friends, since most dinner dates are understandably held after office hours. I\u2019m always a little cranky and over-hungry by then, but I make do. It\u2019s also a no-go on the days that I\u2019m not working from home, as the expectation is that you\u2019ll get dinner when the work day is done (though I tend to eat lunch at \u201cnormal\u201d hours, around noon, even when I\u2019m working from my apartment). Those circumstances aren\u2019t ideal, but they\u2019re rare enough that nine times out of 10, dinner is a distant memory by the start of primetime TV.One of the biggest arguments I get from people when I tell them about my preference to eat before 5 p.m. is that I must go to bed starving since I ate so long ago. I eat generous meals with healthy portions of foods that are filling, nutritious, and keep me going just fine until morning. On the rare occasions that I do feel a bit peckish before bed, I drink a glass of water or herbal tea. While I\u2019m not against the occasional handful of M&Ms after lunch, I\u2019m generally full enough from my meals that it\u2019s unnecessary to do so before bed. Besides, I like being nice and hungry for breakfast in the morning; breakfast is the best.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishDinnerShoppingRead MorecultureWhy I'm Eating 90 Grams of Protein a DayBy Adriana VelezRecipes you want to make.
