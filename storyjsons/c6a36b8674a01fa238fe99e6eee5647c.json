But when you have 20 more minutes to spare, cook down piles of greens with well-browned onions, LOTS of garlic, and a handful of Parm to render them into something special. Don\u2019t even think about skimping on the garlic; using a halved head adds a lot to the dish, but because the cloves mostly stay contained, it won\u2019t be overwhelming.

I too, like other reviewers, found the top of the garlic cloves messy and they did not stay together in the pan, so I lifted the peels off of those pieces and just cooked them with the onions after they had softened in the oil. I used 1/2 bacon drippings for the cooking oil and added 2 tablespoons of balsamic dressing when I added the kale to give more liquid to the whole thing. Super good. Laura PNC1/31/2022I love this recipe so much. I have used it to braise kale, chard and even purple cabbage as well as green cabbage. I agree with some of the other commenters that the garlic head gets messy and I have found it easier to  just throw in some peeled garlic cloves with the onion (I've also added shallots). I also use broth in place of water for a little extra flavor kick.SnicklefritzLouisville, CO12/2/2021I went over the recipe and was confused with the garlic bulbs. So, before I started cooking, I cut the garlic bulb in half and put them in \u201cfoil cups\u201d, cut side up. Drizzle with EVOO and a bit smoked paprika. I baked it for 45 minutes at 450*. Let cool enough to handle them squeeze into a bowl. Remove any skin than may fall in. Then put in instead of bulbs. It\u2019ll add a bit of smokiness to the dish. My 9 yr old loved this meal! \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffdSSG Jessica Texas10/16/2021I found this recipe to be a great idea but poorly written, unfortunately.  The main problem was that the top half of my garlic bulb didn\u2019t hold together so at the end of the cooking time I ended up having to squeeze each individual garlic clove out to remove the peels.  I tend to reduce the oil in my cooking but I still couldn\u2019t see any reason for 1/3 cup of oil in this recipe; I reduced it to 2 tablespoons.  I did enjoy the final product.AnonymousPacific Grove, CA10/7/2021I liked this recipe a lot, but it took way longer than 15 minutes to cook down the liquid into a flavorful broth. The parmesan didn't do a lot to thicken the broth, either. Ended up simmering for about an hour and a half, and the kale was overcooked for my taste but still tasty. I would use collards next time since they take to braising much better. As others said, squeeze the garlic out of the skins and mash them into the greens\u2014key to the recipe! Also recommend adding a splash of wine before the water for some acid, or squeezing lemon at the end.lasagnaqueenPortland, Oregon9/15/2021As some of the other reviewers noted, it isn\u2019t clear what to do with the garlic\u2026 before adding the parm, I pulled out the two garlic halves, then popped about half of the cloves back in and gave em a little smooshing. Other than the confusion about the garlic, I\u2019d give this recipe an 11/10. It was so tasty, so easy, and I can\u2019t begin to describe what a relief it is that this recipe has such a short ingredients list! Thanks, Chris :)LeighBaltimore, MD9/9/2021Maybe a silly question but what do I do with the garlic?  Leave it in peel and all?  Do I squeeze it out like roasted garlic or just take the two halves out??SteveOregon 9/2/2021I want to love this recipe and Im sure I would have if I had not followed the directions to salt every time you put a handful in (or mayve I read that wrong). It is so salty I almost can't eat it and there goes my kale. rebeccaNYC9/1/2021Loved this recipe. Really a great way to use up hardy greens from my vegetable garden and the CSA. The garlic is key! I served the dish with vegan sausage to make it into a complete dinner.Erin RiesTelluride, CO8/26/2021Fantastic departure from my usual fast collard greens--saut\u00e9ed in red peppers and onions, with cajun seasoning and dash of vinegar--subbed parmesan for nutritional yeast and water for chicken broth, will definitely be part of my weekly rotation! JD LaurenSan Diego, CA8/24/2021Omg these were SO good. My husband and I ate them all in one sitting. We\u2019ll definitely make it again.Anonymous8/15/2021Explore Bon App\u00e9titGarlicVegetableParmesanCheeseKaleLeafy GreensCollard GreensEasySideGluten-FreeNut-FreeVegetarianKetoBraiseDinnerRecipes you want to make.
