Using a Microplane, finely grate lemongrass, chile (seeds and all!), garlic, and ginger into a medium bowl.

Turn as needed to coat completely. Let sit at least 10 minutes and up to 2 hours.

Transfer to a cutting board and let rest 10 minutes before slicing.Step 4Transfer ribs to a platter and top with scallions and cilantro and sprinkle with sesame seeds.

It's super simple - just roughly chop the marinade ingredients and throw them in a food processor or blender and let that do the work. I use boneless beef short ribs and let them marinate 12-24 hours (the beef can handle the relatively gentle marinade so it's a great \"make-ahead\" meal). The flavor is amazing and perfect for warm nights and grilling. I make this at least once a month in the spring and summer. BmoreBrianBaltimore6/11/2021This was a fabulous recipe.  I did brine the meat for about an hour before marinating.  The result was a wonderful beefy \"steak\" with a lovely crust.  I am making it again for Labor Day.caster4california8/31/2019Explore Bon App\u00e9titShort RibBeefMeatLemongrassHerbs & SpicesSummerQuickEasyWeeknight MealsMainDairy-FreeGrillingPassoverFourth Of JulyMemorial DayLabor DayDinnerRecipes you want to make.
