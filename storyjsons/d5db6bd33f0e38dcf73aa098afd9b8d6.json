But it was the free chips she passed out (cut and baked from the previous day\u2019s pita bread) that kept her customers lining up. Within months, the food cart was in the garage and Stacy\u2019s Pita Chips was a budding wholesale business, eventually hitting the shelves of Trader Joe\u2019s and other national grocery chains. Since selling Stacy\u2019s to PepsiCo in 2006, Madison has started two more food ventures, including, most recently, a line of energy bars, BeBold, and is the spokesperson for Stacy\u2019s Rise Project, an organization that supports aspiring women food entrepreneurs\u2014like Sophia Maroon of Dress It Up salad dressings.\u00a0Amanda Shapiro: How did you finance Stacy\u2019s Pita Chips at the beginning? How did that change as the company grew?Stacy Madison: We self-funded all the way through. We didn\u2019t want to give up equity to investors, and luckily we never had to. We did the credit card shuffle, taking advantage of introductory rates and keeping track of our debt. We also had $100K in student loans to manage. As we grew, we took out bank loans and lines of credit to do things like buy a building and a bread production line. You\u2019re chasing money at first, but once you start generating, the banks come to you.What\u2019s one thing you did differently from your competitors that paid off?We knew we couldn\u2019t compete with a $3 family-size bag of tortilla chips, so we got Stacy\u2019s Pita Chips placed in the deli section instead of the chip aisle. We wanted to be seen and sampled, so we worked with deli managers to set up demos. We drew more customers to the delis, and we put a higher value on our product.Tell me about the decision to sell Stacy\u2019s Pita Chips. Was it a tough call?We had no intention of selling. We were making money doing what we loved to do every day. But as it grew, the company started to run us rather than us running the company. I had kids. My business partner Mark wanted to travel. Meanwhile, these global companies were knocking on our door. I really went through a grieving process: excitement, fear, anger, loneliness, frustration, sadness, loss, and, eventually, gratitude and starting over.Having started two more companies now, what\u2019s one thing that\u2019s gotten easier and one thing that\u2019s harder?I know how to assemble a trustworthy team, and I understand the ups and downs of being a business owner. I\u2019ve become a professional at crisis intervention. The harder part is [managing] the unrealistic expectations. After Stacy\u2019s, I feel like I have to create another successful company overnight. I feel that pressure from retailers, wholesalers, distributors, even myself.What\u2019s one thing that fledgling entrepreneurs don\u2019t think about enough?Cash. Everything takes twice as long and is twice as expensive as you anticipated. Know what you have in the bank, and make sure it\u2019s enough.What\u2019s one rule you live by?No meetings after 4 p.m. But we do break that rule sometimes.Recipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works. Restaurant recommendations you trust.FacebookTwitterPinterestInstagramYouTubeMore from Bon App\u00e9titMastheadNewsletter SignupBon App\u00e9tit Media KitContactSubscription FAQsCareersRSS FeedsSite MapAccessibility HelpCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCond\u00e9 Nast SpotlightDo Not Sell My Personal Info\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
