In this twist on a classic fonduta, Secchi emulsifies the sauce using the salted water from blanching asparagus instead of cream or butter. The heat from the water gently cooks the egg yolks and melts the Parmesan, forming a rich, velvety blanket to coat your vegetables.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Using tongs, immediately transfer asparagus to a large bowl of ice water; let sit 30 seconds. Transfer to a kitchen towel and pat dry; arrange on a platter. Measure 3 Tbsp. cooking liquid from pot and set aside in a small bowl.Step 2Blend egg yolks, Parmesan, and oil in a blender on low speed, scraping down sides as needed, until well combined. Increase speed to high and, with motor running, gradually drizzle in reserved hot cooking liquid; blend until smooth and emulsified. Immediately pour fonduta over asparagus.How would you rate Asparagus With Parmesan Fonduta?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (1)Back to TopTriangleLoved this sauce over asparagus. I don\u2019t think my cooking water was hot enough when added to the yolk-oil-parm mixture, so the Parmesan didn\u2019t fully melt. The flavor was still divine. I\u2019d take this over a hollandaise any day! Both from ease of preparation and flavor. \n\n We served it the asparagus with the porcini gnocchi, also from this issue, and the Parmesan fonduta that seeped over and mixed with the brown butter sage sauce was rich heaven.
