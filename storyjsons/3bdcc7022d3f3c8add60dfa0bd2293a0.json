After battling peritoneal cancer, Yanes died on June 16. We asked food stylists and editors who worked with him to share their memories, lightly edited for clarity.At Gourmet, we food editors wanted Romulo involved in all aspects of a recipe because he had such great ideas about making it visually appealing. He liked to tell the story of a recipe: sometimes that meant showing the beauty of the ingredients in a process shot, other times that meant cut-up fruit with juices leaking onto a cutting board, placed next to a hot-from-the-oven pie. And in the end, that\u2019s what food magazines were and still are about: enticing viewers with photographs so delicious-looking they\u2019ll want to run into the kitchen to start cooking.But Romulo\u2019s thoughts on food weren\u2019t confined to the visuals: With his keen palate and enthusiastic enjoyment of good food, he was sought after in daily tastings, and his opinions on dishes carried as much weight as those of my food editor colleagues.\u00a0\nPhoto courtesy Yanes familySome of Romulo\u2019s best pictures happened after he\u2019d satisfied the art department with some shots. Then he\u2019d say to the food stylist, \u201cLet\u2019s play,\u201d or, \u201cLet\u2019s try it another way.\u201d It might be as simple as turning the plate 180 degrees, or trying a different prop, or \u201cmessing up\u201d the food on the plate to make it look as natural as possible. The shot that Romulo was really proud of was a slice of chocolate truffle tart with a forkful taken out and the fork on the plate. There are fork marks and a smear on the plate that show just how delightfully creamy the texture of the cake is.Dark chocolate wedding cake with orange buttercream frosting for Gourmet magazine\u2019s September 1996 cover\nPhoto by Romulo YanesLocation shoots were also great fodder for stories. In the late \u201990s, we shot a wedding menu in Bucks County, Pennsylvania. My two young daughters were enlisted to model as flower girls. They looked at the wedding cake from afar, afraid to get too close. In order to get a good shot, Romulo urged them closer. \u201cDoesn\u2019t that frosting look good? Don\u2019t you want to taste it? Go on, try a taste. It\u2019s okay, really, it\u2019s okay.\u201d And with that permission, my younger daughter swiped her finger through the frosting and into her mouth. Click! Romulo nailed the shot that went on the cover.In some ways, it\u2019s fair to say that Romulo was the glue that kept the test kitchen together. He had a wicked sense of humor and kept all of us in the kitchen laughing throughout the day. When Gourmet closed, those of us from the food department missed the jokes and the camaraderie most. \u2014Kemp Minifie, former executive food editor, \u2018Gourmet\u2019December 2011 cover of Bon App\u00e9tit\nPhoto by Romulo Yanes, Food styling by Karen Evans, Prop styling by Kim FicaroWhen I first arrived at Bon App\u00e9tit at 4 Times Square with an all-new staff, I commissioned Romulo to start doing the front of the book as a trial. I was intimidated by him at first. But within an hour of meeting him, I adored him. Not only was he charming and kind, but a brilliant food photographer who taught all of us so much. He sailed through the most difficult shots with grace and ease, always delivering perfect advice in the most humble way. We spent a lot of time together over the years on set, and one delirious evening when we had all been at it too long, we came up with \u201ccheese nicknames\u201d that best suited our personalities. We all knew that Romulo was most definitely \u201cManchego\u201d\u2014aged and slightly buttery yet zesty. \u2014Alexandra Pollack, former photo director, \u2018Bon App\u00e9tit\u2019March 2012 cover of Bon App\u00e9tit\nPhoto by Romulo Yanes, Food styling by Rebecca Jurkevich, Prop styling by Lucy Attwater.January 2013 cover of Bon App\u00e9tit\nPhoto by Romulo Yanes, Food styling by Rebecca Jurkevich, Prop styling by Pamela Duncan SilverI met him while I was cross-testing and assisting at Gourmet, and he was quick to take me under his wing after we bonded over our shared Cuban heritage. While I can\u2019t recall a specific moment on set, I do have a favorite cover. Or two. One is a pizza pie, and the other is a gorgeous pork chop sizzling in a cast-iron with butter, garlic, and herbs. My memory says we shot all night and went through hundreds of pizzas and pork chops to get those two shots. Obviously not the case, but maybe close.Rom was gentle, kind, quick-witted, and sharp-tongued. He was always making jokes and sharing beautiful images. We lost a very good soul. \u2014Rebecca Jurkevich, food stylistCheese photograph for Bon App\u00e9tit March 2012 issue\nPhoto by Romulo Yanes, food styling by Alison Attenborough, prop styling by Beverley HydeWe always had fun working, and he would joke around calling me Lady A. He would drive me crazy with styling Christmas candies and tweaking them so I would leave him to it and let his inner food stylist come out! But we had great fun with cheeses and rigging them together\u2014I think we worked on a beautiful cheese story for Bon App\u00e9tit. And one on Parmesan broth too.He worked at Cond\u00e9 Nast for 20 years, and his work was his life. He wanted to work until the end. I think, especially during COVID-19, working was a way for all of us to feel more normal. He took some beautiful images and was always passionate about his work. And he was an inspiration to many young photographers. \u2014Alison Attenborough, food stylistFebruary 2006 cover of Gourmet magazine\nPhoto by Romulo Yanes, Food styling by Maggie Ruggiero, Prop styling by Julia Garcia-Tobar.Romulo was a great collaborator. He thought about every element in a photograph, and all along he would have us rolling in the aisles with his very wicked humor. His trademark was using a roll of Bounty paper towels for bouncing light; actually, he had several tricks up his sleeve using Bounty. Bounty was his muse. \u2014Maggie Ruggiero, food stylistIce cream photograph for Gourmet magazine\u2019s August 2009 issue\u00a0\nPhoto by Romulo Yanes, food styling by Maggie Ruggiero, prop styling by Haley ThurshwellHe was generous and helpful with me, even though we did not work together that often. But it felt like we had always known each other in our work life. \u2014Susie Theodorou, food stylistHe was wonderful, kind, and well-loved. A strong and talented pillar at Gourmet for so many years. I consider myself so lucky to have known and worked with him. It is heartbreaking that someone so lovely had to be taken away so soon. \u2014Erika Oliveira, art director, \u2018Gourmet\u2019Explore Bon App\u00e9titCultureRecipes you want to make.
