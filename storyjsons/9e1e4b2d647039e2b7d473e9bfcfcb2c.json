It was a long time coming: He\u2019d been chain-smoking since the age of 14, and at his worst, he demolished three packs a day. The surgery left a stitched scar in the middle of his chest, patched together like the lips on a Raggedy Ann doll. The aftermath demanded a complete overhaul of his lifestyle, and, by extension, the rest of the family\u2019s. We bought him a stool to sit on when he bathed himself. For exercise, he would pace an indoor mall, making three or four laps.It also required a dietary facelift, so he and my mother visited a nutritionist, who gave them clear instructions: Eat out less. Cook at home more. Buy a \u201cheart-healthy\u201d cookbook. My parents found Indian Recipes for a Healthy Heart on Amazon the next day. It arrived promptly, a stiff, pale-pink paperback. The author identified herself as \u201cMrs. Lakhani,\u201d conjuring the image of a schoolmistress. On the back cover, there was a photo of a stately woman with fair skin and a sharp nose wearing a sari the color of watermelon flesh.This mysterious Mrs. Lakhani gave my mother lessons she found invaluable: She stopped using chicken legs, instead only breasts, and removed all the visible fat from the chicken. She cut out red meat. She used oil sparingly. This was terrible news for my father, who bragged about how he once ate 20 luchi, flatbreads my mother deep-fried punishingly in oil until they inflated into pimply little saucers, in a single sitting.An image of Mrs. Lakhani from the Nanaimo Daily News in 1991.\nPhoto courtesy of Nanaimo Daily NewsReleased in March 1992 by the now-defunct Fahil Publishing Company, Indian Recipes for a Healthy Heart belongs to that category of cookbooks written for patients in cardiac recovery and the people who don\u2019t want to become them. As food historian Marion Nestle explained, this genre is thought to have begun with Ancel & Margaret Keys\u2019s book, Eat Well and Stay Well in 1959, followed by The American Heart Association Cookbook in 1973. Today, it has swelled to the point of over-saturation; the phrase \u201cheart healthy cookbook\u201d yields nearly 200 results on Amazon alone.Lakhani\u2019s was the only cardiac recovery cookbook my parents could find that focused on Indian cooking. In its opening pages, three cardiologists extol the virtues of Lakhani\u2019s diligence in the face of her spouse\u2019s heart disease. The longest of these forewords, from cardiologist Vidya S. Kaushik, comes with hearty dose of alarmism. \u201cEnjoy the delectable dishes in this book and beat the odds of being another statistical blip on the cardiac epidemiologist\u2019s graph,\u201d he writes. Eat so you don\u2019t become a number.Lakhani outlines the book\u2019s origin story in the introduction: A few years after they wed, Lakhani and her husband became aware of his high blood cholesterol. Their doctor gave him \u201ca handful of low-cholesterol, low-fat English recipes,\u201d which they found bland and sterile. They fell back on old habits with marginally more healthful substitutions\u2014Indian food cooked in vegetable oil or margarine instead of butter\u2014and excised red meats, whole milk, eggs, and cream. But these measures didn\u2019t safeguard her husband from bypass surgery years later. Lakhani realized that eating well required a more significant dietary shift. Determined to make a change, she looked for heart-healthy Indian recipes but couldn\u2019t find any.So she wrote her own, modifying a book she\u2019d been writing based on her \u201cfavorite classical recipes\u201d from India, and wedding it to her newfound holistic philosophy about heart health. \u201c[A] good diet, although a very important factor, is not sufficient for achievement of good health\u2014other lifestyle factors such as exercise and stress management are equally, if not more, important,\u201d she writes. She spends seven pages mapping \u201cthree pillars\u201d for overall fitness: exercise, diet, and stress management.1992 LA Times coverage of Fatima Lakhani\nPhoto courtesy of the LA TimesA March 1992 story in the Los Angeles Times gives slightly more color to the story Lakhani sketches. Mrs. Lakhani\u2019s first name, I learned, is Fatima. She and her husband, Aziz, were \u201cIndians from Africa\u201d (an author biography names Kenya for Fatima) who lived in England before moving to the town of Ranchos Palos Verdes in southern California. \u201cI\u2019m a completely changed person,\u201d Aziz told the paper of the family\u2019s new diet. \u201cI feel absolutely normal\u2014as a matter of fact, better than before.\u201d Fatima made it clear that she was writing against the idea that Indian food is so oil-rich that feeding it to someone is tantamount to gastrointestinal assault. \u201cIndian food is potentially the healthiest food ever,\u201d she told the paper.The book\u2019s back cover refers to Fatima as an \u201caccomplished culinary artist\u201d who taught Indian cooking classes in Los Angeles. A Los Angeles Times ad from October 1985 states that, for 90 dollars, you could get a four-session \u201cIndian hors d\u2019oeuvres class\u201d in what appears to be her home in Rancho Palos Verdes. \u201cA TASTE of INDIA\u2014Dinner with Fatima Lakhani,\u201d reads a December 1985 ad; for a three-hour $20 session, she would give you \u201can opportunity to explore festive dishes from India,\u201d which entailed making lamb biryani, kebabs, and an avocado pear dessert.My family\u2019s dependence on this book didn\u2019t last forever. My mother cooked through the book with consistently diminishing returns. As time passed, she grew dismayed by the use of margarine in an era when health-conscious America was becoming hip to the perceived sin of hydrogenated fats, coupled with growing societal suspicion surrounding the causal link between high cholesterol and heart disease, distilled in 2007\u2019s Good Calories, Bad Calories by Gary Taubes. She tried making some samosas in her oven, and they emerged hard as stone.In the book, these samosas are called \u201cexotic vegetable triangles,\u201d and chicken biryani is \u201cfestive chicken and rice,\u201d as if promising a gastronomic safari. It\u2019s the kind of terminology that seems straight out of a Colonial-era playbook. Such language, I initially rationalized, was a condition of Fatima Lakhani\u2019s era and the cultural currents she swam against. Then I remembered that Julie Sahni refers to aloo samosas in 1980\u2019s Classic Indian Cooking as \u201csavory pastries with potato filling,\u201d with no vocabulary of exoticism. Lakhani\u2019s language doesn\u2019t quite square with the quotes of a woman who speaks of the tired misconceptions that get stuck to Indian food. In an article in the Los Angeles Times in January 1991, she expresses dismay at how Indian cooking has become \u201csynonymous with curry,\u201d a misconception many still bemoan today.Who was Fatima Lakhani writing for? I would\u2019ve asked her had I been able to reach her. My calls to numbers listed along with public records under her and her son\u2019s name went unanswered. I couldn\u2019t reach her daughter either, nor did any of the cardiologists who wrote forewords to the book respond to my multiple requests for comment. I\u2019ve gathered, from the lack of any public death records, that she\u2019s likely alive, though her husband appears to have passed. Azizuddin Lakhani died in January 1998, aged 62, and he is buried in Hollywood Hills. There is no listed cause of death.In the absence of clarity, I found myself fighting a temptation to graft my own family\u2019s experiences onto Lakhani\u2019s. My father\u2019s heart didn\u2019t recover for long, battered by the eventual installation of a pacemaker, then by heart blockages and lung cancer. He died last June. The experience of losing him has been so alienating that there\u2019s a perverse comfort in believing that a stranger who filled a crucial gap for my family for years may have had a coda as senseless as ours.If I had the chance, I would ask Lakhani if she and her children experienced my family\u2019s same disenchantment with a regimented, seemingly health-conscious lifestyle. I wonder if Lakhani felt she did enough, how much weight and importance she put on the food they ate every day at home. I wonder if she would\u2019ve written the book differently. Maybe she would\u2019ve gone easy on the margarine. Maybe she wouldn\u2019t change a word.In the year since my father\u2019s death, my mother and I have tried to triangulate where he went wrong, or whether he just got dealt a shit hand in life. We knew other people who\u2019ve smoked for years, we\u2019ve said, and they\u2019re still alive and kicking. Following the instructions in a cookbook can\u2019t shield someone from a body that\u2019s conspiring to destroy them. But I wondered if the book\u2019s recipes carried Lakhani\u2019s family through its roughest patches in the same way it did for us, as a form of palliative care.After my father\u2019s death, my mother realized she couldn\u2019t stay in the apartment where she\u2019d last lived with him, so she decided to move, which required downsizing. \u201cWas he a hoarder?\u201d she asked me one Saturday in April, piling books into a cart we wheeled to a book drop near her apartment. I hadn\u2019t realized that Indian Recipes for a Healthy Heart was in that pile. Once she\u2019d settled into her new apartment, I scanned her bookshelf looking for it. I asked her why she threw the book out, telling her I wanted to write about it. She was only keeping the essentials, my mother reasoned, and though she no longer needed it, someone else might.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishIndianCookbooksessayRead MorecultureThis Cookbook Helped Me Rediscover My Family's FoodBy Alejandra BorundaRecipes you want to make.
