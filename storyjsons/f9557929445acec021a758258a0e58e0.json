I don't have a grill so I sliced, salted (and let sit for about 10 mins), and drizzled my eggplant with olive oil and roasted in the oven for about 50 mins on 450. They came out great this way! The sauce was really good -- could've used a bit more lemon, which I might mix into the sauce directly in the future. EmilyDavis, CA9/23/2021Would help if you noted to pierce the eggplant before grilling.  Mine exploded in the grill and went flying everywhere.AnonymousColumbus OH6/13/2020Explore Bon App\u00e9titMiddle EasternEggplantVegetableTahiniCondiments, Sauces & PastesGarlicSummerEasySideVegetarianGluten-FreeHealthyishGrillingDinnerRecipes you want to make.
