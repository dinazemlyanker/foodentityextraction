That\u2019s part of the charm of Bria Vinaite, the Lithuania-born, Brooklyn-raised 25-year-old who burst onto the Hollywood scene (and into our hearts!) with her portrayal of a single mother raising her daughter Moonee in a Disney World-adjacent motel in the 2017 Oscar-nominated film The Florida Project.Since then, the vegetarian animal lover\u2014expect to see the occasional home-cooked veggie dish on her Insta feed, along with carefree dancing videos, and relatable depression/anxiety/self-love memes\u2014has been doing what many women her age yearn to do: exploring different fields that feed her creative spirit and making a living while doing so.Despite the whirlwind of excitement following Vinaite\u2019s big debut, prioritizing solo time to recalibrate and pursue various other passions remains key. \u201cNo one\u2019s going to take care of you but yourself, and when you start making that a top priority, your life changes,\u201d she says like the friend who somehow always delivers that glass-half-full wisdom without sounding corny. \u201cIt\u2019s making sure that you\u2019re 100 percent or working on being the best you that you can be. When you\u2019re feeling good, you can be a light to others and spread that happiness.\u201d Here, Vinaite shares her favorite bedtime weed treats, how disconnecting from technology has made for a more peaceful night of rest, and the \u201cwholesome\u201d LaCroix drink she sips before bed.Bria's bedroom walls\nPhoto by Emma FishmanUnplugging with a bookI buy a lot of random books, and it\u2019s really hard to immediately fall asleep if I\u2019ve been staring at a screen, so reading and trying to put my phone away maybe an hour before I go to sleep are two of my go-to strategies before bed. I have a bunch of Paulo Coelho books, and I recently bought his book Warrior of the Light: Short Notes on Accepting Failure, Embracing Life, and Rising to Your Destiny, thinking it was going to be a book book, like a story, but it ended up being page-long short passages. I flipped to a random page and it was so accurate with the things I\u2019ve been going through. They\u2019re little life lessons I try to sleep on at the end of my day. It\u2019s been really nice to have those be my last thoughts before I fall asleep.Joints at home; vape pens on the goI love to smoke a joint before I go to sleep: That\u2019s my number one thing. I have two favorite products. If I\u2019m in L.A., I always get the Dosist pens for sleep. They\u2019re so perfectly dosed and if I take two pulls of that, I go right to sleep. It\u2019s the most ideal option when I\u2019m traveling. If I\u2019m at home, I have special pre-rolls of indica joints that are for bedtime. That\u2019s really relaxing. And lately I\u2019ve been trying CBD pills from this great brand, Remedi. Literally every night that I took one I went to sleep within half an hour. So that\u2019s something I\u2019m definitely incorporating on nights where I feel like I\u2019m not able to fall asleep because I\u2019m anxious about the next day.A warm shower and a good body scrubA warm shower before bed to feel relaxed is always nice. I\u2019m really into scrubs and use a green tea and lemon nourishing body scrub by Tocca. It wakes you up and has such a lovely, refreshing scent. It sounds like it would be weird or gross but I like it, and I\u2019m a weirdo who\u2019s so picky, so I feel like a lot of people would.Bria's seriously stocked skincare lineup.\nPhoto by Emma FishmanLaCroix and cotton candy grapesI am obsessed with LaCroix, and I drink so much of it. I\u2019ll definitely have one before I go to sleep. Usually, I go for the grapefruit flavor but lately I\u2019ve been drinking the unflavored one just because it\u2019s called \u201cpure\u201d and I feel like that\u2019s so wholesome. I\u2019ve also been eating a lot of blueberries, and I\u2019m really obsessed with cotton candy grapes. They have them at Whole Foods. They\u2019re organic, and it\u2019s the weirdest thing: they taste like blue cotton candy.Removing makeup before bed aka ~ growth ~I\u2019ve struggled with skin issues my whole life. The one thing that changed 100 percent for me, from being younger to now, is I will not go to sleep until I\u2019ve fully taken off my makeup and washed my face and put on every moisturizer. I really love Neutrogena\u2019s acne mask. It\u2019s cleared up my skin on a bunch of occasions. I just started using it again because my skin is acting crazy because of the weather. And I really love masks like GlamGlow and the mint mask from Lush. I just like minty and cooling things. Brooklyn, who plays my daughter in The Florida Project, her mom taught me a little mint hack. Back when I used to get bad migraines, she sent me peppermint oil and told me to put it on my temples, and it\u2019s definitely helped me a lot.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishGoing to Bed withInterviewsRead MorecultureAlok Vaid-Menon Winds Down with Vegan Junk Food and a \"Massage Drill\"By Martine ThompsonRecipes you want to make.
