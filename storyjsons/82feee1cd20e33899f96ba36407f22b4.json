Chef Martin Picard put Quebecois food on the map, and his nephew now runs the kitchen, but the near-religious devotion to gluttony still remains.ORDER THE: tender duck magret, bechamel-covered tomato tart, lobster poutine (because if you must have poutine, this is the place), and the iconic Plogue \u00e0 Champlain, a buckwheat pancake layered with melted cheese, roasted potatoes, bacon, and a quivering slab of seared foie gras finished off with a drizzle of maple syrup. For foie gras lovers, this is the top of the mountain: There\u2019s a whole section devoted to it on the menu, and some of the perfectly cooked lobes are so large they can be carved like a roast.THE VIBE IS: fun and lively, but with many diners focused on the serious food and wine, the decibel level stays reasonable. The staff is hospitable, knowledgeable, and proud to show off their native cuisine\u2014keep an eye out for adept waiters nimbly preparing dishes tableside.PRACTICAL STUFF: Open Wednesday to Sunday 5 p.m. to midnight. Closed Mondays and Tuesdays. Reservations recommended: For small parties of three or fewer, try to snag seats at the bar for a view into the kitchen. For larger parties, you\u2019re better off taking the table in the back adjacent to the wine cellar with drying hams hanging among the bottles.\u2014Claire SaffitzPhoto by Dominique LafondPhoto by Dominique LafondPhoto by Dominique LafondWE ALSO LOVEL\u2019ExpressWhen you want the French bistro classics, you go to this Plateau institutionPatisserie Au Kouign-AmannA carby, sugary haven in the PlateauSchwartz\u2019sA must-visit sandwich institution still slinging smoked meat in the PlateauExplore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
