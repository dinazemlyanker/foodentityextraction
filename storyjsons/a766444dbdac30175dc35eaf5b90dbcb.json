The key is to cook the okra for a long time, with a lot of whole spices. It\u2019s a foolproof and quick way to get the most flavor out of the summer vegetable while avoiding any slimy texture. You end up with charred, fragrant morsels that are perfect as a side or as a main dish eaten with rice or roti. The key seasoning here is ajwain, which tastes like a more piquant oregano and is a classic pairing for okra\u2019s mild, slightly grassy tones. If you don\u2019t have access to fresh okra, particularly later in the year, try precut frozen okra\u2014it often tastes just as great as the fresh stuff.

Add ajwain seeds and cook, stirring, until golden brown, about 1 minute. Add turmeric and asafetida and swirl skillet to combine, then add chile. Increase heat to high; add okra, coriander, and fennel seeds and toss gently with a metal or other heatproof spatula (you don\u2019t want to smash the okra). Reduce heat to medium and spread out okra in an even layer. Cook, tossing halfway through, until starting to brown, about 10 minutes total. (Tossing instead of stirring is the best way to keep the okra intact and from getting gummy.) Season with salt and continue to cook, turning occasionally, until lightly charred, about 5 minutes longer. (Okra may look gummy at first, but eventually it will start to char).Step 2Remove okra from heat; gently mix in amchoor and add lime juice to taste. Season with more salt if needed.How would you rate Bhindi Ki Sabzi?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (11)Back to TopTriangleI am not a bhindi person at all, but this recipe has made me a believer!

At the beginning I added some mustard and nigella seeds after the cumin, and a bunch of ground spices (I remember putting in fenugreek and turmeric but can't remember what else) and added in mushrooms with the okra. I seasoned with chaat masala and used ghee. I had this as tacos with scrambled egg and !!! dude ! so goodHannahUK1/4/2021This is so great and really easy!
