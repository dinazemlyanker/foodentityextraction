And pasta salad. And chicken wings. Oprah is invited. Welcome.By Alex DelanyMay 25, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Alex Lau, food styling by Rebecca Jurkevich, prop styling by Amy WilsonFacebookTwitterEmailWhoa. Was that Michael Jordan who just walked by? Holding a glazed chicken wing and drinking lemonade from a tiki glass that looks like a basketball hoop? Is that Diane Keaton, in an oversized Hawaiian shirt and comically large sunglasses, lounging in a chair by the pool? Is Oprah talking to your 10th grade math teacher about the charred cabbage? Yup. This is all happening. Because we\u2019re at Delany\u2019s 100% Hypothetical Fantasy Cookout, where anything is possible. Dreams, reality, and astonishingly tasty food coexist without a hint of skepticism. It\u2019s great to see you. So glad you could make it. Feel free to grab a beer from the kegerator at the top of the water slide.Okay. The sad reality is that I can\u2019t actually throw a grilling party. The apartment building I live in doesn\u2019t allow grills or open flames on the premises. And even if I mustered up the courage to sneak one onto my balcony, Oprah hasn\u2019t returned my calls in weeks. Something tells me she wouldn\u2019t show. Which is sad, because throwing a party is my second favorite thing to do when it gets all sunny and warm outside. The first is grilling.But we just released a killer issue filled with some seriously rad grilling recipes, so I\u2019m not letting these real world road blocks get in my way. I\u2019m going to throw this party. Right here. With you. On the internet. Here\u2019s what\u2019s on the menu. Get ready to eat your butts off.Strawberry-Rose Agua FrescaPhoto by Alex Lau, food styling by Rebecca JurkevichI\u2019ll be serving a drink that can be consumed with or without booze, because there will be both kids (The Yodeling Walmart Boy from Youtube, D.W. from the animated television program Arthur, Andy from Toy Story, etc.) and adults at this cookout. A refreshing, fruity strawberry agua fresca will do the trick. You can head to any of the water fountains, which will start to dispense tequila after 6:00 p.m., to spike your beverage.Spiked Ginger-Mint LemonadePhoto by Peden + Munk, food styling by Sue Li, prop styling by Rebecca BartosheskyThere\u2019s a boozy lemonade stand over by the basketball courts. It\u2019s staffed by the Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew. If want them to serve you a dangerously sip-able cocktail that\u2019s as tart as it is minty, they\u2019ll do that. If you want them to solve mysteries for you, they\u2019ll also do that. That\u2019s hospitality.Grilled Corn Salad with Hot Honey-Lime DressingPhoto by Peden + Munk, food styling by Sue Li, prop styling by Rebecca BartosheskyAnd while we\u2019re at the basketball courts, it looks like Air Bud is here. Or maybe it\u2019s one of Air Bud\u2019s kids? Or grandkids? I don\u2019t know. Golden retrievers all look pretty much the same. Whoever it is seems to be ripping apart a bowl of the grilled corn salad with hot honey-lime dressing. It\u2019s brightly acidic thanks to the lime and a little spicy thanks to sriracha. But creamy chunks of avocado keep those flavors in check. Wait. Can dogs eat avocado? Should I be calling someone?Romesco Pasta Salad with Basil and ParmesanPhoto by Alex Lau, food styling by Rebecca Jurkevich, prop styling by Amy WilsonCan you hear me over the duet being sung by Patti Smith and Andre 3000? Great. Pass me the pasta salad. Yeah, you heard what I said. I\u2019m serving pasta salad, because even though it\u2019s one of the worst dishes ever invented, I managed to find one that\u2019s actually good. It\u2019s all of the classic Italian flavors you love, turned into a carb-y salad. Tomatoes, basil, peppers, Parmesan, and garlic, topped with crispy breadcrumbs and chopped walnuts. There\u2019s texture happening here, because this pasta salad is tossed in romesco sauce. It\u2019s not a giant pile of slimy salad dressing-soaked noodles.Charred Tomato SalsaPhoto by Alex LauWhere are the tortilla chips? Damnit. Maya Angelou has them on her float in the pool. We need them for this minimalist, charred tomato salsa. You can\u2019t have a cookout without chips and something to dip them in. This salsa is good enough to eat with a spoon though, with a hint of spiciness from a serrano and a gentle smack from lime juice.Charred Bean and Pea SaladPhoto by Alex Lau, food styling by Rebecca Jurkevich, prop styling by Amy WilsonEddie Murphy said these beans were amazing. I don\u2019t know. I haven\u2019t tried them yet, because my sous chef WALL-E (the robot from WALL-E) cooked them. But I do like Eddie Murphy, and he wouldn\u2019t shut up about them. They\u2019re acidic and salty and a little spicy. But most of all, this is a simple preparation for prime-season produce, a celebration of the vegetables at the market, and a perfect side for everyone at the cookout, including Eddie Murphy. Did I mention that Eddie Murphy showed up? Love Eddie Murphy.Savory Caramel Chicken WingsPhoto by Alex Lau, food styling by Rebecca Jurkevich, prop styling by Amy WilsonPaul Newman threw that horseshoe. He missed the pit by a little. Be cool. Pick it up and hand it back to him. He\u2019s a normal guy. You know what\u2019s not normal though? THE FREAKING SAVORY CARAMEL GLAZE ON THESE GRILLED CHICKEN WINGS. FISH SAUCE AND LEMONGRASS, ARE YOU KIDDING ME? A reincarnated Paul Newman playing horseshoes is an everyday sight compared to these things. Sweet and sticky and smoky, these wings are standing at the front of the queue to become cookout regulars all summer long. Clean your hands before touching the horseshoes though. No one likes a sticky horseshoe.Charred Cabbage with Goat Cheese Raita and CucumbersPhoto by Alex Lau, food styling by Rebecca Jurkevich, prop styling by Amy WilsonWho\u2019s a notable vegetarian? Madonna? No, she couldn\u2019t make it. Erykah Badu? Yes, Erykah is here. And she\u2019s vegetarian. So we need to have a standout vegetarian main. Cookouts aren\u2019t all meat, all the time, folks. That\u2019s why this charred cabbage with goat cheese raita and cucumbers is an absolute winner. The mix of textures (charred, crispy exterior and tender interior) here makes it seem like you\u2019re actually eating a piece of meat. And the acid and herbs in the salad combine with the creaminess of the yogurt to cover the rest of the bases. Speaking of, there are golf carts leaving from the side of the house to take you to the wiffle ball arena. Hurry up.Sticky-Sweet Grilled Pork ShoulderPhoto by Alex Lau, food styling by Rebecca Jurkevich, prop styling by Amy WilsonIf you think I\u2019m having a cookout without some red meat, you are mistaken. I floated the idea past Bill Murray when we were conceptualizing the menu, and he laughed in my face. Haven\u2019t seen him since. In hopes that he\u2019ll show up today, I\u2019ll be serving this sticky-sweet grilled pork shoulder, which was developed by a member of the royal barbecue family Aaron Franklin. The flavor on this piece of meat is absolutely bonkers, coated in a glaze that\u2019s equal parts sweet, spicy, and salty. It\u2019s beautiful, and it tastes a hell of a lot like char siu pork when all is said and done. Sliced thin with pickles, it is perfection. Enjoy. And let me know if you see Bill.Fried Fish Sandwiches with Cucumbers and Tartar SaucePhoto by Alex Lau, food styling by Chris MoroccoSIKE. It\u2019s a fish sandwich. This is a made-up party. I can do this if I want to. And I want to, because this is one of the best fried fish sandwiches I\u2019ve ever had. It\u2019s creamy and tangy, thanks to tartar sauce, and sliced cucumbers lighten the whole thing up to make you feel somewhat healthy. Plus, the fish itself was caught by Captain Quint from Jaws...before he got eaten by the giant shark.Strawberry Eton MessPhoto by Alex Lau, food styling by Rebecca JurkevichYou\u2019d think we\u2019d be having an elaborate, opulent dessert at this event, huh? Something that looks like the thing Rihanna chose to wear, which is cool, but a bit...much. We\u2019re not. We\u2019re going to keep it low-key with a Eton mess, a spoonable dessert made from fresh whipped cream, strawberries, and store-bought meringues.Eton mess is the dessert that brings this whole thing together, because at the end of the day, a cookout isn\u2019t about extravagance or impressing people. It isn\u2019t about notable celebrity guests, a 126-acre backyard, or a pool big enough to fit your jet skis. A cookout is about making delicious food for people who want to be outside. It\u2019s about relishing the simple joy of breathing fresh air, smelling the coals, and tearing into flavorful food with people you care about. Which is why I invited you. Hope you enjoyed yourself. Party favors are through the arcade. Get home safe.Want to keep you're grilling vibe a little healthier? Fine.
