That restaurant salad seems to pack so much flavor in every bite, regardless of how simple or complicated it may be. Nothing is (or should be) boring or bland. How do they do that? Well, that restaurant salad is better because it\u2019s dressed properly. And if we had to guess, we\u2019d also say that it\u2019s dressed twice.Yes, two times. Once with a baseline dressing and once with a dressing that lives in the spotlight. This is especially important when you're working with a thicker, richer dressing\u2014think a creamy homemade ranch, or a nutty tahini sauce\u2014that might be hard to distribute as evenly as, say, a vinaigrette.  These two dressings work together to make sure every bite of your salad is seasoned, and that no piece of lettuce, herb, or shaved vegetable stays dry and bland. Here\u2019s how it works.Think of salad dressing like a sauce because, well, that\u2019s exactly what it is. Sauce is a seasoning agent for your food, meant to coat everything it touches, and that means that salad dressing is a seasoning agent for your lettuce. Plain lettuce, without any dressing, isn\u2019t much to fantasize about. But when you add a little salt, fat, and acid to the situation, those leafy greens turn into something else entirely.And that\u2019s exactly what your baseline dressing should be: olive oil, acid (either citrus or vinegar), and salt. Using your hands, toss the greens of your salad with the simple dressing in a large bowl making sure every piece gets coated. Then transfer the seasoned greens to the platter or bowl you\u2019re going to serve it in. What you\u2019re looking at here is the fully seasoned foundation of a killer salad.After the base dressing comes the main dressing. And some crunchy stuff to boot.\nNow it\u2019s time for that marquee dressing. This might be a creamy homemade ranch. Or a miso and tahini situation. Or a classic Caesar. It doesn\u2019t really matter what it is. All that matters is that this dressing, which will almost always be thicker than the baseline dressing, gets drizzled over the salad.And here\u2019s where you can see what would happen if you didn\u2019t apply that baseline dressing. You\u2019re not going to paint every single leaf with this thicker dressing. There are going to be spots where the salad is left bare, missed by your artful drizzle. If the baseline dressing wasn\u2019t there, those bites wouldn\u2019t be seasoned. But since you\u2019ve tossed the lettuce in the simplest of sauces, they are. Every bite is guaranteed to taste like the best version of itself, whether it has a heap of that homemade ranch on it or not.Now you know. And now whenever you go into a restaurant, you can walk right into the kitchen, find the chef on the line assembling the salads, make eye contact, and give the \u201cI know exactly what\u2019s going on here,\u201d nod and wink in their direction. You\u2019re part of the club now.And here's a killer salad recipe, just in case:Every Night Salad with Yogurt RanchThis crunchy romaine number, drizzled with a creamy, craveable yogurt-based homemade ranch dressing, is the kind of salad that goes with just about anything, from delivery pizza to pan-seared pork chops.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titBasicallySaladSalad DressingRecipes you want to make.
