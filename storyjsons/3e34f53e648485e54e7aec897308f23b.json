Maybe it\u2019s the chef, or the concept, or the fact that you\u2019ll soon have [INSERT FAVORITE FOOD HERE] one block from your apartment. For me, in the case of San Francisco\u2019s new quick-service Afro-Caribbean grill Isla Vida, it was what the place stood for: a clearly stated attempt to push back against the relentless tidal wave of gentrification hitting the historically black Fillmore neighborhood. As rents go up and communities get displaced across the country, the intentions of chef/owner Jay Foster (who ran erstwhile Tenderloin soul food joint Farmerbrown for 13 years before it shut down for this very reason) felt bigger than just one neighborhood, and imperative to the preservation of good food in this country.Of course, falling in love with a place sight-unseen/food-untasted is a dangerous game, especially with lofty notions like the ones stated above. But I got lucky. Juicy chicken spun 50 abreast on a massive rotisserie, jerk-seasoned or Cuban-style; tender spare ribs doused in a smoky-sweet guava barbecue sauce; a thick meaty Cuban sammie with manchego served on crusty bread; housemade mango hot sauce with a finishing slap of habanero. As the jaunty, joke-cracking server piled dish after steaming dish onto my already crammed table, it became clear that Isla Vida was not just here to meet expectations, but to exceed them. From the crispy ribbon-shaped fries to the crackly blooms of churro sitting in a pool of chocolate, eating at Isla Vida was a just-about-perfect dining experience. The kind that feels good in your belly and your soul (and your wallet)\u2014even when your belly is full to the point of maybe-bursting and you have to cancel all your post-dinner plans and go to sleep. Although, to be perfectly honest, I was totally cool with that part too.Go There: Isla VidaExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendRestaurantsSan FranciscoRecipes you want to make.
