In \"There's No Better Time To...\" we'll share the little projects we're finally getting around to. Today: Find comfort in a batch of homemade yogurt.I have been making yogurt at home for years: bringing milk almost to a boil, dipping my finger into the pot to take its temperature, dolloping in a few tablespoons of yogurt reserved from the last batch, bundling it in a blanket and putting it to bed, then hitting the hay myself. The next morning I approach it on tiptoe, cracking the lid a little and then a lot, watching for the telltale wobble of a well-set pot. I gasp every time. Just because I know how the magic happens doesn\u2019t make it less magical. It is a particularly wonderful ritual in this strange, uncertain moment.Yogurt probably came to be as a way of making milk last longer, of extending its life. That\u2019s one reason yogurt-making is a powerful tool: You can deploy it when the gallons of milk you bought start to seem overzealous, but you can also make it with any amount of milk that you\u2019ve got. You can make it if the grocery store is low on yogurt, if you\u2019ve run out of breakfast options, or if you\u2019re feeling the urge to coddle or be coddled yourself. In other words, this is a very good time to make it.Making yogurt is something you do alone, but it\u2019s not a lonely endeavor. Like meditation, it simply demands your slowness and attention. Get distracted and the milk will boil over; add the starter too soon or too late and the bacteria won\u2019t have the ideal environment in which to multiply; rush it and you\u2019ll scorch the milk at the bottom of the pot. Yogurt demands your tenderness: At the moment you add the starter to the milk, the milk should be the same temperature as a baby\u2019s bath.And like sourdough, Amish friendship bread, and chain mail, yogurt is self-perpetuating: Add a little milk and a little heat and the few remaining tablespoons from your previous round and it will refashion itself ad infinitum, each new pot holding part of the soul of the first. If you strain the yogurt for a thicker version, it will give again, this time the tangy-cool liquid called whey that\u2019s as good for drinking plain as it is for cooking rice or potatoes. There is something very hopeful and comforting about this easy, endless giving, this open-handed generosity, this constant anticipation of a future batch.Caroline Lange is a recipe tester and developer, private chef, and food stylist living in Brooklyn.Explore Bon App\u00e9titThere's No Better Time CoronavirusBasicallyRecipes you want to make.
