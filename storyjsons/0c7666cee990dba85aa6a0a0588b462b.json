Here she tells whom she\u2019d invite to her dream dinner party and why.You get to host any three people, fictional or real, dead or alive. Who\u2019s invited?I\u2019ll stick to dead people. If I fail to invite some living people, they\u2019d be very annoyed. (Not to say other dead people wouldn\u2019t be. I\u2019d expect to hear from Samuel Johnson and Oscar Wilde, who prided themselves on their dinner conversation.) But here\u2019s my invite list: Graeme Gibson, my partner for many years; he loved a dinner party. He always cooked the main course and I did the starters, salad, and dessert. Charlotte Bront\u00eb and Toni Morrison would be my other guests. Both of them wrote novels with uncanny, weird stuff in them. Jane Eyre hears a spirit voice calling her over time and space and she answers it. I reviewed Beloved in the New York Times and have always been interested in Morrison\u2019s technically varied way of approaching subjects. So pairing her with Bront\u00eb, who gave us the first open-ended novel, would be fascinating, especially since one of them is from the 19th century and the other is from the 20th.What\u2019s on the menu?We\u2019d begin with a salad that involves oranges, avocados, and endive. Then Graeme would make this chicken dish that involves putting a lot of legs and thighs, a huge amount of garlic, an onion, a bouquet garni, and some cloves into a big Le Creuset. You make a dough out of flour, water, salt, and oil, roll it out like a sausage, and wrap it around the pot\u2019s rim. As it bakes, it forms a seal and the chicken steams in all that garlic.Do you bring it to the table in a dramatic fashion?The dough gets quite hard. It\u2019s a ceremonial moment when you crack it with a hammer. We\u2019d serve it with potatoes and green beans. For dessert I\u2019d make the fluffy baked lemon custard from The Joy of Cooking. I\u2019d set out white china with red trim (which belonged to Graeme\u2019s grandfather), candles, and either some florals or a crystal ball\u2014which, yes, I have in my possession.The conversation centers around one essay in your new book, Burning Questions\u2014which is it?These days it would probably be one of the environmental essays. Maybe the one on Rachel Carson and how prescient she is. When it comes to talking about the environment, I\u2019m interested in solutions. If you want some hope, go to drawdown.org, which has a lot of data and ideas about how to draw down greenhouse gases from the atmosphere.Who\u2019s the better dining companion, a scientist or a poet?I know quite a lot about poets, so for a learning experience, I\u2019d pick scientists\u2014but it depends what kind. Not physicists. They can\u2019t really explain to other people what they\u2019re doing. I could hang out with ornithologists. They\u2019re somewhat generalists because they have to know something about habitat, bird biology, migration patterns. And they need to go off the beaten track to find birds, so they\u2019re often quite adventurousExplore Bon App\u00e9titDream Dinner PartyPop CultureInterviewsRecipes you want to make.
