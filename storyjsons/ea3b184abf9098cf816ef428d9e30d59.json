Crunchy. Salty. Spicy. These veggie-packed fritters have it all! The spice level will definitely vary based on the brand of kimchi you use, so make sure to pick one you're familiar with if you're cooking for people who can't handle too much heat.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

I like them crisp and thin as well, so, to the New York 5/21 grumpy naysayer (\"Look elsewhere...\"), have you never made breakfast pancakes in your entire life? You see, there's a viscosity issue that even the smallest urchin at the stove can figure out on his or her own, namely, how to thicken or thin the batter. Let's see, more liquid: gonna test to see if that thickens the batter? Oy! It's not rocket science. THANK YOU BA for this fun recipe. For my dipping sauce, I add a small dollop of sesame oil--just my preference. Shared these with my neighbor--rave reviews (I took all the credit ;-})Gibby MacMasterPrinceton, NJ1/10/2022My family and I loved this for lunch with some roasted spicy bok choy.CecileCarpenteria, CA8/27/2021I initially thought that the batter was too thick after step 2, in step 3, I added the kimchi and the brine that came with it after chopping. After that, the batter became less thick.AnonymousPhilippines8/18/2021Question - Could this be served chilled - Thinking backyard BBQ....a platter of Kimchi Pancakes as a vegetarian dish. Thoughts?AnonymousSeattle, WA7/29/2021My first kimchi pancake! The batter is just perfect. I thought it will be thick as what the other comments said but I followed the ingredients first to see if it's really thick and it was just perfect. I like them crispy so I fry them thinly. Not so much with the dipping sauce as the pancake itself is already tasty. My family loves it. I will surely make this again. Thank you!AnonymousMississauga, ON, Canada7/4/2021The proportions in this recipe are just off. Had to add more water and the batter was still too thick. Annoyed that BA recipes are not tested properly before publication yet it\u2019s the first hit when googling kimchi pancake recipe. Look elsewhere\u2026AnonymousNew York, NY5/21/2021Love because it's simple and delicious!! Would suggest to make for a fun but quick (and not messy) lunch!AnonymousHouston, TX3/27/2021I love these! I've made them twice in the past month. The dipping sauce(well, not really a sauce) is great and I usually eat the pancakes with a fried egg. I think these would taste really good with yakisoba sauce. vanessaUtah3/11/2021Wtf is with the grape seed and olive oil in white-adapted asian cooking. If youre trying to be healthy use avocado oil, but if youre feeling authentic eating asian food, use vegetable or canola oil, always top it off with sesame oil. No asian food ever really requires grape seed oil... Anonymous2/28/2021They were  absolutely lovely! It was the first time making them and will definitely make again. Some reviewers here are saying that they found the batter a bit too thick? As it was my first time making them I don't really know what they're supposed to be like but I thought they were delicious just as they were!AnonymousLincoln, UK 2/16/2021perfect for a hangover, I made way to many for one person and saved then (you can drop them in a toaster the next day) EmSitumhamilton1/12/2021Fast, easy, comforting, crispy, full of hidden veg and ingredients I always have around. Perfect pandemic/depression food, now that I think of it! I make this at least every couple weeks - like them extra thin for crispies, up the spice and skip the sauce -- I prefer a runny egg and put the whole thing on some jasmine rice. It's so good dude, just make this recipe. LaurenMinneapolis, MN12/18/2020Flavor was good but the batter is way too thick with this recipe.  They should be much thinner than what this recipe makes.  I didn\u2019t even try other recipes based on the rating but pass on this.SamDC11/29/2020So good! Made this for breakfast and couldn\u2019t get enough it, I would definitely make this again. Anonymous8/1/2020Love this recipe. I used 1Tbs of vinegar and 1 Tbs of soy sauce for the dipping sauce and that was more than adequate. Had this for dinner with rice and this was a good amount for 2 people.rookieAustralia7/30/2020Explore Bon App\u00e9titPancakeKoreanEast AsianAsianQuickEasySideSnackDairy-FreeNut-FreeFryLunar New YearBasicallyRecipes you want to make.
