Pro tip: If you sign up for the newsletter, you'll get the scoop before everyone else.Let\u2019s get right to it.None of what I\u2019m about to say is a revelation; we didn\u2019t suddenly \u201cwake up\u201d to the realities of racism in this country after the death of George Floyd. But in light of his death and other unconscionable killings, I think it\u2019s necessary to be upfront about the ways institutional racism plays out, including at brands like Healthyish.While Healthyish has always sought to cover the diversity of the food and wellness worlds, we haven't always supported the Black community in a meaningful way. These are the ways that Healthyish and I, as its editor, have fallen short. So I want to talk about how Healthyish and I, as its editor, have fallen short. And how we\u2019ve tried to improve. And the work we still need to do.Healthyish has been guilty of optical allyship.First, what\u2019s optical allyship? As doula and writer Latham Thomas puts it, \u201cit makes a statement but doesn\u2019t go beneath the surface and is not aimed at breaking away from the systems of power that oppress.\u201dHere\u2019s what that means for us: We often say, \u201cWellness should be for everyone.\u201d You could even say it\u2019s our core mission. And the stories we run often focus on people of color, including those who are Black. But\u2014and here are the problems\u2014there are no full-time Black staffers at Healthyish. To be fair, there are no full-time staffers at Healthyish, period. Both assistant editor Aliza Abarbanel and I have responsibilities across Bon App\u00e9tit, and many other staffers contribute to Healthyish, but the vast majority of them are white too. Secondly we don\u2019t hire enough Black freelancers. The vast majority of our pitches come from white writers, and we haven\u2019t put in enough work to change that.As a result, I think our coverage, even when it\u2019s about non-white people and groups, ends up being written for white readers.And while we promote non-white people and businesses by posting about them on our platform, we need to also promote Black writers\u2014with jobs and paychecks and assignments. That\u2019s true allyship.We\u2019ve already been working to change thisIn recent years, Healthyish\u2014and BA as a whole\u2014has begun some of the difficult work of addressing these problems. We\u2019ve been lucky to have Priya Krishna, a contributing writer, working with Healthyish and pretty much every part of BA to set goals for diversity and inclusion and hold us accountable to them. For my part, I\u2019ve committed to hiring at least one new freelancer of color a month at Healthyish. I\u2019ve committed to paying freelancers higher than the standard digital rate whenever possible. At least thirty percent of our recipes are already inclusive of communities of color (that could mean the recipe developer is a person of color, or the technique, ingredients, or dish as a whole is not Euro-centric). And I\u2019ve committed to quarterly check-ins to assess our progress toward these goals.We have more work to doHere\u2019s where recent events have changed my thinking. While the goals I mentioned are about all communities of color, I want to make some commitments to Black communities specifically. I recognize the need for more Black staff at Bon App\u00e9tit, especially at the senior level. Second, I want to expand our network of Black freelance writers to share their perspectives on whatever topics interest them most\u2014not just race. (If you want to write for Healthyish, email me: amanda_shapiro@condenast.com.) Third, I want to publish more stories by and for our Black readers, like BA staffer Jesse Sparks\u2019 guide to mental health resources. And, lastly, I want to help our non-Black audience become better allies by talking more about the barriers to wellness that Black people face and what the rest of us should (and should not) do to help.I know I sound like I\u2019m running for office here, but I don\u2019t know how else to make these commitments to you all, our Healthyish readers, clear. I love this community, and I want to do better for you. Please hold me to it.Until next week,Amanda ShapiroHealthyish editorExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyish NewsletteressayHealthyishRead MoreLifestyleIf You Care About WellnessBy Amanda ShapiroRecipes you want to make.
