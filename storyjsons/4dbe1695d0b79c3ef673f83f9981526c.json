Heavy enough to serve with a red wine, as well.  Delicious!CJ LewisTroy, ID12/29/2021This recipe was a great way to use leftovers! Lots of compliments on the creative way this incorporated leftover grilled turkey and duck. I added most of a container of fresh spinach, leftover grilled brussel sprouts, leftover roasted garlic and cubes of roasted butternut squash. This recipe is definitely going to be repeated & shared! I did not bake it the full 50-60 min. I probably removed it from the oven at 40 min...very bubbly at this point.  Really a crowd pleaser!JKBadger21Eagle River, WI11/29/2021Carol Y and I think the same way. I too was wondering why so long in the oven ? I would put it under the broiler until brown and bubbling....that should do the trick. Recipe sounds interesting though.Big JoeMontreal, Canada11/19/2021If the turkey is leftover and already cooked, why would you need to bake it for 50-60 min?
