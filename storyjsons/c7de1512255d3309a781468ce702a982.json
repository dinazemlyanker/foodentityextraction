(Don't look at me like that, it was a free upgrade!) And while getting to board first and all that extra legroom certainly didn't suck, those luxuries paled in comparison to one small, simple gesture: When I ordered a gin and tonic, it was served to me in a real glass. An actual glass! Made of glass!  I was sipping an alcoholic beverage from a clear vessel made out of melted sand at 30,000 feet. I felt like A Million Dollars.And you know who else will feel like A Million Dollars? All of your friends when you invite them over to your house for a party and have real glasses for them to pour their beverages into instead of a stack of disposable plastic cups. And no, I'm not talking about the random assortment of branded pint glasses you stole from bars in college\u2014nice glasses, ones that match and feel good to hold in your hand and aren't too big or too small. It's classy! It's grown-up! It's better for the environment! And before you groan about being asked to buy more stuff, just relax: The glasses you're looking for are affordable enough to buy in quantity, durable enough to survive a party, and low-profile, meaning they're easy to stash on a high shelf until you need them again. Where can you find glasses that fit this description? Well, right here, of course! Here are six options you should buy right now.Chelsie CraigWe've said it before and we'll say it again: When it comes to durable, stackable, iconic glassware, Duralex is the reigning champ. These simple cafe glasses will never go out of style, and we'd love to see even your clumsiest friend try to break one.Buy It: Duralex 4\u215d-oz.

Bonus: They're low-profile enough that they can do double duty as bowls for olives or ramekins for individual puddings.Buy It: Bormioli Rocco Bodega Modern Red Wine Glasses, $30 for 16 from Bed Bath & BeyondChelsie CraigSturdy, no-nonsense, restaurant supply store-chic. We're big fans of red wine that tastes like juice, so what better vessel to drink it out of than a sturdy little diner-style juice glass?Buy It: Libbey 5.5-oz. Heavy Base Juice Glass, $18 for 8 from Home Depot.Chelsie CraigLike the Libbey juice glasses above, but fashion. A bit taller, a bit more sophisticated, these are the glasses your cool aunt who sometimes bums you cigarettes after Thanksgiving dinner has in her loft.Buy It: 7-oz. Unie Tumblers, $18 for 6 from Bed Bath & BeyondChelsie CraigThe. Price. Is. Right. Daaaaamn, IKEA! Back at it again with the inexplicably-cheap version of the thing you can get for more-expensive elsewhere!
