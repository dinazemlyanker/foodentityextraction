We asked 80 of the most interesting people we know to reveal the local spots they love the most.I\u2019ve made the six-hour flight from New York to California approximately 50 times in the past 28 years, for really no other reason than to aimlessly putter around my grandparents\u2019 house in Santa Cruz. An engineering professor from central Pennsylvania, my grandfather had dreams of growing old in a university town by the beach. My grandmother, on the other hand, did not, but when my grandpa bought a small house on a whim in 1990, she reluctantly followed him and lived there until she died in 2009.People hanging out outside of the diner.\nPHOTO BY KELSEY MCCLELLANThe one place where I\u2019ve consistently eaten during all those visits is an unassuming little place called Linda\u2019s Seabreeze Cafe. It\u2019s your standard breakfast-and-lunch-only spot where the egg specials come with a pile of greasy, crispy home fries; every plate is garnished with an orange slice and parsley; and you pray that whoever sat at the table before you didn\u2019t double dip their spoon into the jam jar. There\u2019s often a wait (a good sign!), but luckily there\u2019s a coffee pot, mugs, and benches set up outside so those 20 minutes don\u2019t feel too dire. Wall-to-wall carpeting absorbs the sounds of the 14 tables filled with locals ordering \u201cthe usual\u201d and day-trippers fueling up before heading to the beach.The tuna salad sandwich, complete with orange wedge.\nPHOTO BY KELSEY MCCLELLANDepending on the time of day, I\u2019ll either get two fried eggs with toast or a tuna salad sandwich. I\u2019m well aware that I can make both of those dishes just as well in my grandpa\u2019s kitchen, but that\u2019s exactly why I love it. It\u2019s familiar food that I can eat in peace\u2014the latter being something that\u2019s hard to come by at my grandpa\u2019s home, which functions as a headquarters of sorts for my mom\u2019s quirky, and some might say dysfunctional, side of the family. My mom and her five younger siblings fight over everything from how clean the cutting board is to who last moved my grandma\u2019s ashes (true story\u2014as of 2014 they were placed in the closet of the guest bedroom). Something is always broken and waiting on my uncle to fix\u2014last time I was there it was the hot water and the dishwasher. When the craziness becomes too much to process\u2014like when my uncle dumped a freestanding spiral staircase from the flea market in the driveway\u2014I'll grab whichever immediate family member happens to be nearest and escape for a breath of fresh air. And five minutes away, in the calming wall-to-wall carpeted dining room of Linda\u2019s, with a Diet Coke and a too-large side of potatoes that I will inevitably finish, I know I can always get it.Elaheh Nozari is the commerce editor at Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious.ContentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Explore Bon App\u00e9titNeighborhood RestaurantsRecipes you want to make.
