And as someone who grew up in L.A., I\u2019ve eaten a lot of tacos. For years I believed no flour could compare to the delicate earthiness of fresh masa, but once I took a bite of Sonoratown\u2019s costilla taco, my whole worldview changed.Teodoro Diaz-Rodriguez Jr. and Jennifer Feltham\u2019s cult L.A. taqueria is dedicated to specialties from San Luis R\u00edo Colorado, a city in the Northern Mexican state of Sonora. That means carne asada grilled over a mesquite wood fire, wrapped in handmade tortillas made with melted lard and soft wheat flour driven up by in small batches from Sonora by Diaz\u2019s mom. (They used to drive huge shipments across the border but stopped after a few difficulties with border patrol.)It\u2019s an extreme commitment to sourcing ingredients, but Sonoran flour does make a difference.Samin Nosrat even made numerous attempts to replicate these transcendent tortillas with all-purpose, cake, and Italian \u201c00\u201d flours, but none of them made the cut. Flour with high protein content creates dough with greater elasticity and structure, and Diaz and Feltham say that American flour (which is milled with higher-protein wheat than Sonoran flour) makes harder and heavier tortillas.So instead of settling, Sonoratown goes to great lengths. Luckily the resulting tortillas are worth it. They\u2019re supremely chewy, mildly porky, and impossibly thin\u2014the perfect wrapper for tender carne asada, pinto beans, and charred poblanos. Then the tacos are topped with two charred scallions, a fistful of lime wedges, and a two-tone splatter of salsa rojo and avocado crema.Of course I inhaled my two tacos in minutes. Then I returned to the counter with a sheepish smile, because how had I thought I\u2019d eat just two? The taquero locked eyes with me, and before I even uttered a word, grabbed a nearby napkin dispenser and rang it like a cowbell, shouting seconds! Next time, I know to double my order from the start.Go there: SonoratownExplore Bon App\u00e9titLos AngelesRestaurantsHighly RecommendRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
