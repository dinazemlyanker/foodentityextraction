When she\u2019s not in her Hudson Valley kitchen making food, the writer,\u00a0podcast host, and bestselling author is talking about it. In this essay, slightly adapted from her new (and very Healthyish!) cookbook, Simply Julia, Turshen confronts the negative feelings she\u2019s harbored toward her body for years.\u00a0In having the privilege to write a book that\u2019s all about healthy comfort food, I think it\u2019s important to be honest about my feelings about my own body while suggesting all sorts of things you can cook to feed yours. It\u2019s important, also, to acknowledge that these feelings are evolving.Related: The Myth of Healthy Eating with Christina Chaey and Vanessa RissettoContentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.For as long as I\u2019ve always loved food, I\u2019ve also been as con\ufb02icted about consuming it. A few years ago it really hit me how much time and energy I had spent feeling bad about myself, especially about my body. And that made me feel really sad. So I decided to start untangling the knot. I knew it wouldn\u2019t magically untie itself just because I wanted it to. I had to get some help.What did that help look like? So many things. I tackled hard stuff in therapy; I changed who I follow on social media to learn more about people who had broken free from diet culture; I researched what diet culture actually is; I read books and listened to podcasts about intuitive eating and shame and vulnerability; and I started to speak more openly to my closest friends about their relationships to their bodies. I began to talk honestly with my mother about how much I absorbed from watching her not treat her own body with kindness. I stopped (I\u2019m trying to stop) asking my wife, Grace, to reassure me that my body is okay. I hid my scale in a closet, and then, one day when I finally felt ready, I threw it away.I\u2019ve had a handful of breakthrough feelings throughout this ongoing shift. One was, after many gentle suggestions, Grace finally got me to watch The Matrix and it\u2019s given me the most helpful framework to think about diet culture. Now when I think about it, a culture that prioritizes thinness and urges us to keep comparing ourselves to each other so that we\u2019re left feeling really isolated, I simply think, Oh, that\u2019s not actually real.Another major breakthrough was when I realized I had limited my range of feelings to just two options. It hit me one day like a splash of cold water in the face. I had only ever felt two things in my life: happy or fat. I remember feeling like a light switch had turned on in a dark room. Oh, that\u2019s what\u2019s been going on in here.For so long, whenever I felt fat, or what I deemed fat, it was almost always a way to describe anything other than happy. Not only had I equated \u201cfat\u201d with \u201canything other than happy,\u201d I had set up a tidy, miserable binary for all of my feelings to fit into.How did I get to this restricted emotional place? Through the same roads so many people I know have also traveled. I inherited body image and weight issues; I internalized the bullying I experienced when I was younger when I was told repeatedly that I was fat and understood it to be an insult. What else? I un\ufb02inchingly accepted the idea that thin is ideal, and I put myself in close proximity with people who didn\u2019t challenge any of this. I listened to doctors tell me I was overweight according to charts whose problematic origins I didn\u2019t ask about, and I didn\u2019t push for more information when they told me my blood work was great, but I should still lose some weight. I didn\u2019t ask them why. I put my head down.It should not feel revolutionary to say, especially coming from the author of a cookbook that\u2019s about healthy cooking, that fat does not equal bad or unlovable. But it\u2019s worth saying.So how did I begin to dig my way out of this dark hole? I started to believe my wife when she said there was a version of my life that didn\u2019t revolve around feeling bad about my body. I started to change who I was talking with and looking at and listening to. I followed the money and started questioning all of the programs and people who were telling me my life could be so much better if only you did this thing I am selling you. I realized they stay wealthy if I stay desperate. I dug into the things that made me feel all the things other than happy. I started to question how I measure happiness. I learned how many different, and more loving, barometers exist. I made an effort to stop using the word \u201cshould\u201d (I even got a tattoo of it, crossed out, on my arm). I stopped equating \u201cfat\u201d with \u201cbad.\u201d I watched the \u201cFat Babe Pool Party\u201d episode of Shrill on television so many times (written by Samantha Irby, one of my favorite writers, and developed by Lindy West) and went from crying to smiling.I became an observer of myself. I bought an \u201cEMOTIONS\u201d poster, the kind you see in little kids\u2019 classrooms that list tons of emotions and depict a child making a face that represents each. I made myself go look at the poster to figure out what I was actually feeling in the moment and which emotions they were tied to.It turns out that the more I understand my range of feelings, and actually feel them, the more I get to know myself. I\u2019m a more imperfect, silly, and complicated person than I ever knew. I screw up a lot. I bump into so many things all of the time, literally and figuratively. I rewrote this very essay at least a dozen times. And that\u2019s okay.Just like cooking, I work on feeling my feelings on a daily basis. Sometimes it\u2019s really challenging. Each time I willingly step outside of the framework I grew so accustomed to, I encounter things like pain, anger, sadness, embarrassment, and fear. All of those things that fall under \u201canything other than happy.\u201d But I\u2019m also encountering more love, joy, confidence, and satisfaction than I ever knew was possible. I am learning what it feels like to not merely accept my body, but to understand that there\u2019s nothing wrong with it. To love it. To know that no matter how much space it takes up in the world, it\u2019s worthy and I\u2019m grateful to live in it.It should not feel revolutionary to say, especially coming from the author of a cookbook that\u2019s about healthy cooking, that fat does not equal bad or unlovable. But it\u2019s worth saying. There is nothing wrong with being fat. The only thing wrong is thinking that any person, living in any type of body, is less valuable than someone else.From the book SIMPLY JULIA by Julia Turshen. Copyright \u00a9 2021 by Julia Turshen.
