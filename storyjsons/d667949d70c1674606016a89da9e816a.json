But a loaf that\u2019s baked in the Nordic Ware fluted loaf pan emerges like a butterfly from a cocoon: intricately designed and absolutely stunning, an entirely different creature. With its undulating curves and star-like design, the Nordic Ware pan transforms even the plainest carrot cake or banana bread into a beauty queen\u2014no glaze or dusting of powdered sugar necessary (though it sure is nice).I mean, just look at it!\nPhoto by Chelsie CraigIf you, like me, are risk-averse, you might be wondering how on earth you\u2019re going to get the cake out of the pan in one piece while preserving the elaborate pattern. Good news: This pan is nonstick\u2014like, actually nonstick.But that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re off the hook completely: You still should spray the pan with baking spray (nonstick spray that also contains flour) or butter every nook and cranny, then dust with flour and tap out the excess. However, nonstick here does mean that if you do your share of prep, the pan will work in your favor, and you\u2019ll be able to turn out a photo-worthy loaf (not an oxymoron) every time.And while my loaf cake\u2019s beauty was mostly the pan\u2019s doing, I give you permission to take credit for your future cakes. Half the fun of baking, after all, is showing off.Photo by Chelsie CraigNordic Ware Anniversary Loaf Pan$35.50 at The BA MarketExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendShoppingRead MoreshoppingSilicone Mats Are So Nonstick, You\u2019d Think They Were Crafted By AngelsBy Sarah JampelRecipes you want to make.
