Preserved lemons win top marks in the categories of acidity, salinity, and tang, and fresh lemons (no offense, still love you!) just don\u2019t compare.\u201cIt\u2019s like a lemon on steroids,\u201d associate food editor Zaynab Issa says. Savory, bright, and citrusy, preserved lemons have an extra oomph and complexity that can\u2019t be replicated by fresh fruit. Here\u2019s how to cook with them, how to buy them, and why you should make them a pantry staple\u2014if they aren\u2019t already.What are preserved lemons?Preserved lemons are lemons (usually whole, split, or quartered) that have been packed in salt and brined in water or additional lemon juice\u2014essentially, they\u2019re pickled lemons. Especially common in Middle Eastern, North African, and South Asian cooking, they add a savory tang to everything from stews to braises, dressings, and sauces. Texture-wise, the lemons break down in the brining process\u2014the rind and pith soften, becoming squeaky, edible, and ready to fall apart with just a little heat or pressure.Preserved LemonsIf you can find Meyer lemons, use them. Their thinner skin has very little bitterness.View Recipe\u201cThey have a depth of flavor that is salty and savory and complex; think of the difference between a cucumber and a pickle,\u201d writes Sahadi\u2019s co-owner Christine Sahadi Whelan in Flavors of the Sun. \u201cUnlike sumac or lemon juice, even finely minced preserved lemon retains its own character,\u201d which Sahadi Whelan identifies as funky earthiness. \u201cRather than blending in, [it announces] itself with a burst of sharp flavor.\u201dHow do you use preserved lemons?While raw lemon peel and pith can be bitter, preserved lemons have a much more mellow flavor\u2014yes, the peel is edible and there\u2019s no tedious extra step of peeling or removing it. That means you can drop half a preserved lemon into a braise and let it perfume the whole dish.The flesh of lemons that are cut before they\u2019re preserved will absorb more salt than those that are packed whole. In order to control for salinity, many recipes will call for discarding the super-salty flesh and using only the rind, or for rinsing the preserved lemon before cooking with it. Both measures can help you to better control the seasoning of your dish.If a recipe calls for paste, it\u2019s as simple as taking whole preserved lemons, removing the seeds, and blitzing them in a food processor or blender until you achieve uniform consistency.Where should you use preserved lemons?Add finely chopped preserved lemons to a hearty dish that needs a hit of brightness, like Issa\u2019s Red Lentil Soup With Preserved Lemon and Crispy Garlic. Blitz them into a tangy-tart salad dressing to pour over greens and chicories. Mix the paste with harissa and use it to marinate a leg of lamb that\u2019s served with fennel and herbs. Pur\u00e9e it with creamy dairy, like labneh, feta, or ricotta. Mash it with peas, incorporate it into pasta sauce, or toss it with roasted vegetables. \u201cYou can add it to anything and get a more dramatic lemon flavor,\u201d says Issa. Sahadi Whelan calls them a \u201cone-and-done way to season and brighten just about anything bland\u201d (coming for you, beans and grains).If you\u2019re looking for some recipe inspiration, Sahadi Whelan recommends pairing preserved lemons with fish\u2014\"blend them into a compound butter and slip a pat onto a piece of broiled or grilled fish.\u201d She advises that preserved lemons also go well with green olives, \u201cas both are cured and salty, and the citrus flavor mitigates the oiliness of the olives.\"\u00a0Whatever you choose to cook, tread lightly: \u201cIt\u2019s pretty potent in flavor,\u201d says Issa, who recommends starting off by adding half of a preserved lemon to soup or a braise to begin, and then adjusting for taste afterward by adding more preserved lemon as needed.You can even take the more unconventional route and make dessert: Add pur\u00e9ed preserved lemons to Preserved Lemon-Tea Cake for a subtle hint of brininess that adds an interesting depth to a classic loaf.Or don\u2019t cook or bake with them at all. \u201cJust pull the lemons out of your fridge, and use them as a condiment,\u201d says Issa, who recommends serving thinly sliced preserved lemons on a cheeseboard, tucked in sandwiches, or splayed atop toast or pasta.Where can you buy preserved lemons?You can make your own preserved lemons (budget two weeks!), or you can look for them at Middle Eastern or South Asian grocery stores, usually in glass jars, by the pickles and preserved foods. Your supermarket may also carry them in the international aisle, or you can order them online from brands such as NY Shuk or Mina.\u201cBe choosy about the quality of the prepared ones you buy,\u201d writes Sahani Whelan, who prefers Moroccan-sourced preserved lemons. \u201cLook for firm, well-shaped lemons that are not mushy or mashed too tightly into their jars.\u201dJars of preserved lemons can keep for months in the refrigerator and may develop a deeper pickled flavor and softer texture over time. \u201cShake the jar now and then to keep the lemons moist; otherwise the salt may rise to the top and form a crust,\u201d says Sahadi Whelan. If you do find that the salt is crusting over, just scrape it off and you can continue to use it.While you can buy paste, whole lemons are more versatile, as they can be minced, chopped pur\u00e9ed, or left whole as needed. Issa recommends Meyer lemon preserved lemons, which she says are sweeter and more floral.Next time you find yourself stocking up on way too many lemons\u2014yes, this is a self-roast\u2014reach for preserved lemons for that extra citrusy boost.Pucker upPreserved-Lemon Tea CakePreserved lemons rein in the sweetness in this plush olive-oil-based loaf.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titcookingRecipes you want to make.
