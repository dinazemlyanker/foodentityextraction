Across Greece there are myriad variations of \u2018xoriatiki\u2019 or Greek salad. \u2018Xoriatiki\u2019 literally just means \u2018village style\u2019 so whatever village you\u2019re from determines the type of variant of tomato/cucumber/feta salad you eat. In my family there\u2019s a long-standing debate whether to use red wine vinegar or lemon as the acid\u2026so guess what\u2026we use both. My aunt grows her own peppers, tomatoes, and GOOD cucumbers, so guess what, we use all of that. Also, that\u2019s not nearly enough olive oil. Just sayin. #greeklikemeAnastasia GreekLikeMeGreece6/29/2021Improved Greek Salad???? - sorry Andy Baraghani but I believe you should call it \"a different kind of Greek Salad\" Since the traditional Greek Salad consists of tomato, cucumber, green pepper, onion, olives, feta cheese, dry origano - In some parts of Greece they add capers as well.lexeeGreece9/5/2020Easy and nice twist on the classic Greek salad.Anonymous8/22/2020After spending a lot of time in Crete, it seems like sacrilege to claim you can \"improve\" on horiatiki - but this is damn good. Pull out your best olive oil and go to town; I could've eaten a plate of the charred lemons alone. I will absolutely make this again once cherry tomatoes are ripe and bursting. \"Healthyish\"? Not really, but what a recipe!janemontgomeryWashington DC6/7/2020Greek salad sans lettuce is actually authentic greek village salad- it's called horiatiki! Love the charred pepper and lemon updates to the orig nonetheless. Yum!AnonymousLake Geneva, WI10/10/2019As with all recipes deliciousness hinges on the quality of your ingredients. Full of flavor feta, fresh veg, and tasty oil are vital. I made as a Fri night dinner so I felt it needed more substance and added a bed of fresh mixed lettuce plus olive garnish and warmed pita bread. Everyone agrees this is a repeater. Would have given it 5 stars if it was quicker with less clean up.snowdayCharleston, WV9/21/2019Explore Bon App\u00e9titSaladFetaCheeseCherry TomatoTomatoVegetableCucumberPaneerSummerQuickEasyWeeknight MealsSideMainGluten-FreeNut-FreeVegetarianKetoHealthyishLunchDinnerRecipes you want to make.
