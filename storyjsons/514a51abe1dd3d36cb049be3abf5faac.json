When something's so easy to make that you don't even need one. Welcome to It's That Simple, a column where we talk you through the process of making the dishes and drinks we can make with our eyes closed.Each May I marvel at how the earth works so quickly to provide us with food for our table (morels! asparagus! garlic scapes!) and how it puts on an invigorating show of blossoms and new leaves at the same time. Rhubarb follows the spring playbook perfectly; it\u2019s a wonderful thing to use in the kitchen, in all its tart glory, but it\u2019s also a real stunner, dressed up in bright pink, proclaiming its yearly rebirth with more than a little panache.If you\u2019re like me and never want rhubarb season to end, making a shrub will help it last just a little longer. Shrubs are a broad category of \u201cdrinking vinegars,\u201d made by employing sugar and vinegar to create a liquid product meant to be mixed with other ingredients and imbibed. Typically, shrubs are served with soda or used as part of a cocktail. I rely on them to take the place of liquor in non-alcoholic drinks, or to play the role of Campari in a 1-1-1 Negroni template. These \u201cdrinking vinegars,\u201d as they\u2019re also known, were very popular in the American colonial era. And, compared to canning, stirring together a shrub is simple. It requires a few days of time and very little effort.My approach is very easy and a bit different from other recipes I\u2019ve seen, but trust me, I\u2019ve tried various methods and this recipe works with many different combinations of fruit, sugar and vinegar. In honor of the fleeting rhubarb season, here\u2019s how to make rhubarb-mint shrub or, as I like to think of it, spring in a bottle.Here we go! Slice 4 medium stalks of rhubarb crosswise until you\u2019ve got 2 cups of it. Mix together 1\u00bc cups sugar (preferably organic) and \u00bc teaspoon kosher salt in a small bowl. Pick the leaves off a couple sprigs of mint and clap them firmly between your hands once (this is to release the essential oils). In a large jar or container with an airtight lid (I like glass best, plastic is a good alternative, but avoid metal), layer the rhubarb and mint evenly with the sugar mixture. Seal the jar and turn it upside down a couple of times. Now, let it sit on the counter for a few hours. (If it\u2019s hot out, just an hour or so will do! The juices are drawn out of the rhubarb more quickly at higher temps.) You want to see a fair amount of liquid in the jar at this point. Put your jar into the fridge overnight.Photo by Michelle HeimermanTwenty-four hours after you first combined the sugar mixture with the fruit, add 1 cup red wine vinegar. (I love this kind of vinegar, which amplifies the beautiful color imparted by the rhubarb here, but if you don\u2019t have it, try apple cider or white wine vinegar). After adding the vinegar, leave it at room temp for a few hours, then taste it to see if it needs more vinegar (up to \u00bc cup more). Turn the jar upside down a couple times, and put it back in the fridge for a minimum of 24 hours. If you can, try to wait longer, up to two days more, so the flavors can develop further.Photo by Michelle HeimermanWhen it\u2019s ready, strain out the solids and bottle it. (Save the spent fruit! Editor Sarah Jampel is going to eat these sweet-tart \u201cpickles\u201d with yogurt, but you can also use them to garnish the cocktail that follows.) It\u2019ll keep nicely in the fridge for six to eight weeks, but much longer if you keep it tightly sealed and save it for later use (i.e. you\u2019re not exposing it to air by opening the container often).You can, of course, just top 1 oz. of shrub with some soda and call it a day, but you could also try a very easy drink. It\u2019s a spring special that mimics the 3-2-1 template of a spritz but in an unexpected order. Into a Collins or wine glass, pour 1 oz. rhubarb shrub and 3 oz. something dry and bright, like white wine, fino or manzanilla sherry, or dry vermouth. Add ice and top with a couple ounces of good-quality tonic. For garnish, skewer one side of a lemon wheel, then arrange three pieces of your spent rhubarb on the pick, and skewer the other end of the lemon (it should look like three little rhubarbs wearing a lemon jacket). If you want to make this non-alcoholic, try replacing the wine with over-steeped white or Sencha tea.Photo by Michelle HeimermanNow that you\u2019ve learned the art of the shrub, the possibilities are endless: peaches with white wine vinegar and granulated honey in the summer; cranberries, brown sugar, and apple cider vinegar in fall; or pineapple with white sugar and Champagne vinegar for a tropical number in the wintertime. Indeed, there is a shrub for all seasons but, for now, you\u2019ll find me keeping rhubarb season alive for as long as I can.Explore Bon App\u00e9titIt's That SimpleshrubCocktailRecipes you want to make.
