When something\u2019s so easy to make that you don\u2019t even need one. Welcome to It\u2019s That Simple, a column where we talk you through the process of making the dishes and drinks we can make with our eyes closed.It\u2019s a sign of the times that out of all of the delicious-sounding recipes in Nadiya Hussain\u2019s new book, Time to Eat\u2014like Sticky Coconut Rice with Tempered Pineapple and Pizza Parathas (OMG) and Speculoos Cookie Sheet Cake\u2014I immediately gravitated toward the simplest one of all. Nadiya\u2019s Choc Bar Puffs consist of three ingredients, all of which are easily kept on hand (frozen puff pastry, chocolate bars, one egg), and require almost no equipment. Just flaky, buttery dough encasing melted chocolate, they\u2019re maximum comfort for minimum effort, which is sort of the premise of Nadiya\u2019s whole book, as well as her wonderful Netflix show of the same name.And while it would be dishonest to say that the era of project cooking has ended for me (in a fit of election-related anxiety, I made pizza, enchiladas, vareniki, and anpan over the course of one week), I can say that preparing complicated recipes, and then cleaning up the aftermath, has lost its glow. I\u2019ve learned that just because I have no plans on Friday night (not this one, not the next one, forever and ever, amen) and can, theoretically, make croissants, that doesn\u2019t mean I should make croissants. But the Choc Bar Puffs? They take an hour, max, and are as satisfying and impressive as anything I could bake entirely from scratch.To make them, start by defrosting two sheets of puff pastry (from one box of Pepperidge Farm or two of Dufour). I never remember to defrost puff pastry in the fridge overnight, so I just use the shortcut in this Spinach and Feta Tarte Soleil recipe: Put it on a baking sheet and watch it carefully.\u00a0Meanwhile, break or slice eight chocolate bars in half crosswise so that you have 16 shorter pieces. The choice of chocolate is up to you, but you\u2019ll want to make sure the bar is plain (not chock-full of nuts and other add-ins), meltable, and made from ethically harvested beans. (FWIW, I like Guittard, Valrhona, and Alter Eco.) Crack an egg into a bowl and whisk it to make an egg wash.On a lightly floured piece of parchment paper, roll out one sheet of puff pastry (you can keep the other one on the baking sheet; stow in the fridge if it\u2019s getting sticky). Your goal is to get the dough big enough that it can fit 15 of the chocolate pieces\u2014five across and three down\u2014with about \u00bd inch of pastry in between. (Yes, you will have one extra chocolate bar half. I\u2019m sure you know what to do with that.)Once the chocolate is snug on its squishy mattress, transfer the pastry to a baking sheet (parchment and all), shove it in the fridge, and roll your second piece. You want it to be slightly bigger than the first one\u2014it\u2019s going over the top. Take the baking sheet out of the fridge, arrange the chocolate pieces, then brush all of the visible dough with egg wash. Egg wash is the glue that holds the pastry sheets together, so be diligent. Place the second piece of pastry on top of the first and press gently so the dough adheres on all four sides and in the chocolate gaps. Let the baking sheet hang out in the fridge while your oven heats to 400\u00b0F.Final stretch! Transfer the pastry-chocolate sandwich to the cutting board (again, use the parchment to assist you), trim the perimeter so it\u2019s neat, and cut between all of the chocolate bars so that you have 15 rectangles. At this point you can freeze the pastries (in a single layer on a lined baking sheet; transfer to a bag when frozen solid) if you\u2019re not ready to bake them. Otherwise, distribute them among two parchment-lined pans, brush generously with egg wash, sprinkle with flaky salt (optional but recommended), and bake for 20\u201325 minutes, rotating the pan halfway through, until deeply golden and delightfully puffy. (Once they\u2019re cool, you can also freeze them at this stage.)Dust any you\u2019re going to serve with cocoa powder (also optional but recommended) and eat while slightly warm so that the chocolate is gooey. Dip them in hot cocoa! Save some for breakfast! They\u2019re almost like chocolate croissants.Maybe one day I\u2019ll feel motivated to make my own puff pastry to stuff with chocolate bars. But for now I\u2019m taking Nadiya\u2019s cue and doing what\u2019s reasonable and easy and just as delicious. Forget the elaborate cinnamon rolls\u2014these are my holiday breakfast plans.Time to Eat: Delicious Meals for Busy Lives: A Cookbook$27 at AmazonExplore Bon App\u00e9titIt's That SimpleRecipes you want to make.
