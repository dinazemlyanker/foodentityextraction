But sometimes you need to listen to those who know what they\u2019re talking about\u2014no matter who they might be.\u201cDad, here\u2019s what you should do,\u201d my son, Marlon, explained to me while sitting at the kitchen table a couple of weeks ago. \u201cYou need a midseason drop.\u201d\u201cWe can do that?\u201d\u201cYes \u2014gosh!\u201dPhoto by Alex LauMarlon isn\u2019t the first tween to think his dad is a total noob. But in this instance I got it: I needed Marlon more than he needed me. A few months back, Bon App launched an online merch store at shop.bonappetit.com, and I quickly realized that our target audience\u2014thanks in part to our burgeoning YouTube channel and our social media platforms\u2014is a lot closer to Marlon\u2019s demographic than mine.Fortunately, BA\u2019s 20-something design staff is plenty current too. And the more I looked at what Marlon was wearing, the more I noticed that was what the team was dreaming up: long-sleeve tees, logo\u2019d hoodies, tube socks, fanny packs, and, if we can find a maker, bucket hats. (They\u2019re a thing again\u2014really.)In a way, turning to an 11-year-old for insight isn\u2019t that different from what I do every day at work. When I\u2019m wondering what chilled red wine to take to a party or what cocktail I should be concocting, I text our wine editor, Marissa Ross, and drinks czar, Alex Delany. When I need a restaurant in L.A.? I drop by deputy editor Julia Kramer\u2019s office. When I want the recipe for that chicken biryani I\u2019ve been sampling over and over in the BA Test Kitchen? I slack associate food editor Sohla El-Waylly.Photo by Alex LauAs anyone responsible for running a brand will tell you, it\u2019s imperative that you know what you don\u2019t know and that you surround yourself with people who are a lot smarter than you.Photo by Alex LauWhich is how and why we finally have our own online shop. Our creative director, Michele Outland, and design director, Chris Cristiano, worked tirelessly on the products, constructing mood boards and sourcing piles and piles of samples. A whole gang of people on our marketing and licensing teams figured out how to strike distribution deals, and a certain opinionated, streetwear-obsessed tween kept the boss on point.We \"dropped\" a bunch of products earlier this month, and we have even more coming later this week, most of which should arrive just in time for Christmas, if you order right away. Check in with our Instagram feed for when our new merch goes live. And just like that, you've crossed at least a bit of your holiday shopping off your list.Get Shopping:The BA Merch ShopExplore Bon App\u00e9titAdam NewsletterRead Morecooking12 Kitchen Gifts I Really Want But Definitely Don\u2019t NeedBy Alex BeggscultureAll the Gifts You Want, Curated By the Coolest People We KnowBy The Bon App\u00e9tit StaffshoppingThe 38 Best Gifts for BakersBy Sarah JampelshoppingMolly Baz's 11 Essential Tools Also Make Great GiftsBy Molly BazRecipes you want to make.
