Ask your fishmonger before you buy\u2014it really makes a difference. To make them easier to grill, we thread the scallops onto sets of two skewers, not one, so they don't spin around willy-nilly when you pick them up. Then hang the skewers off the edge of the grill so you can pick them up with your (gloved) hands\u2014no need for tongs.Ingredients4 servings\u2153cup mayonnaise2tsp. fresh lime juiceKosher salt1toasted nori sheet1tsp. ground coriander\u00bdtsp. ground ginger2Tbsp. vegetable oil, plus more for grill12large dry sea scallops, side muscles removed, patted dry\u00bdlime3scallions, dark green parts only, very thinly sliced1tsp. Aleppo-style or other mild red pepper flakes or gochugaru (coarse Korean red pepper powder)Special EquipmentA spice mill; eight 8\" wooden skewers, soaked at least 1 hourPreparationStep 1Prepare a grill for medium-high heat. Mix mayonnaise, lime juice, a pinch of salt, and 1 Tbsp. water in a small bowl; set lime mayo aside.Step 2Finely grind nori in spice mill. Transfer half to a small bowl; set aside for serving. Transfer remaining nori to a large bowl and mix in coriander, ginger, and 2 Tbsp. oil. Add scallops and toss to coat.Step 3Thread 3 scallops onto 2 skewers. (This will keep scallops in place and make them easy to turn. You can also use this method for shrimp and small peppers like shishito and Padr\u00f3n.) Repeat with remaining scallops and skewers. Season both sides with salt.Step 4Clean and oil grate, then immediately place scallops on the outside edge of the grill so that the skewers are hanging off the side. Grill, turning scallops with handles of skewers, until grill marks appear and scallops are just cooked through, about 3 minutes per side, depending on their size.Step 5Spread lime mayo on a platter and place skewers with scallops on top. Finely grate zest from lime half over, then squeeze juice over. Top with scallions and sprinkle with Aleppo-style pepper and reserved nori.How would you rate Grilled Scallops with Nori, Ginger, and Lime?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (6)Back to TopTriangleExcellent recipe. We seared the Scallops on a heated nonstick pan, flipped once and turned off the heat.\nServed with Rice, Seaweed Salad and good Sake. Perfect combo. Thanks to everyone at Bon App\u00e9tit !MNew Orleans LA3/12/2021A terrific recipe! I agree about not adding water to the mayonnaise! Added lime juice instead. AnonymousAlexandria, VA12/7/2020Ok these are so good. Did these in my cast iron (no skewers) and served with white rice to soak up the richness. The two of us demolished these and wish I made moreAnonymousSan Francisco 10/1/2020Great, pretty, and tasty alternative to regular wine, butter, garlic, or so scallops.  Very easy to make and prepare, took little time.  I didn\u2019t have a spice mill and had a hard time grinding the nori.  I ended up with a bag and chopper, and that helped but I ended up with flakes more than fine pieces.  It didn\u2019t seem to affect the taste.  I followed the directions for the Mayo-lime spread and it worked out fine and was delicious.  The Aleppo-style pepper was hard to find, and it really only added to the appearance.  You could use paprika instead.  puzzledMinnesota6/30/2019Oh my! This is spectacular. I know I'm a throwback to Miracle Whip, added the recommended water, but it needed more lime juice. I didn't have Nori on hand, so I substituted Wasabi Furikake. It was a marriage made in heaven. An uncomplicated recipe that tastes like five stars! Definitely will make this again!angkbWashington 6/20/2019Made this last night. Asparagus is in season so we grilled a bunch alongside the scallops. Didn't add water to the sauce because I thought it would be too watery and I was right. Added a half teaspoon more of lime juice instead. Came close to licking the plate clean--the asparagus made good mops for any remaining sauce. Definitely making this again.Brimfield, Massachusetts6/7/2019Explore Bon App\u00e9titSkewerScallopShellfishSeafoodSummerMainNut-FreeDairy-FreeGluten-FreeKetoHealthyishGrillingMemorial DayLabor DayDinnerRecipes you want to make.
