At home, he likes to make double or triple batches of the coconut milk curry (see his recipe for All-Purpose Coconut Curry here) and freeze it in two-cup portions. Then, when he\u2019s ready for dinner, all he has to do is defrost a portion and sear pieces of spiced whitefish that finish cooking in the reheated curry. If you want to prepare this recipe with premade curry, bring 2 cups curry to a gentle simmer in a saucepan over medium-low heat, then add the seared fish to the pan and simmer until the fish is opaque and flakes easily.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Working in batches to avoid crowding, cook fish pieces until lightly browned, about 2 minutes per side (the fish won\u2019t be cooked all the way through). Transfer fish to a plate.Curry and AssemblyStep 3Heat grapeseed oil in a medium Dutch oven or other heavy pot over medium-high. Add a few mustard seeds to pot. When seeds start to wiggle and pop, reduce heat to medium and add curry leaves (if using), asafetida (if using), and remaining mustard seeds. Cover pot and cook spices, swirling, until mustard seeds start popping more gradually, about 30 seconds. Uncover pot and return heat to medium-high. Add ginger and garlic and cook, stirring constantly, until beginning to brown, about 1 minute. Add chopped onion and a big pinch of salt and cook, stirring often and reducing heat if needed to prevent burning, until onion is golden brown and jammy, 7\u20139 minutes.Step 4Stir in turmeric, then tomatoes and bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to medium and cook, stirring often, until tomatoes are glossy and darkened in color and oil starts to separate around edges of pot, 5\u20137 minutes.Step 5Add coconut milk and broth and stir to combine; season with salt. Bring curry to a simmer, then reduce heat to medium-low. Cover and cook, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking, 10 minutes.Step 6Add fish to curry. Return to a gentle simmer and cook until fish is just cooked through and flakes easily with a fork, about 4 minutes. Taste and season with more salt if needed.Step 7Divide fish curry among bowls.

Family loved it Suni DHuman Race 1/23/2022As written, this would be about a 3 star dish but with some changes it was delicious. I left out the broth as the sauce was already too thin for my taste (I like my curry to coat the back of the spoon, and this was more like a broth consistency already). I also subbed in 2T of curry powder in place of the leaves; I just couldn\u2019t find any even at Indian grocers, but it didn\u2019t feel like it would be robust enough just leaving thot out. Next time I\u2019ll do the same but allow it to cook down for longer to thicken up. DalOakland, CA11/1/2021This was delicious. I made it a bit more spicy (personal taste) and added carrots and spinach but the base was perfect. Possibly fishsauce instead of salt? Thanks for the recipe, will repeat.RichardArgentina10/31/2021This was amazing. Kind of a Thai Indian fusion. The gentle sweetness of the coconut milk worked perfectly with the savory spices, onions and fish chunks. AnonymousSouthern Maryland10/12/2021My picky partner approves = automatic 5 stars  AnonymousVictoria, BC10/6/2021I\u2019d add some chili or cayenne to the curry, not just the fish. Susan C.Brevard, NC10/3/2021Extremely riffable. I cut down the onions by half, and eyeballed the coconut milk (1 can seemed like a lot - but that's just my preference). I also added chickpeas since I didn't have anywhere near the amount of fish required. End result was delicious - just don't forget the lime and cilantro! AnonymousCanada10/1/2021Delicious, simple, hearty. It came together very quickly. I made it with halibut. Will definitely make again.MegBC9/24/2021Did it with shrimps instead. This is amazing, so good, I've had two bowls.
