I nabbed one featuring not-Oatly-but-suspiciously-similar strawberry oat milk and another featuring frozen chunks of cheesecake. At the checkout aisle, a chatty cashier looked me and my partner up and down and asked, \u201cyou guys headed to the beach?\u201d and I had to reply, \u201cno, we just dress like this.\u201d In the summer, everywhere is the beach if you wish it so.Here are sweltering reviews of my latest TJ\u2019s haul, written beneath my brand-new, worth-every-penny ceiling fan:SnaaaaacksCrispy Onion ChipsIncredible. The texture is foamy and light, with sweet onion flavor and nothing else in the way. I like them crumbled on top of things, but you\u2019ll want to eat them straight out of the bag while the Pythagorean Theorem and the division symbol and a bunch of numbers hover around your head as you try to figure out\u2026.how. They must dehydrate the onions before frying, right? How do they do it?? I\u2019d say these are Funyuns\u2019s hip, younger cousins who squeal in horror at dextrose and whatever else puts the Fun in Funyun (ahem, MSG). These are just onions, rice bran oil, and salt. HOW?Spicy Porkless Plant-Based Snack RindsThese pea and puffed rice \u201crinds\u201d look like prehistoric falcon claws excavated from a cave of barbecue-chip seasoning. I\u2019ve called a million snacks styrofoam-y at this point, but I\u2019m bringing the word up again because it\u2019s accurate. If you associate barbecue-chip flavors with pork, then sure, these are \u201cporkless pork rinds,\u201d but that\u2019s a poetic stretch if you ask me. And yet no one, no one has asked at all, have they?Strawberry & Jalape\u00f1o CrispsWhoooooweeee these have some heat. And then a chewy, weirdly sweet strawberry aftertaste. Dissonance, cacophony, a baby screaming at a Metallica concert. Adding a cheese\u2014like brie\u2014calms down the chaos, but only slightly.Key Lime Kettle PopcornThis isn\u2019t sitting right with me, but I keep going for another handful. If you like Froot Loops, that same not-quite-lime flavor really comes through. It\u2019s tart and sour in a way no one invited popcorn to be. So I appreciate its nerve. How about toasted coconut kettle corn instead? Hot honey kettle corn? I have ideas. Joe, call me.Hatch Chile and Cheddar Seasoned PopcornFor the fact checkers among us: This came out last year but I never got my paws on it, okay? The popcorn has that industrialized pop look: Each kernel is super big and airy and resembles a recently unearthed skull. Trader Yorick! The heat is warming but not HOT, and that\u2019s about my passion level for this popcorn.Canned BoozPi\u00f1a Colada SmoojSpiked! Seltzer! Smoothie! The new 3 S\u2019s. I\u2019m in Michigan, where Smooj\u2014oh yeaaa\u2014is based, so I found this at my local TJ\u2019s and had to pick it up. In writing, it\u2019s the worst idea. Carbonated...smoothie? But I\u2019m telling you, it works, baby. The fizzy, creamy drink tastes like a pi\u00f1a colada and has the fat content to match. Not fat-shaming, just letting you know that unlike other spiked seltzers full of nothingness and stevia, this is carbonated coconut cream with real sugar and everything. Love ya, Smooj.Yes Way Ros\u00e9 Pink Lemonade SpritzOnce my mother-out-of-law bought a bottle of Yes Way Ros\u00e9 from Whole Foods and I was like, \u201cYeah, I like that.\u201d Every time I\u2019ve gone over to her place since, she\u2019s bought another bottle. That\u2019s love. But this spritz is entering a competitive field. I got a chance to taste an Aussie ros\u00e9-lemonade and I liked that muuuch better\u2014check it out. The balance here was off, the lemonade flavor muted, and the \u201cFrench ros\u00e9\u201d hitting like a wine left out on the picnic blanket too long. Needs an extra squeeze of lemon on top to revive.JuiceSpicy Mango LemonadeHere\u2019s what I do. Cold brew some hibiscus tea by filling a little tea bag or ball with a tablespoon of hibiscus I bought in bulk last year, put it in a mason jar, fill with water, and let steep an hour or more in the fridge(it won\u2019t oversteep). Then I fill a glass with ice, fill \u00be with the hibiscus tea, and top it off with this spicy lemonade. The first sip is spicy, but the rest is less spicy, sweet, and tart from the hibiscus. This lemonade is the BEST mixer at Trader Joe\u2019s right now, especially if you\u2019re the chick who always orders the spicy margarita on the menu. You know who you are. Sarah.Chocolaty ThingsOrganic Sea Salt & Nibs 63% Dark Chocolate BarThe nibs are so broken up that they give this bar a great sparkly crunch, which is fun to eat. And at 63% cacao, it\u2019s not too bitter. Could even be fun to chop this up for fancy chocolate chip cookies.Dark Chocolate Coffee Buzz BarsThe dark chocolate is so intense I could only eat one square of the 70 gram caffeine bar, about the equivalent of four sips of coffee. It left a bitter aftertaste, like when you\u2019ve got coffee breath five hours after breakfast and should really brush your teeth already, or get some gum, sheesh. If you love chocolate and need to stay awake at the wheel, go for it.Chocolate & Peanut Butter Joe Joe\u2019s Sandwich CookiesPicture a Girl Scout Tagalong that\u2019s swallowed a peanut butter-filled Oreo\u2014sorry, Joe-Joe\u2014and that\u2019s what we\u2019re dealing with here. Double-decker decadence. The peanut butter-powdered sugar frosting instantly smushes, smears, and stains every fabric you encounter the second you grab one. Or again, maybe that\u2019s the heat.Amped-Up AlmondsReally confused why these don\u2019t have espresso or Adderall in the coating. Misnomer! The chocolate is thick and chalky, hiding a tiny, flavorless almond underneath.Candy Coated Chocolate PeanutsNot sure if it\u2019s the heat or a candyman with an artistic vision, but the color on the shell was speckled and faded, like Cracker Barrel decor. The green was a calming, sage green, which I hear is on trend. Otherwise, these dusty-looking, wannabe peanut M&M\u2019s are doing exactly what they\u2019re trying to.In the Freezer AisleBranzino Fillets European Sea BassAh yes...the European...Sea. Origins aside, inside this bag are four roof shingles of branzino, which I made into a decent curry. You could do the same.Mini French BaguettesChewy breadsticks win the award for being the second-most phallic food at TJ\u2019s, but soy chorizo won\u2019t be beaten! These are all texture and otherwise flavorless. Crisp exterior, chewy inside, ready for soup season.Wildberry Cheesecake Ice CreamBig blueberry flavor with chunks of cheesecake folded in. Dairy upon dairy. This has an element of something dreamed up in a bathtub, and I like that about it.Strawberry Non-Dairy Oat Frozen DessertPeople are fawning over Oatly\u2019s new strawberry ice cream and whaddya know, TJ\u2019s has one too! It\u2019s good. Flecks of supposed almond brittle in the cream taste soft and dry and not sweet or brittle-like\u2014could do without them. The oat milk ice cream base is great, though.Cheeses and NEW! DIP!Kerrygold Irish Cheddar with Chili PeppersMild cheese, mild pepper, mild thoughts.Beemster Hatch Pepper GoudaThis is spicier than the Kerrygold (but not thaaaat hot) and very creamy. I shredded it and made wonderful nachos. Different TJ\u2019s have different cheese offerings, but if you can get your hands on this, buyyyy.Everything And the Elote Greek Style Yogurt Dip\u201cAnd the elote\u201d means we\u2019ve got little bits of corn in this dip, which was controversial among my taste-testing buddies because it adds a touch of sweetness (and slightly slimy texture). I liked the pops of kernel, see y\u2019all tomorrow! We\u2019ve got Greek yogurt as the base (fine), some parm (yess), and TJ\u2019s everything-but-the-elote spice mix, which relies mostly on chipotle, cumin, and chile powder. Demolished this dip with TJ\u2019s ridged not-Ruffles.Pantry ItemsCassava Cauliflower Blend Baking MixRight off the bat, I could smell the cauliflower and I DON\u2019T LIKE THAT. I thought making Rick\u2019s sugar cookies would be a good test of the flavor/composition of this gluten-free flour blend. The cookie texture was great, soft and tender, but you could definitely taste the cauliflower. Faces were made. Yucks were yucked. Cookies were literally tossed. Structurally, the gluten-free flour works and that\u2019s cool, but the taste...no. I think a simple rebrand, labelling it \u201cSavory Baking Mix\u201d and giving people recipes for pizza dough and zucchini bread, not PANCAKES and COOKIES, would fix the potentially hazardous results made with this flour.Organic Canola Oil SprayHow many spray oils does a person need? This one would come in handy when your niece gets her head stuck in the railing of the front porch. Nice n\u2019 greasy.Mexican Cowboy Pinto BeansThese charro beans are great. Big fan. Creamy pinto beans, decent jalape\u00f1o presence, and a hint of smokiness. The seasoning\u2019s strong without being killer salty. Now I\u2019m excited to try more from this new brand.Peri-Peri SauceHOT. Sauce. Fermented chiles give it that funky, hint-of-yeast taste, which I love\u2014but every so often you also get a chile pepper sliver. A good amount of lemon juice makes the sauce very acidic and bright. A little goes a LOUD way. I\u2019ll mix it with mayo for sandwiches, tacos, and roasted vegetables.Organic Peach Fruit SpreadOpened this up and saw a perfect peach slice on top, which surprised me because so many Trader Joe\u2019s \u201cfruit spreads\u201d are so far from jam they have to call them \u201cfruit spreads.\u201d Peaches, sugar, pectin, not much else in here. A keeper.Explore Bon App\u00e9titTrader Joe'sLifestyleRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
