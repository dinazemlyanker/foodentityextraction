I used it for a wedge salad.  PamIllinios2/4/2022Delicious! I didn\u2019t have any tahini on hand so I substituted some hummus instead. Anonymous2/4/2022The dressing is to die for - I keep some in my fridge at all times. I prefer to chop the cabbage to make more of a chopped salad and I added crispy shallots cooked in the bacon fat.Casey BAtlanta, GA2/1/2022This salad was excellent! Restaurant quality flavor in about 15 minutes. I used reduced-sodium soy sauce and the dressing came out perfect (to my taste). I didn\u2019t have Napa cabbage but found standard green cabbage to be just as tasty and still worked for the flat disk presentation. And a big gold star to Chris for giving us lazy cooks a dressing where everything is just poured into a blender and whirred to magic perfection. I didn\u2019t miss mincing herbs, shallot and garlic, reaming citrus, whisking this into that, and slowly drizzling oil into this here bowl. Phew. Just blend it up, baby!  Thank you very much. Spatulacity Los Angeles 1/26/2022Who knew raw napa cabbage could taste so good!!! The dressing is on the saltier side (miso, soy sauce, etc.) so if you are not a big fan of salt, you should opt to not salt or very lightly your cabbage prior to dressing. \n\nIf you loved this, you will also love Chris' Corn & Chickpea Bowl with Miso-Jalape\u00f1o Tahini - so much flavor!\n\nP.S. @Chris, keep the Miso & Tahini combos coming!SKBrooklyn, NY1/21/2022all the best flavors of a complicated cobb with none of the work! i kept the cabbage in raw discs (as opposed to searing) and replaced chives with green onion as it's what i had on hand. my finished plate looked just like the picture and i happily scarfed it down.moonbeamsanta cruz, ca1/9/2022I would like to give much appreciation to my boy Chris Morocco for another great recipe. This recipe flavor wise was off the hook. This recipe comes together very quick making it an ideal weeknight dinner. I cut my Napa cabbage into actual wedges and seared them Carla Music. Just wanted to say thank you to Chris and Carla for the awesome techniques.TheJBT88Escondido, Ca1/7/2022Explore Bon App\u00e9titDinnerSaladEasyWeeknightNapa CabbageCabbageLeafy GreensVegetableTahiniCondiments, Sauces & PastesBaconCured MeatMeatMisoDairy-FreeWinterSideRecipes you want to make.
