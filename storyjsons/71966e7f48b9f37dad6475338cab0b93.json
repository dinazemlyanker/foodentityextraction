FREYTESFacebookTwitterEmailThis is part of our series that celebrates America\u2019s Favorite Neighborhood Restaurants. We asked 80 of the most interesting people we know to reveal the local spots they love the most.As soon as the pilot announces that we are about to make our initial descent into the San Juan airport, I\u2019m smiling with complete abandon. After the customary round of applause that signals a smooth landing, I look at my boyfriend, Jack, and squeeze his hand\u2014it\u2019s his first time coming to Puerto Rico and meeting my family.My mom picks us up and immediately asks the most mom question of them all: \u201cAre you hungry?\u201d Every time I fly home, there\u2019s one essential first stop. We drive 20 minutes to Pi\u00f1ones, an area known for its beaches and mangroves, but more importantly, its fried food.Everything is deep-fried in lard.\nPHOTO BY JAVIER J. FREYTESSay you are going to Pi\u00f1ones, though, and everyone knows that where you\u2019re really headed is the small stretch of route 187 dotted with little roadside kiosks that sell typical Puerto Rican food and beer. We call them chinchorros. They vary in size, from open-air restaurants to a few tables and chairs under a zinc or wooden roof. But the one thing they all have in common is a glass vitrine that displays the very-recently fried food. Everything is deep-fried in manteca, or lard. Hanging out at these spots is such an important part of our culture that we\u2019ve turned it into a verb: chinchorrear, to spend a day going from kiosk to kiosk eating and drinking. Hurricane Maria hit this area pretty hard, but Puerto Ricans were already back in Pi\u00f1ones two weeks after the storm, seeking the thing that would make them feel human again.The place we always go.\nPHOTO BY JAVIER J. FREYTESWe arrive at El Rinconcito Latino, our usual spot. There\u2019s loud salsa music playing, and just a few feet away, the sun shines bright upon the surface of the ocean.First, I order my favorite, a bacala\u00edto. It\u2019s a golden brown deep-fried pancake-ish thing made from a mixture of cod and flour that\u2019s generally bigger than my head. The woman behind the deep-fryer hands it to me on a napkin that\u2019s already translucent; it\u2019s no match for the grease that covers its surface. Sometimes I just eat around the bacala\u00edto, ripping all the super crispy edges first with my fingers so I get them while they are still hot and brittle. Then I give the leftovers to my stepdad, bless him. I wash it down with an ice-cold Medalla, a light Puerto Rican beer that may as well be our water.The alcapurria, in all its fried glory.\nPHOTO BY JAVIER J. FREYTESNext is an alcapurria, a long, dark-brown oblong cylinder of green plantain and taro root (although the best and rarest ones are made with yucca) that\u2019s stuffed with ground beef or crabmeat. Jack douses the alcapurria with hot sauce and my stepdad hands him a beer.For the rest of the trip, Jack will ask if they have alcapurrias everywhere we go. I\u2019m proud that it\u2019s one of the first Spanish words he\u2019s learned. Another round of Medallas. Another round of alcapurrias and bacala\u00edtos. Our family cheers to the ritual indoctrination that\u2019s taken place: Jack has passed the first test.Laia Garcia is the deputy editor of No Man\u2019s Land.ContentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Explore Bon App\u00e9titNeighborhood RestaurantsPuerto RicoRecipes you want to make.
