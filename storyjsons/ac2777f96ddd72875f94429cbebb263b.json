Here, associate food editor Rachel Gurjar uses it as a taco filling, fragrant with ground lamb, tomatoes, onions, garlic, and spices. You can make the keema a day in advance and save any leftovers to spread between buns for a sloppy Joe\u2013style sandwich or serve with rice for another quick weeknight meal.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

It's pretty easy, and packs a flavor punch (if you make it right). I do think that some of the quantities are off in the recipe here -- as some have noted, the recipe in the magazine said 1 lb of lamb, while this says 2. I've made it both ways now and 100% recommend either using 1 lb lamb or *doubling* the spice mixture. Some have also said double the onion and it makes it sweeter. I also don't use corn tortillas, but rather make Andy's super easy flatbreads and use it more like I would naan. Erin L.Brooklyn, NY12/3/2021So incredibly tasty, and a ton of flavor. They definitely are sloppy joes on a tortilla, so the second round I just put it in a bowl and dipped a rolled tortilla with it. It was quick, easy, and everything I wanted out of this meal.MeghanHouston, TX11/7/2021Very good flavors. This is a keeper\n\nFollowing are the recipe changes I made; a number of them were suggested in other comments:\nUsed 1 lb ground lamb instead of 2 (note that I DID NOT half other ingredients)\n6 cloves garlic instead of 4\nChicken broth instead of water\nCooked lamb ahead, drained, and reserved grease\nUsed lamb grease instead of EVOO to cook onions, garlic, etc\nAdded 4 diced Calabria chiles (from jar)\nReduced on simmer for 20-25 minutes to thicken\nWe added shredded lettuce in addition to raw onions and Greek yogurt for serving.\n\nThe only other change I would make is to 1/2 the cumin seeds, as cumin flavor dominates a bit.MarkOlmsted Falls, OH10/22/2021Wonderful flavors just as is. We ate it just like chili with yogurt and cheddar cheese on top!LynneMorgantown WV10/7/2021Delicious, but kind of a mess.\n\nThe keema was pretty simple to whip up without too much effort and tasted great. But it has the consistency of sloppy joe filling, and putting that into a soft taco shell just did not work. The tortilla just isn't absorbant or watertight enough to hold the fillings.\n\nDoing it again, I'd season it a little more heavily and either serve over rice, or if I was committed to the fusion thing I'd put it into a burrito with rice.AnonymousSeattle, WA10/7/2021The flavor was great.  Love the mix of spices.  But next time I will cook the the ground lamb separately and drain its fat before mixing it with the rest.  I also didn't love the taco and wonder what else I could have put it on.  AnonymousNew Canaan, Ct10/5/2021Super delicious and easy. I couldn't get lamb and used a combo of ground beef and pork. Go slow browning the aromatics and spices. Made a huge vat that will be even better tomorrow.Anonymous9/15/2021BA is 2/2 for great surprises on this meal prep day. My local TJ's didn't have lamb so I got pork instead, and stuck to 1 lb. This worked out well as with less meat, the spice ratio seemed to be perfect. I did use all the herbs as other commenters have suggested, and used veggie broth instead of water. Because there was less meat it only needed to sit on the stove for about 10 minutes rather than 20. Beautifully flavored end result. BilliePittsburgh, PA9/5/2021Wasn't for us - the crema was the best part which says a lot. I could see where we were going with this, but the texture / lack of punch makes it blandAnonymousChicago9/4/2021This is a keeper. As others have stated, do not skimp on the herbs, and I would actually add some more onion to make it a little sweeter. This is the same as the magazine version (that I followed), but for this recipe adds mint (which I did), and doubles the rest of the ingredients. Frankly, it was so good that I wish I would have used this version rather than the magazine version to have plenty of leftovers. :)ShawnIndian Beach, NC9/2/2021This recipe is different than what was in the magazine (1 lb of lamb instead of 2)- any rec as to which I should use?MaddieWashington, DC9/1/2021This was so easy and delicious. Don\u2019t skimp on the herbs and lime juice at the end. We had it with Greek yogurt and pickled onions on corn tortillas. It would make a great lettuce wrap on warm evenings.
