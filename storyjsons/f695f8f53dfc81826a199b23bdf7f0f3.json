By giving the grits a good rinse, bringing them up to a boil from cold, and cooking them slowly and with frequent stirring, Hall ensures maximum creaminess without any dairy. The dish is rounded out with tomatoey shrimp and fresh fennel fronds. Making the Fennel Potlikker is a crucial first step here, so be sure to read through that recipe first.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

The fennel potilkker gives the grits a subtle, but beautiful flavor.Altha2/27/2022Terrific shrimp and grits. I used Ouzo instead of Pernod for the potlikker which worked well.
