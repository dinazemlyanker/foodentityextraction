See our past recommendations here!If I were to describe my ideal beverage in four words, not a single one would be plucked from the phrase \"lightly brewed sparkling tea.\" But if you were to magically appear on my roof on a summer weekend afternoon, you\u2019d see me lounging in a chair, drinking a beautifully designed can of...lightly brewed sparkling tea.This is a testament to either A) an intensifying identity crisis that I am undergoing or B) the straight-up delectability of Minna sparkling teas. For the sake of reputation, I\u2019m going to say it\u2019s the latter.I\u2019ve always steered clear of sparkling teas because they tend to be so syrupy and sweet, but Minna\u2019s three flavors don\u2019t have any added sugars. The tropical green tea is filled with hints of passionfruit and pineapple, and the citrus black tea ropes in tannins and bright citrus for a spritz-like experience. But the lime hibiscus tea is currently riding high at the top of the sparkling tea power rankings. The tang of the lime and the delicate floral nature of the hibiscus make me feel like I\u2019m drinking the world\u2019s lightest Berliner weisse, which\u2014as those who know me even in the slightest will attest to\u2014is a beverage I enjoy a lot.I really didn\u2019t see this newfound love coming. But in a world of syrupy tea drinks, Minna is the shining light(ly brewed sparkling tea). \u2014Alex Delany, associate editorBuy it: Minna Organic Sparkling Tea, $26 for a 12-pack.All products featured on Healthyish are independently selected by our editors.
