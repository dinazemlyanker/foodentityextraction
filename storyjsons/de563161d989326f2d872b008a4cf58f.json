Bacon. Scones, butter, cream, jam. A pot of Lapsang souchong tea. And some sausages.By Alex BeggsJanuary 17, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailFocus FeaturesFacebookTwitterEmailAfter seeing Phantom Thread, you\u2019ll either be craving mushrooms\u2014or you\u2019ll never want to eat them again.\nBut no, it\u2019s not a movie about food, exactly. This is the Paul Thomas Anderson movie you may have heard about because everyone adds, \u201cDaniel Day-Lewis\u2019s last movie before he retires\u201d to their plot synopses. Other than Daniel Day-Lewis\u2019s last mad hoorah, it\u2019s a beautiful, twisted story about a dress designer in the 50s, named Reynolds Woodcock (I can\u2019t) and his lover/muse, Alma, played by Luxembourg native Vicky Krieps. You can break the film into chapters between four breakfast scenes, pointed out by the New Yorker critic Anthony Lane, ending in a final, wild omelet dinner that I won\u2019t spoil for you.My personal favorite, the scene that I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about after I left the stale-butter scented theater, was the first breakfast, in which Reynolds meets Alma at a hotel restaurant in the country. I spoke to Krieps about filming the scene with the obsessive method actor, which was not only the first time the characters meet, but also the actors (though with Day-Lewis, they\u2019re one in the same).Woodcock is a powerful designer with persnickety tastes and always has a look on his face like he\u2019s just gotten a whiff of himself and the smell is God. Alma is a waitress at the hotel, and they can\u2019t take their eyes off each other\u2014especially after she trips over a table leg and blushes deeply.When it\u2019s time to order, he looks her in the eyes and slowly requests: Welsh rarebit with a poached egg. Bacon. Scones, butter, cream, jam. A pot of Lapsang souchong tea. \u201cAnd some sausages,\u201d which cracked up the entire theater I was in. It seems like a flirtatious and light meet-cute scene\u2014he\u2019s hungry for her, obviously. And she\u2019s willing to cater to his every need and then some sausages, for now. But as the movie progresses you see how calculated and symbolic the moment really is beyond the scope of these two fictional characters\u2019 strange-as-hell relationship.Krieps prepared with a waitress at the Victoria Hotel in Robin Hood's Bay who gave her some pointers, like serve from the right and turn the tea cup to the customer so he can easily grab it. But the lesson was as much about the practical details as the unspoken ones: \u201cEveryone working in service knows that it\u2019s one of the hardest things you can do,\u201d she said, \u201cyou have to completely forget your own needs because you have to function. And if you have a bad day, you still smile. And if your back is hurting you still walk.\u201dAll we can guess about Alma, whose backstory isn\u2019t touched upon in the movie, is that she comes from a working class family and has unquestionably accepted her place. \u201cHe could go on for five hours and she\u2019d have to stand there and take the order,\u201d said Krieps, \u201cIt\u2019s interesting that their relationship starts on such a clear power dynamic, where he is very much above her and she is very much beneath\u2014and then it\u2019s going to turn around.\u201dWhen Alma enters his world of fancy embroidery and plentiful martinis and asparagus with olive oil, never butter, it\u2019s clear that everyone in Reynolds\u2019s life is serving him. And the man is needy. Alma nearly gets exiled from the house after scraping butter on toast too loudly (some of us can relate), and as tensions build, she realizes that the person taking orders might be the servant, but the one cooking dinner is in control. Without spoiling anything, let\u2019s say that a guide to edible vs. poisonous mushrooms comes into play, a mortar and pestle has a minor starring role, and you haven\u2019t seen a romance quite like this before.Phantom Thread has a 92% on Rotten Tomatoes right now.
