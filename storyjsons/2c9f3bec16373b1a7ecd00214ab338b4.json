But instead of succumbing to the anxiety-driven rhetorical question cycle\u2014Where did the time go?! Do I have any other ideas beyond quirky dish towels?!\u2014we\u2019re asking ourselves very different questions this year. What\u2019s the thing that people like cartoonist Liana Finck and designer John Derian can\u2019t stop thinking about? What kind of kitchen gear are chefs like Kwame Onwuachi or Margarita Manzke actually excited about? What would Eva Chen do? But these questions aren\u2019t rhetorical: We actually asked these people\u2014and a whole lot of other chefs, winemakers, artists, writers, bakers, shopkeepers, and Instagram influencers that we know, love, and trust implicitly\u2014for all their gifting picks this season. And then...we decided to share all that intel with you here.

Then we saw this one and just thought, \u2018Why didn\u2019t we think of that?\u2019 The A\u0300plat Culinary Dish Tote. A\u0300plat is so smart. It allows you to carry things horizontally: casseroles, cobblers, avocados and stone fruit and other things from the farmer\u2019s market that you don\u2019t want to stack up on each other and bruise. In the past, we used a piece of cardboard and a brown paper bag to transport pies and baked things to friends\u2019 places. This is a much nicer presentation for something you\u2019ve labored over for three hours. Whenever we bring it out, we get lots of \u2018ooohs.\u2019\u201d \u2014Michelle Mungcal and Ken Concepcion, owners of Now Serving in L.A.Buy it: A\u0300plat Culinary Dish Tote, $64 at A\u0300platPhoto by Alex Lau, prop styling by Rebecca BartosheskyThe Opener With a Sense of Humor\u201cI\u2019ve always enjoyed collecting little objects because they make me feel like I\u2019m home. Now I have a revolving crew of tiny things I\u2019ve picked up as I\u2019ve grown and moved around, mostly fruits and vegetables by different makers, like this Spoon & Tamago Brass Lotus Root Bottle Opener. It\u2019s quiet and understated. And I like that it\u2019s heavier than it looks. It\u2019s a tangible way to root yourself in the world.\u201d \u2014Liana Finck, New Yorker cartoonist and illustratorBuy it: Spoon & Tamago Brass Lotus Root Bottle Opener, $72 at Spoon & TamagoPhoto by Alex LauThe Pretzels Worth Buying by the Bucket\u201cLancaster County, Pennsylvania, is home to Martin\u2019s Pretzels, which makes one thing and one thing only: the best pretzels I\u2019ve ever eaten. When I first had them, I was blown away by the crunchiness, the super-salty bites, the deep flavor that\u2019s developed from the long baking, and the sourdough tang. All that makes them great to eat on their own, but I go a number of different routes now. Into them with cream cheese. Or really spicy mustard like French Dijon. Or you can melt 72% dark chocolate and dip them in there. That\u2019s actually a business I\u2019d like to open one day. No one\u2019s taking a good pretzel and making chocolate- covered pretzels. After pizza, that might be my calling.\u201d \u2014Joe Beddia, chef-owner, Pizzeria Beddia, PhiladelphiaBuy it: Martin\u2019s Pretzels, $23 at AmazonPhoto by Alex Lau, prop styling by Rebecca BartosheskyA Wine Club We\u2019d Actually Join\u201cWe\u2019re both into wine, and when we recently remodeled our apartment on the third floor of Elske, we finally had the space to get a dedicated wine fridge. We gravitate toward wine shops where we feel like we can just trust the recommendations from the staff, and that\u2019s the thought process behind a lot of the wine subscription clubs these types of shops run. In Chicago, Diversey Wine has an amazing club that really highlights the natural wines they stock at the shop. They include high-acid whites with characteristics of beer and cider and lighter reds that we like to chill. But really, we like that they choose for us. We own a restaurant. We\u2019re pretty busy people... with a wine fridge.\u201d \u2014David and Anna Posey, chefs and co-owners, Elske, ChicagoBuy it: Diversey Wine, $50 a month for two bottles at Diversey WinePhoto by Alex Lau, prop styling by Rebecca BartosheskyThe Tablecloth That\u2019s Runway-Ready\u201cI\u2019m not a clothes shopper. When I walked into Nigerian designer Busayo Olupona\u2019s Brooklyn store, I planned to be in and out. Instead, I spent three hours admiring prints, trying on pieces from her clothing collections, and chatting. As soon as I saw the Ileshin Print Table Cloth, I knew I needed one.\u201d \u2014Yewande Komolafe, chef, recipe developer, and writerBuy it: Ileshin Print Table Cloth, $105 at BusayoPhoto by Alex LauThe Tiny Teapot With a Big Impact\"I found this Hario Cha Cha Kyusu \u201cKaku\u201d 450 ml Teapot while my husband and I were opening our restaurant, L\u2019Auberge Carmel in Carmel-by-the-Sea, California. We love how the glass shows off the tea\u2019s color. We still use the teapots, and we get more compliments on them than the tea itself.\u201d \u2014Margarita Manzke, pastry chef, Re\u0301publique, L.A.Buy it: Hario Cha Cha Kyusu \u201cKaku\u201d 450 ml Teapot, $18 at AmazonPhoto by Alex LauThe Knife Stand That Keeps Things Sharp\u201cAs a chef I try out a lot of products. Most of them aren\u2019t good. That\u2019s why I was surprised when I got into Material\u2019s Knife Stand. I really like the midcentury-modern vibes, its clean lines, and how cool it looks in my kitchen. It also keeps knives sharp since they don\u2019t rub against each other.\u201d \u2014Kwame Onwuachi, chef, Kith/Kin, Washington, D.C.Buy it: Material\u2019s Knife Stand, $75 at Material KitchenPhoto by Alex LauThe Wine Importers\u2019 Favorite Winter Spirit\u201cThis spirit is based on Malo\u0308rt, the notorious Chicago liquor we force our visiting friends to take as a shot. But Letherbee Be\u0308sk is a totally different experience, much more refined, with notes of wormwood and rosemary. When winter rolls in, we sip it slowly\u2014straight or mixed into cocktails.\u201d \u2014Olen Amelia and Ben Deter, wine distributors, Minum Selections, ChicagoBuy it: Letherbee Be\u0308sk, $30 at Binny'sPhoto by Alex Lau, prop styling by Rebecca BartosheskyThe Master Baker\u2019s Trusty Bread Knife\u201cOver the years I\u2019ve used a lot of bread knives, and they unfortunately all have one thing in common: They\u2019re moderately good for a moderate period of time. That\u2019s not the case with my 10.75\" Tojiro Bread Knife. At home I eat bread every day. My wife, son, and I go through about three loaves of bread a week, and if you know the bread we bake at Boulted, you know there\u2019s some aggressive crust on our levain loaves. This knife\u2014which is sturdy, balanced, and not too heavy\u2014slides straight through them, even after using it multiple times a day for about a year. All I really need to do is control the direction of the blade. There\u2019s no fighting with it. It feels so natural. Bread is a really important part of my life, and this makes it even more enjoyable. I love this knife. Really.\u201d\n\u2014Joshua Bellamy, baker and co-owner, Boulted Bread, Raleigh, NCBuy it: 10.75\" Tojiro Bread Knife, $63 at Cutlery and MorePhoto by Alex Lau, prop styling by Rebecca BartosheskyThe Napkins That\u2019ll Make Mom Proud\u201cMy parents have a thing for napkins. Much to their chagrin, my children and I are horrible cretins who use paper towels (I know!), if anything (even worse!). But that\u2019s changed this year thanks to these Bauhaus-inspired Blockshop Textiles Lil Nan Napkins. My mom is going to be so proud.\u201d\n\u2014Emma Straub, novelist and owner of Books Are Magic, BrooklynBut it: Blockshop Textiles Lil Nan Napkins, $14 each at Blockshop TextilesPhoto by Alex Lau, prop styling by Rebecca BartosheskyThe Retro Pots That Still Wow\u201cWhen I was a kid, my mother swore by CorningWare Visions Cookware. I had forgotten all about them until recently, when I found a set in a random kitchen supply store. I fell in love with them again when I saw how these glass stew pots make food sparkle.\u201d \u2014Kalen Kaminski, prop stylist and founder of UpstateBuy it: CorningWare Visions Cookware, $120 for five-piece set at CorningwarePhoto by Alex Lau, prop styling by Rebecca BartosheskyThe Tortilla Press This Fashion Editor Lives For\u201cCorn tortillas are one of my favorite foods. Growing up, I would eat them with jam and butter for breakfast whenever I visited my dad in Mazatla\u0301n. That was my madeleine moment. Since then I\u2019ve always wanted to make my own tortillas, but I was missing the press. That\u2019s because I keep a very minimal kitchen\u2014I only have three knives. Then I got Gabriela Ca\u0301mara\u2019s My Mexico City Kitchen. It was the final push I needed to buy my Chef\u2019s Secret Red Tortilla Press. I tried looking for the presses in her book, but they were too big or expensive. So I spent an hour reading reviews on Amazon until I found this beautiful red one. The first few weeks, I messed around with online recipes. I tried cooking with coconut oil, lard, nothing. Now I just follow the recipe on the Bob\u2019s Red Mill masa harina bag. I use my press at least once a week just to make two or three fresh corn tortillas. I\u2019m pretty sure my obsession has ruined tortillas for the rest of the people in my life, but I don\u2019t care.\u201d \u2014Stella Bugbee, editor in chief, The CutBuy it: Chef\u2019s Secret Red Tortilla Press, $16 at AmazonPhoto by Alex Lau, prop styling by Rebecca BartosheskyThe Cheesy Star of the Snack Table\u201cMy friend Kathleen Cotter, who runs the Bloomy Rind in Nashville, introduced me to this semisoft Julianna Capriole Goat Cheese. Biting into it, you get all the flavors of the herbes de Provence and marigold petals, then the funk and creaminess of the cheese. I immediately asked for a wheel.\u201d \u2014Vivek Surti, chef-owner, Tailor, NashvilleBuy it: Julianna Capriole Goat Cheese, $38 at Gourmet Food WorldPhoto by Alex Lau, prop styling by Rebecca BartosheskyThe Ladle That Turns Serving Into an Art\u201cI have a few ladles from Japan, but this Lue Brass Ladle handmade by Ruka Kikuchi is by far the best. I first discovered his brassware while traveling in southern Japan a few years ago. It\u2019s functional yet beautiful, a ladle you can use in the kitchen but also bring tableside to serve guests.\u201d \u2014Jeni Afuso, photographer at DYLAN + JENIBuy it: Lue Brass Ladle, $96 at Heath CeramicsPhoto by Alex LauThe Self-Care Salve\u201cAfter spending all day in the kitchen, I smell like an unnatural combination of red sauce and chocolate cake. To combat that, I shower and then apply Monk Oil City Skin Potion all over my body to feel human again. It has yarrow flower essence, cedar, and lavender, and it smells floral and earthy without being musky.\u201d \u2014Zoe\u0308 Kanan, head baker, Freehand Hotel, NYCBuy it: City Skin Potion, $56 at Monk OilPhoto by Alex LauThe Dreamy Platter That\u2019s Also Durable\u201cCeramic serving-ware is either super gorgeous and $642, or it\u2019s really inexpensive stuff\u2014and you can tell. I feel like this Year & Day Serving Platter hits that ideal in-between. I have three of these, so if my daughter puts cupcakes on it and then decides to throw it on the ground, I won\u2019t have a mental breakdown.\u201d \u2014Eva Chen, director of fashion partnerships, InstagramBuy it: Year & Day Serving Platter, $50 at Year & DayPhoto by Alex Lau, prop styling by Rebecca BartosheskyThe Little Glass That Makes Beer Taste Better\"I used to work in a bar in college, and Sam Shepard would come in and sip his beer out of a little glass. Then I became sort of obsessed with tiny vessels. It just seemed so elevated, not like big American pint glasses that feel like you\u2019re taking a swig from a fishbowl. Last year, when I was at Sushi Noz in New York City, I came across this elegant Shotoku Glass Co. Medium Usuhari Glass made by an old Japanese light bulb manufacturer. The guy next to me was drinking Asahi out of these small thin glasses. It looked so good. I ended up ordering three or four of those little Asahi. I\u2019m sure there is a beer aficionado who thinks this is sacrilege, but for me, this is perfect.\" \u2014Brooks Reitz, restaurateur behind Melfi\u2019s, Leon\u2019s Oyster Shop, and Little Jack\u2019s Tavern, CharlestonBuy it: Shotoku Glass Co. Medium Usuhari Glass, $40 at Ukiyo HomePhoto by Alex Lau, prop styling by Rebecca BartosheskyThe Lamps That Are Literally(!) Made of Bread\u201cI saw these Pampshade Bread Lamps for the first time in Paris, then reencountered them at a trade show in New York City and immediately fell for them. I\u2019m a real fan of anything that is sort of fake or has an optical illusion. I think it\u2019s so cool that they\u2019re bread, not papier-ma\u0302che\u0301. They\u2019re made by Japanese designer Yukiko Morita, who hollows out fresh loaves and other baked goods, fills them with LED lights and battery packs, and covers them with resin. There\u2019s something so funny, whimsical, and neutral about them that would make them fit in anywhere. They\u2019d be really nice in the kitchen, plugged in to look like bread that\u2019s been illuminated or in an office for a little bit of humor. It\u2019s a no-brainer for gifting because people will appreciate the personality in these and enjoy them much more than getting another scarf (especially when they already have 30).\u201d \u2014John Derian, designer and founder, John Derian Co., NYCBuy it: Pampshade Bread Lamps, from $50 at The WebsterPhoto by Alex Lau, prop styling by Rebecca BartosheskyThe Hand Soap Your Kitchen Deserves\u201cKaren Kim makes these beautiful soap bars through her company Binu Binu, all natural and handmade in Toronto. They\u2019re inspired by traditional Korean bathhouses. I\u2019ve been selling her soaps and was like, \u2018We should make a soap together.\u2019 So we created the Herriott Grace Kitchen Soap & Dish with scents to complement the kitchen, like cedarwood and eucalyptus.\u201d \u2014Nikole Herriott, photographer and co-owner, Herriott Grace, TorontoBuy it: Herriott Grace Kitchen Soap & Dish, $142 at Herriot GracePhoto by Alex Lau, prop styling by Rebecca BartosheskyThe Tea Your Winemaker Loves Unconditionally\u201cLeaves and Flowers makes a tea for just about any mood: from the buckwheat Soba Cha tea, which is nutty and toasty and just what I want in the morning before I\u2019m ready to eat, to the Leaves of Grass, which is rich and herbaceous and perfect for an after-dinner beverage thanks to lemon verbena, peppermint, and tarragon. The teas all come from small local California farms and are dried and packed by hand. Plus, I have a big clear teapot, so the whole herbs and flowers look beautiful as they brew no matter what I choose.\u201d \u2014Martha Stoumen, winemaker and founder, Martha Stoumen WinesBuy it: Leaves and Flowers, $14\u2013$17 for 1 oz. at Leaves and FlowersPhoto by Alex Lau, prop styling by Rebecca BartosheskyThe Aspirational Lazy Susan\u201cIn my book, any good dinner is served family-style. If you\u2019re not sharing, what\u2019s the point of eating with another person, right? That\u2019s why I adore the Concrete Cat Lazy Susan from Coming Soon. Whether it\u2019s a predinner cheese and charcuterie spread with a bowl of popcorn, or a lemony yogurt and za\u2019atar condiment and some spoons during dinner, or mochi ice cream and vermouth spritz ingredients after dinner, I want everyone at the table involved. And my table is beige. So this lazy Susan adds color and joy. I think that anything surrounding your dinner and/or touching your table should be fun and joyful.\u201d \u2014Sierra Tishgart, cofounder, Great Jones, NYCBuy it: Concrete Cat Lazy Susan, $265 at Coming SoonExplore Bon App\u00e9titGift GuidesShoppingHoliday 2019Recipes you want to make.
