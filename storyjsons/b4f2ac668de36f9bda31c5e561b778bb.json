Cabbage two ways! If you prefer something less spicy, replace the kimchi juice with water.Ingredients8 servings8scallions\u00bdcup kimchi, plus 1 Tbsp. juice from jar2Tbsp. seasoned rice vinegar1Tbsp. Sriracha2tsp. fish sauce2tsp. toasted sesame oil\u00bccup vegetable oil1small head of Napa cabbage16\" piece daikon, peeled, cut into matchsticks2cups store-bought shredded carrotsKosher saltToasted sesame seeds and cilantro with tender stems (for serving)PreparationStep 1Remove dark green tops from scallions and thinly slice; set aside. Blend scallion bulbs, kimchi, kimchi juice, vinegar, Sriracha, fish sauce, and sesame oil in a blender until smooth. With motor running, very slowly stream in vegetable oil; blend until dressing is thick and airy. Set aside.Step 2Tear off leaves from cabbage until you get down to the crunchy white part. Rip outer leaves into 2\" pieces. Thinly slice core crosswise until you have about 6 cups; reserve remaining cabbage for another use. Toss in a large bowl with daikon, carrots, and reserved scallion tops. Season with salt; pour reserved dressing over. Toss to coat, transfer to a platter, and top with sesame seeds and cilantro.How would you rate Spicy Kimchi Slaw?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (4)Back to TopTriangleSuperb and easyCarolThe villages fl10/12/2021This has become a go-to side for me, it is so good. I've made it 10+ times, and I've learned that a half-tablespoon of brown sugar in the kimchi dressing is a good thing if you're serving this with a main that is already salt/vinagary/spicy. The dressing is the star so sometimes when I can't find daikon I sub a big handful of thin kale ribbons or bean sprouts. Amazing recipe, family favorite.JessaminRaleigh, NC11/13/2020WOW I made this to take camping (glamping) and ate it next to a beautiful lake with the sour cream and onion potato salad peddled in the Aug. 2020 issue. insanely good!! I ate the dressing straight out of the blender, I ate the slaw until the fish sauce finally got to me. it's SO GOOD and I am bringing this to my next picnic. pro tip: I also made the kimchi toast (also in Aug 2020) for camping and it was a great way to double up on kimchi usage without being duplicative. thank you for your gifts Claire saffitz!!! jahgurlremyPortland, OR8/12/2020We made this as a sode dish with Johnsonville Korean BBQ smoked sausage. Subbed jicama for daikon. I will add a little honey for sweetness next time.
