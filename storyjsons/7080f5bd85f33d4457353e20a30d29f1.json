And now I do the same.By Alyse WhitneyJune 11, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailChelsie CraigFacebookTwitterEmailMy parents only go out to eat once or twice a month, so most of my food memories are of sitting around our four-person kitchen table, eating something simple and home-cooked. Even though my mom cooks fantastic lasagna, \u201cpoor man\u2019s steak\u201d (aka Salisbury steak), and a number of different rice casseroles, the food I most associate with going home is the pancakes my dad makes on his electric griddle.He uses a box of \u201cjust add water\u201d Hungry Jack pancake mix, \u201cwhisped\u201d\u2014the way he grew up saying \u201cwhisked\u201d\u2014gently once, and then again after the batter settles to ensure it\u2019s the right consistency. It\u2019s not the flavor of the pancakes that makes me crave them so much, it\u2019s the fluffy texture and crisp edges that form once he ladles batter onto the griddle.I can\u2019t remember a time before we had our Presto griddle sitting on top of the fridge. It has never collected dust because we used it at least once a week from when I was in grade school all the way up until I left for college. I think my dad got it at a Black Friday sale for $15, and even though it has been used for more than a decade, it has held up. Sometimes the light doesn\u2019t go on to let you know it\u2019s preheated, but he refuses to let me buy him a new one. It has history.My dad\u2019s pancake process is very specific: First, he preheats the electric griddle to 325\u00b0\u2014never any hotter, so they don\u2019t cook too fast. Then he greases the whole thing with a swipe of Crisco and keeps the container near him with a piece of wax paper so he can repeat the process if need be. (I tried using butter once when I made him breakfast for Father\u2019s Day\u2014it burned and did not give the pancakes that even crispness around the outer edge.) Instead of a ladle, he uses a \u00bc-cup measure to portion out medium-sized pancakes, lets them bubble up on one side, flips, and then immediately puts about \u00bd tsp. of butter on each pancake to melt into the surface. He usually makes 4\u20136 pancakes at a time, leaving room on the griddle to cook a few eggs over-easy. He serves everyone a small stack before he sits down. As he cooks on the counter next to our dining table, it\u2019s like watching a chef in an open kitchen. He\u2019s the best short-order cook because of this electric griddle.Add a few over-easy eggs, and that\u2019s my dad\u2019s signature breakfast.\nAlex LauAfter moving out of my parents\u2019 house, I missed our pancake breakfasts, so I bought an electric griddle and turned my off-campus apartment into a little diner. The griddle is naturally non-stick and not heavy like a cast-iron one. It's been with me through four different NYC apartments and many diner-style brunches, where I've introduced my friends to the sweet and savory sauce that the runny yolks and maple syrup form on top of the stack. I've used boxed mix, Julia Child\u2019s buttermilk pancake recipe (that I have written down in my phone because my grammy told me it was her own recipe), and Bon App\u00e9tit's pancake recipe.The griddle isn\u2019t only for pancakes and eggs\u2014I\u2019ve used it to make half a dozen grilled cheese sandwiches, warm tortillas for taco nights, burgers for a 4th of July party (where the built-in grease tray came in handy), and homemade breakfast sausage. The griddle makes it easier to cook for a crowd, and it also bridges the gap between New York City and Binghamton, NY. My dad always feels close by when the griddle is on, and when I tell him about it later, he\u2018s glad I saved money and cooked at home. Some things never change.Buy my dad\u2019s favorite Presto slimline griddle for $45 on Amazon if you can\u2019t wait for a Black Friday sale like him.Want more pancake inspiration?
