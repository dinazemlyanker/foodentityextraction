Chef and co-owner J\u00f6el Watanabe, whose own heritage is Japanese and Corsican, finds an extraordinary equilibrium between these two culinary canons that you won't find anywhere else.ORDER THE: tajarin, a take on a classic Piedmontese pasta with hand-cut, butter-slicked miso-laden noodles showered with miso-cured egg yolk and Parmigiano; the frittelle di melanzane, crunchy garlic-and-eggplant fritters with yuzu gribiche; and the seasonal whole fried fish with a delicate, sweet daikon-soy dipping sauce.THE VIBE IS: genteel, an occasion worth dressing up for. Just inside the restaurant\u2019s inconspicuous entrance, an inscribed mirror invites you to \u201cPlease fix your hair, and remove the mud from your boots.\u201d One steep staircase later and you\u2019re in a space inspired by jazz caf\u00e9s in 1960s Tokyo as well as elements from the Hotel Okura.PRO TIP: Follow the industry folks: They like to snag seats at the bar later in the evening, a clever way to avoid the always-present queue for tables.PRACTICAL STUFF: Open Tuesday to Saturday, from 5:30 p.m. to midnight. Closed Sunday and Monday. The bar is first come, first served, and a portion of the room each night is kept for walk-ins (we don\u2019t recommend groups larger than four). Otherwise, your best bet is reserving ahead of time (maximum of six guests), though they\u2019re often booked up weeks or months in advance.\u2014Lindsay AndersonIan LantermanWE ALSO LOVEThe Ramen ButcherUmami heaven and house-made noodles in ChinatownPhnom PenhA boisterous Cambodian-Vietnamese institution in Chinatown that\u2019s still going strongBeaucoupAn outstanding bakery worth the (slight) trek to KitsilanoExplore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
