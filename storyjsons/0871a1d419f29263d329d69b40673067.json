Here, developer Bill Clark also adds frozen berries for jamminess, color, and even more tart-sweetness. While these wings are great cooked on the grill for the most char, you can also bake them under a broiler, where they will take about 30 minutes.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Transfer to small bowl, cover with a damp paper towel, and chill until ready to use. Cut 1 lemon into wedges; set aside. Thinly slice 1 shallot into rings.\u00a0Play/Pause ButtonPausePlay/Pause ButtonPauseChevronChevronStep 2Heat 2 Tbsp. vegetable oil in a medium saucepan over medium. Cook shallot, stirring occasionally, until translucent, about 2 minutes. Stir in 1 tsp. Diamond Crystal or \u00bd tsp. Morton kosher salt, \u00bd tsp. freshly ground black pepper, and \u00bc tsp. crushed red pepper flakes and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute.Step 3Add one 10-oz. bag frozen mixed berries, \u00bc cup honey, 3 Tbsp. apple cider vinegar, and \u00bd cup water to shallot mixture in pan and cook, stirring often to prevent sticking and burning, until berries are completely softened and falling apart and agrodolce is thickened, 15\u201320 minutes. Taste and season with more salt, pepper, and/or vinegar if needed. Remove from heat and set aside.Step 4Prepare a grill for medium heat. (Or, if you don\u2019t have a grill, heat broiler with rack in upper third of the oven.) Pat 2 lb. chicken wings, drumettes and flats separated, dry with paper towels and arrange on a rimmed baking sheet. Sprinkle wings all over with remaining 2 tsp. Diamond Crystal or 1 tsp. Morton kosher salt and \u00bd tsp. freshly ground black pepper, pressing to adhere. (Lightly coat baking sheet with oil if broiling wings.)Step 5Grill chicken, turning occasionally with tongs to prevent excessive charring (some is delicious, a lot is not), until crisp and deeply browned and an instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of a wing registers 165\u00b0, about 15 minutes. (If using broiler, broil about 25 minutes, turning over after 15 minutes.) Transfer wings to a large bowl.\u00a0Step 6Reheat agrodolce over medium until warmed through and loose, about 1 minute. Pour over wings and toss to coat.\u00a0Step 7Transfer wings and agrodolce to a platter and top with chopped herbs. Squeeze juice from 1 reserved lemon wedge over wings. Serve wings with remaining lemon wedges for squeezing over as desired.Do ahead: Agrodolce can be made 4 days ahead. Transfer to an airtight container; cover and chill.
