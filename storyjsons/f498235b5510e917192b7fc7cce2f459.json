Then I got pregnant.By Hannah HowardFebruary 17, 2022FacebookTwitterEmailIllustration by Marine BuffardFacebookTwitterEmailI\u2019ve always loved food. I grew up eating well; my mom is a fantastic cook, and the kitchen felt like the heart of connection, fun, and possibility. But from a young age, that love of food was complicated by darker, more difficult layers. I didn\u2019t know the term \u201cdiet culture\u201d then, but I internalized its notion of valuing thinness above nearly all else from a frighteningly young age. I was the tallest girl in my class and the first to need a bra. I don\u2019t remember anyone explicitly telling me my body was wrong, but I never doubted that as a hard and fast truth.So I turned to dieting to \u201cfix\u201d myself. Diets popped in and out of fashion, and I thought one of them might hold the secret to exorcizing my self-loathing. Instead, I\u2019d find myself in bed with a box of granola bars in the middle of the night because\u2014shocker\u2014I was hungry. Our bodies are pretty brilliant, and we\u2019re biologically wired to do everything we can not to starve. But when I did eventually eat, I felt like a failure. I promised myself to restrict even harder the next day.Rinse and repeat, with boring variations, for many years.For a decade now I\u2019ve been lucky enough to be in recovery from an eating disorder. My struggles with food took all sorts of different forms, from anorexia to binge-eating to the frustratingly vague diagnosis of EDNOS\u2014Eating Disorder Not Otherwise Specified. Recovery has meant slowly untangling my joy around food from far less pleasant feelings of obsession, fear, and shame.Recovery has been a long road, and one I wouldn\u2019t trade for anything. It started with asking for help, which was terrifying. My eating disorder was my deepest, darkest secret, and I spent an enormous amount of energy pretending everything was fine. Hearing people speak out loud the things I could barely admit to myself\u2014the things they did with food in the middle of the night, the sneaking around, the complicated calculations\u2014was fascinating. I thought lightning would strike them from above and they would disappear in a clap. After all, these people were admitting the things I hadn\u2019t shared with my therapist, my best friend, or my mom\u2014the source of my most profound shame\u2014to a room full of strangers. They laughed and they hugged. It was profoundly reassuring. Something rearranged itself inside of me; I was no longer alone with this enormous burden.I was 24 then, and I\u2019m 34 now. Since then I\u2019ve had and left boyfriends, jobs, and apartments. I slowly built my life on a foundation of recovery, which is not to say I haven\u2019t made a million mistakes along the way. But for the most part, things have gotten bigger and better.In 2018 I married the most amazing man, and not too long after, I got pregnant. We were elated, but I also felt sort of shocked. It happened so fast! I had spent my whole life trying not to get pregnant, and here we were upending our lives on purpose. I ordered every single not-totally-silly pregnancy book I could get my hands on, and I couldn\u2019t wait to approach pregnancy with earnest nerdiness. Having a baby was such a colossal life change, and books seemed a way into a huge unknown.I began with classics like What to Expect When You\u2019re Expecting and Ina May\u2019s Guide to Childbirth. I had so much to learn. I was embarrassed that I didn\u2019t know much of anything about, say, the placenta. I found plenty of interesting information\u2014growing a baby in your body is wild stuff\u2014but I also noticed a familiar message and tone I hadn\u2019t encountered since my dieting days.There was an illustration of a mama saying \u201cno thank you\u201d to excessive sugar, and enthusiastic affirmations to eat \u201cwholesome foods.\u201d The message was loud and clear: If you cared about your baby, you would forgo sprouts (that\u2019s on the list! sprouts!), tuna fish, coffee, sunny-side up eggs, hot dogs, turkey sandwiches, organ meat, raw milk cheese, anything not organic, anything processed. These books that were purportedly trying to be helpful offered a lot of advice, a lot of rules, and a lot of judgment. They had plenty to say about what to eat, and when, and what not to eat.I started off trying to do everything right. I took my prenatal vitamins religiously (I read that folic acid helps form the baby\u2019s neural tube) and ate plenty of protein (protein is crucial for baby's growth throughout pregnancy). I went to yoga class (movement decreases the chance of preterm labor), but avoided twisting (twists can cause uterine contractions). I eschewed potentially risky foods, from charcuterie to runny eggs to raw sprouts. Who likes sprouts that much anyway? While the tone of the books had me on high alert, the stakes of growing a baby inside of my body were so much higher than trying to lose weight so that I could finally like myself. (Spoiler alert: It doesn\u2019t work that way. No amount of dieting can transform self-loathing into self-love.)But there were some days I was so nauseous that everything bagels toasted with butter were the only things I could stomach. After a day of multiple bagels, I felt that old small-minded voice creep up, admonishing my choices. Would my child develop some sort of unhealthy bagel dependency? Over a decade of recovery, I had spent a whole lot of time and energy understanding my own rules of food (basically, eat what I like and what my body, stomach, and heart want), and rejecting fear-based, wellness-coached rules like \u201cdon\u2019t eat after 8 p.m.,\u201d or \u201ccarbs are evil.\u201d Most people might be able to take such advice with a healthy grain of salt, but my eating disorder reared up again during pregnancy, clinging to maxims like \u201cno processed foods during pregnancy\u201d until I felt like a miserable failure.Science is real, and it's good to know the significant risks, say, of drinking while pregnant. But I was shocked that a fear-based, diet-heavy mentality (thinness = goodness; food = a moral issue), was at the heart of much of the pregnancy-related literature. Like diet books, they felt wrapped up in the policing of women's bodies, and this incorrect story that we can somehow exert a control over our own lives and bodies that doesn\u2019t quite exist. After all, diets resoundingly don\u2019t work. Ultimately, I decided I had to figure out what was right for my own body and proto-baby and life. Wasn\u2019t that part of being an adult person in the world\u2014and soon, a mom?I chose decaf. I didn\u2019t even try the sweetbreads my husband ordered. Maybe I didn\u2019t eat veggies at each and every meal, but I tried. I thought about the words of the pregnancy books, which I heard in a chirpy but scolding voice, and tried to relegate them to the back of my brain.And then, less than 48 hours after hearing the drum of a heartbeat at our first ultrasound, in the very small hours of the morning at a wedding in the green British countryside, I started to bleed. A whole lot. The cab that was meant to take us home for the night rushed me and my husband to the ER instead. I was disgusted at the blood I dripped on the leather taxi seat and onto the clean white floors of the exam room. I shivered even though it wasn\u2019t close to cold. I couldn\u2019t stop shaking.We lost the pregnancy.I knew pregnancy loss was common, but I wasn\u2019t prepared for my own devastating sadness.I think of the proto-baby we lost every day. I wonder what we would have named her. I wonder if her eyes would have crinkled up in the corners as she began to smile at the world.The doctor, my therapist, and friends have reassured me a million times, but there it is, still: I can't help but wonder if I could have done something, anything different. But even if I had eaten all the sweetbreads and downed serial cans of Red Bull, I wouldn\u2019t be to blame for our loss. It doesn\u2019t work that way. Most early-term pregnancy loss occurs because of chromosomal abnormalities that are totally unrelated to, say, eating organ meats.Policing what we eat sows seeds of deep destruction; it certainly has done for me. It teaches us that when something goes \"wrong,\" from miscarriage to weight gain, it's because we somehow weren\u2019t \u201cgood\u201d enough. It\u2019s a very shiny lie because it comes with the false promise of control. Just like dieting, this goal of doing all the pregnancy foods and behaviors perfectly is not only impossible but destructive. One \"right\" doesn't exist at all. The attempt robs me of the food, the joy, and the wonderful, messy life I have right now.Soon after my miscarriage, we got pregnant again with my amazing, intense now-almost-two-year-old daughter. In November 2021, we had a baby boy who has just started smiling and cooing, even when his sister sticks her fingers in his face. Today I had leftovers of the gorgeous veggie-packed soup I made for dinner, and I ate some stale Twizzlers out of my laptop bag. Both were delicious. They gave my body energy to chase my toddler through the playground as she screamed \u201cyeah, yeah, yeah,\u201d and to make breastmilk to feed my seemingly always hungry baby.Their futures are full of bowls of soup, Twizzlers, and I hope more adventures and deliciousness than I can even begin to imagine for them. I pray they won\u2019t worry when they eat more than one bagel and that they will regard their appetites with a love, joy, and awe that feels blessedly simple.Explore Bon App\u00e9titCultureessayRecipes you want to make.
