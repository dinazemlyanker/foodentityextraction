But also, it\u2019s probably healthier, tastier, and cheaper than your to-go default.

The 1 tbsp honey in the sauce totally overpowered the entire mixture and the lemon juice in the beans wasn't enough to tart out the sweetness. I would make it again but with a different BA green goddess sauce instead of the sesame one. CarolinepartyrockIndiana6/1/2020Let me say first that I am not a vegetarian but I love vegetables. I made this sandwich, tossing in small chunks of avocado into the bean mixture. What a beautiful sandwich! The next morning, I made a \"breakfast\" sandwich adding cooked egg white and thinly sliced tomato to the sandwich. Wow!
