Can alcohol go bad? What types of alcohol do you need to refrigerate? What\u2019s the shelf life of that bottle of vermouth? We\u2019re here to answer your questions and assuage your fears of alcohol spoilage with some professional advice.We chatted with Meaghan Montagano, beverage manager at NYC\u2019s Nat\u2019s on Bank, and John deBary, author of Drink What You Want, to find out how to store liquor, what alcohol you need to refrigerate\u2014and ways to use it up more quickly. (Hint: It involves more drinking. A hardship.)Making a Manhattan? Listen up!\nPeden & MunkWhat types of alcohol do you not need to refrigerate?DeBary puts his alcohol into two categories: If it\u2019s processed through timed fermentation\u2014think vermouth, sherry, or other wine-based booze\u2014an open bottle will likely benefit from being stored in the fridge (more on this below!). But if it\u2019s distilled (think gin, vodka, and other base spirits that you would consider \u201chard liquor\u201d), it\u2019s already gone through a process that relies on big temperature fluctuations and likely okay stored at room temperature. These spirits have a super high alcohol content that will protect them from oxidation or from developing any funky flavors (especially if they\u2019re unopened).But this is not permission to store them year-round on top of your radiator or on your windowsill in the sunlight. As a general rule of thumb, you\u2019ll want to store your bottles of liquor\u2014even the ones with the highest alcohol content\u2014in a cool, dark place, like a designated liquor cabinet away from direct sunlight or drastic temperature fluctuations. You don\u2019t need to go so far as to store base spirits in your freezer\u2014but it\u2019s a great option if you prefer to serve them chilled (and are running out of room on your bar cart).What types of alcohol do you need to refrigerate?If you\u2019ve ever left a bottle of re-corked wine on the counter for over a week, you know the despair of musty-smelling, funky-tasting booze. While you likely won\u2019t get sick from taking a few sips of an open bottle of wine that\u2019s been on the counter for a week, it definitely won\u2019t taste its best.\u201cIt\u2019s not undrinkable, or like you\u2019ve committed some huge crime against the gods of beverages,\u201d deBary says. \u201cIt\u2019s more about the level of freshness you want to work with.\u201d If you\u2019re investing in a top-shelf vermouth, for example, you want to make it last for as many cocktails as you can.So how do you know what deserves your precious fridge space? If you\u2019re having trouble discerning between liquor that\u2019s been distilled versus booze that\u2019s been processed through timed fermentation, Montagano suggests a helpful blanket rule: If your booze is wine-based, or has under 15% alcohol, it\u2019s worth keeping in the fridge. Here are some more specific guidelines for the common types of alcohol you may have on hand for sipping or spiking.VermouthThere should be an extra step when making a Manhattan: Once you\u2019re done mixing up your drink, put the vermouth in the fridge. Oxygen hits the liquid immediately after the bottle is opened. Whether it\u2019s dry vermouth (maybe you\u2019re making a Fifty-Fifty Martini), sweet red vermouth (for negronis), or the in-between bianco (for a new twist on a negroni), it needs to go in the fridge\u2014where it won\u2019t last longer than a few months. (Montagano notes that the sweeter reds will last a little longer, but not much.)A great negroni deserves fresh vermouth.\nPhoto by Chelsie Craig\u201cIf you go to a dive bar and there\u2019s Martini & Rossi on the bar, you know your negroni will be trash,\u201d she adds. To know whether something has gone bad, be sure to taste a sip when you first open the bottle. It should be bright and complex. As it oxidizes, it will be flat and dull, and when it\u2019s really bad, it could smell like a wet dog. This rule applies to any wine-based product.Sherry and PortOnce you open a bottle of Sherry or port, keep it cold. While they are fortified to a slightly higher alcohol content than vermouth, they\u2019re still volatile and spoil more quickly than you might think. Some bottles\u2014like Pedro Ximenez, a hearty, sweet dessert sherry\u2014could go for a couple of months, while other, more delicate varieties, like Fino, could spoil after a week. Montagano\u2019s suggestion? Shop in small bottles\u2014like 375 ml\u2014so that you won\u2019t let any go to waste.Use up extra sherry with this tonic.\nChristopher TestaniMarsala and MadeiraIf you have a little Marsala or Madeira wine as an after-dinner drink, tuck it away in the fridge afterward. But If you\u2019re planning on cooking with it (as in, you don\u2019t require peak freshness for, say, chicken Marsala), you have a little wiggle room to let it sit for a month or two in the fridge. \u201cThe alcohol component is broken down and reduced, so as long as it isn't completely oxidized, cooking with it is probably fine,\u201d Montagano explains. The flavor just won\u2019t be as bright. (The same rule applies to that bottle of white wine sitting in the fridge for a few weeks\u2014use it for clam sauce if it hasn\u2019t turned!)Aperitifs Like Lillet, Cocchi Americano, and CampariBecause many aperitifs are wine-based or have more delicate herbal flavors, they all benefit from having a home in the fridge. French Lillet is a smoother floral, citrusy aperitif that you can drink on its own or in a Bond-approved Vesper martini. Lillet Rouge (red) will last the longest\u2014up to a month refrigerated\u2014while the Blanc and Ros\u00e9 styles will only go for a few weeks in the fridge.\u00a0Italian Cocchi Americano is Moscato-based aperitif wine that pairs well with club soda and orange. (Cocchi Rosa, the red-wine-based aperitif, will last longer than the white varietal.) And to preserve the flavor of fruity, botanical Campari, tuck it in the fridge if you don\u2019t finish that open bottle within a couple of days.Cream LiqueurIt\u2019s actually not necessary to keep this refrigerated, says deBary, because of the ways it\u2019s processed and its alcohol content of 20%. \u201cGiven the combination of alcohol and sugar content, it\u2019s pretty stable and it\u2019s probably not going to oxidize.\u201dNow that your fridge is full of aperitifs and fortified wines, don\u2019t use them only for cocktails\u2014try a glass on the rocks with a twist of citrus. Low-ABV drinks are ideal for day-drinking, and if you\u2019d rather go big, punches or sangria are good places to use your alcohol when it\u2019s just starting to turn. Oh, look, here\u2019s an idea for all that sweet vermouth:Apple Cider and Rum PunchThink of this as a house punch that's a snap to make and relatively low in alcohol. Hard ciders can range from bone-dry to rather sweet, so take a sip and adjust the simple syrup if needed.View RecipeEditor\u2019s note: This story has been updated by Antara Sinha since it was originally published in April 2017.Explore Bon App\u00e9titAlcohol & Other DrinksLiquorRead MorecultureThe 4 Types of Gin and What They Even AreBy Alex BeggscultureSo, What Exactly Is Natural Wine?By Belle Cushing and Marissa A.
