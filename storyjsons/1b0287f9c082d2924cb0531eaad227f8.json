Chef Nico Schuermans weaves together Belgian, North African, Persian, and Mediterranean influences, and the result is consistently excellent food. Unrelenting attention to detail is Chambar\u2019s hallmark, applied both to the restaurant\u2019s food and its atmosphere.ORDER THE: mussels Congolaise with frites (a side of sourdough for broth-dipping is essential), the tajine d\u2019aziz \u00e0 l\u2019agneau (lamb shank tagine), and the fl\u00e9tan et noix de cajoux (halibut with cashews and pomegranate molasses). The morning options are imaginative and skillfully executed\u2014think the gaufre au saumon with yuzu-dill hollandaise and bol sant\u00e9 with savory granola and a marinated egg. Not everyone has caught on to the fact they now do brunch, so seize the moment.THE VIBE IS: slightly racy and rebellious. It\u2019s fine dining that doesn\u2019t take itself too seriously, set to \u201960s soul and served by a team that always seems like they\u2019re all in on some wicked secret. They\u2019ve been doing things their own way since 2004. Schuermans and his business partner and wife, Karri, have managed to make each section feel intimate despite the large space, with a gilded interior of wood, brick, tile, and a constellation of sculptural lighting.PRACTICAL STUFF: Open every day,  from 8 a.m. to late (a.k.a. whenever the Schuermans\u2019 party is over). Reservations accepted online or by phone.\u2014Lindsay AndersonJenna LowWE ALSO LOVEUpstairs at Campagnolo\u201cCamp Upstairs\u201d in Strathcona is the only carpeted dive bar you\u2019ll want to spend time inCaf\u00e9 MedinaThe city\u2019s downtown brunch institutionSt. LawrenceTake a \u201ctrip\u201d to Quebec via Vancouver\u2019s Downtown EastsideExplore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
