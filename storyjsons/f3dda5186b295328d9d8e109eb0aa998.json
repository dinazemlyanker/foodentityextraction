Now she has the recipe, and she's ready to evangelize.By Carla Lalli MusicOctober 16, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Alex LauFacebookTwitterEmailSeveral months ago, I ate a bowl of magic beans, and my life has been forever improved.I was having dinner with my family at Brooklyn\u2019s Marlow & Sons restaurant, not long after my younger son, the picky one, had decided for no reason that he was now a vegetarian. \u201cYou know,\u201d I told him, \u201cI totally support this impulsive decision, but if you\u2019re going to eliminate animal protein, you\u2019re going to have to open up to other protein sources, so we\u2019re ordering the beans.\u201dShortly thereafter, the beans were delivered to the table: big creamy white butter beans in a shallow wide bowl, with enough broth to merit eating them with a spoon but not so much liquid that they felt like soup. There were rusty-colored breadcrumbs scattered about, and a dollop of aioli tucked over to one side. I took one look and immediately asked our server to add a second bowl of beans to our order.Picky vegetarian dipped his spoon into the broth, licked it, nodded approvingly. He ate one bean. I tried not to pay much attention, but I was analyzing every click of his jaw. He uttered an approving \u201cHmmm!\u201d\u201cYou like those?\u201d I asked, super nonchalant.\u201cPretty good,\u201d he replied.\u201cOh, that\u2019s cool. Well, enjoy\u2014we got a second order, so those are all yours.\u201dThen he ate the entire bowl, which I tried not to notice but actually I was elbowing my husband in the arm and kicking my other child under the table and trying not to fall off my stool the entire time he was eating. The second order of beans arrived, and then I had a legume experience that most vegetarians only dream about. Supreme bean cookery: Silky insides; intact skins. Sweet, earthy flavor. Plenty of salt. Rich, long-cooked aromas in the broth, and little bits of crunchy crumbs to break up the texture. When stirred, the garlicky aioli dispersed into the broth and slid over the beans, like a last, fine layer of comfort over the whole bowl. It was honestly pretty annoying that the kid got a whole bowl to himself and the rest of us had to split it three ways.The next day, I emailed Marlow\u2019s chef, Patch Troffer, and begged for the recipe. I\u2019ve made a lot of beans in my life, I told him, but these beans\u2026 there weren\u2019t words. What were his secrets? How did he get them that texture? What the f*ck was in that broth?Luckily for all of us, Patch wrote back, and now, with practice and allegiance to his instructions, we can all make The Beans. Step one, of course, is to buy a good bean. Patch uses a butter bean from Iacopi Farms in Half Moon Bay, California, that you can only get at specific farmers markets in Northern California, which crushed me to learn. If you\u2019re an ordinary human, buy the best butter bean, corona, or baby lima you can find (I like Rancho Gordo and Z\u00fcrsun, which you can order online, or buy dried beans at your local farmers market.) If you do everything else Patch says, you\u2019re going to make a great pot of beans.Here\u2019s his email, with a few comments from me along the way. My advice: Do what the man says. The next time you\u2019re in Brooklyn, head over to Marlow & Sons and bask in the ideal bean (get the oysters, too).Hi Carla,Hope this note finds you well.I\u2019m glad to hear you enjoyed the beans and were curious about what's in them. They're truly quite simple, and I have to give most of their credit to a perfect dried bean. I've been buying from Iacopi Farms in Half Moon Bay, CA for a long time now; Chez Panisse bought from them a lot, and their alum in turn continued to use their beans. I was thusly introduced to them. We've got a guy who ships the butterbeans to us weekly. I am unaware of anywhere here that sells them. They're truly perfect beans and worth the hunt.I do a normal soak, just water, overnight in the walk-in. I bring to a boil, skim the scum, and I add salt. I like to add salt throughout the cooking process. I don't wait. Then lower to a simmer.Carla\u2019s Note: At home, put the beans in a big bowl, cover them with water and refrigerate them overnight, then transfer them to a big pot for cooking.I confit a bunch of garlic and throw it all in with the confit oil. I like to have an inch or so fat cap on the top to keep the beans submerged. I'll add more salt here.Carla\u2019s Note: Don\u2019t gloss over that part. \u201cAn inch or so\u201d of fat should be sitting on the surface of your bean liquid. If you don\u2019t have confit garlic, add whole peeled garlic cloves and lots of good olive oil. I keep random rendered fats in jars in my fridge, because I\u2019m weird like that, and believe you could use schmaltz or ham fat if you wanted to make these not vegetarian.I sometimes add an overripe tomato in the summer. I like savory with beans; I like mint with beans; oregano too. Salt. If I add herbs I do it repeatedly, so there are long-cooked herbs and freshly dropped herbs at the end. Salt.Carla\u2019s Note: The salt seems important, dig?I like burnt lemon halves, salt.Carla\u2019s Note: No, I don\u2019t generally have burned lemon halves on hand, either. If you want to emulate this, heat up a dry small skillet over medium-high heat, and cook two lemon halves, cut side down, until the surface is charred, 3\u20134 minutes, then add to the pot.Sometimes I'll add a spice. The recent week you had them, I believe I was using coriander seed (along with mostly oregano, some mint; burnt lemons). Salt!Carla\u2019s Note: He is not playing around with the salt, people.I cook the beans not even at a simmer and stir obsessively, gently. They'll be under-cooked and under-flavored for what seems like forever, until they're suddenly perfect.Add more herb here, and final round of salt. A good glug of good vinegar too. I've been using sherry.To serve, I am a firm believer of garlicky lemony loose aioli to stir in, and breadcrumbs too. Or at the very least some really great olive oil.I'm not sure any of these are necessarily secrets, or none that you likely already know\u2014I really think the magic is in the bean. But I hope that this was still somehow helpful?Carla\u2019s Note: The Magic is in the Bean would be a great title for Patch\u2019s memoir, don\u2019t you think?Feel free to ask any further questions you may have!Best,PatchExplore Bon App\u00e9titWhite BeanVegetarianRecipes you want to make.
