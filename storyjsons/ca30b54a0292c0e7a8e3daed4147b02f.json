This time around: how to wash the dishes.I\u2019ve used a lot of random crap to clean up kitchen spills: A handkerchief, a bandana, an old t-shirt, and, most regretfully, a bath towel that had been wrapped around my sopping wet person just 20 seconds before an egg yolk busted all over my floor. All because the couple of dish towels I did own were always lurking in the wash when I needed them most. I now know that\u2019s because two towels is about 1200% less than the recommended stockpile.So how many dish towels do you need? Well, it's \"impossible to own too many,\u201d according to Adam Rapoport. \u201cMinimum, two dozen,\u201d Sohla El-Waylly confirms. Rachel Karten thought her boyfriend was losing his marbles when he ordered 16 for their kitchen. \u201cBut now I am VERY thankful for each and every one of them,\u201d she says. For Alex Beggs, dish towels are a saving grace in her relationship. \u201cMy boyfriend is a messy cook; like a slovenly Midas, everything he touches turns to an oil stain,\u201d she says. Her solution? \u201cApproximately 17 towels.\u201d Then, just like that, Carla Lalli Music totally upped the stakes: \u201cI have a thousand.\u201dWhy so many? Well, you want to have enough that there can be a few in the wash at any time\u2014using a dirty towel to clean is unadvised. Some towels should be kept clean and dry and used only as oven mitts, others can be poised to sop up messy spills, the thinnest ones are best for polishing your delicates (uh, nice glassware), and thicker ones should be relegated to  heavy-duty dish-drying. I don\u2019t know about you, but I\u2019ve lost count.So, when it comes to stocking up on new dish towels, you\u2019re really looking at three specific types: thick, thin, and fancy-ish.Sturdy, thick towels, whether they\u2019re waffle- or flat-weave, are, in the words of Test Kitchen Manager Gaby Melian \u201cthe horsepower towels.\u201d They\u2019re good for taking a lasagna or tray of cookies out of the oven, wiping up big spills, and getting through a dinner\u2019s worth of dish-drying.Thinner dish towels\u2014like your classic Herringbone weave\u2014can be folded to suit most tasks: heat-proofing handles, drying fragile items and cutlery, and wiping up light spills. You can also lay them down on a counter or table when you\u2019ve made an elaborate fried chicken feast and need to temporarily extend the capacity of your dish rack. These guys will soak through faster, though, so make sure you \u201clet them air dry before throwing them in the laundry,\u201d says Melian.It should go without saying that your special towels\u2014for Beggs that\u2019s a corny dish cloth from H-E-B that\u2019s covered in Texan landmarks, for Lalli Music that\u2019s \u201csome nice linen ones\u201d\u2014should be reserved for drying clean dishes (or lining fruit bowls to impress your guests). An oily slick of marinade is a hard thing to come back from.No matter the category, when it comes to absorbency and durability, you should be opting for lint-free, 100% cotton dish towels. \u201cThey get better with age!\u201d says Melian.So, yes, you probably don\u2019t have enough dish towels. But in the name of not playing favorites, let\u2019s just say that, thick or thin or fancy-ish, they\u2019re all good. And, take it from me, they\u2019re all a whole lot better than your favorite t-shirt .Just Buy It: Royal Classic White Kitchen Towels, 30-Pack, $29 on AmazonJust Buy It: Williams Sonoma Classic Logo Towels, 4-pack, $20 Williams SonomaLet's be real.
