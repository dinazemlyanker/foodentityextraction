It\u2019s so good!\u201dMe: \u201cI totally had some, thanks!\u201d [I\u2019d rather starve than be seen taking another bite.]Hello, hi. I'm the plus-size woman you know who would love nothing more than to join in on the party\u2014the birthdays, the pizza Fridays, the team breakfast\u2014but the cultural and social stigmas that surround  having a fat body and enjoying food prevent me from ever fully taking part in the occasion.I\u2019ve been hyper-aware of my consumption of and proximity to food ever since I turned 12, hit puberty, grew hips, and was suddenly struck with just how gross my XL body was to the people around me. Because of this, I often choose salads in public. I only take halves of anything. I never talk about how hungry I feel. I will never admit I\u2019m too full. I don\u2019t comment on anyone\u2019s food, and I never go for a whole piece of cake, ever ever ever. I recently ate a cookie from the inside pocket of my coat while leaving Grand Central and thought to myself, \u201cI\u2019m going to Fat Hell for this public display of consumption.\u201dAll this is crazy because I\u2019ve spent years living as a body-positive activist: I\u2019ve modeled, I\u2019ve challenged the wellness community to include my size 18 body in their advertisements, I\u2019ve talked about the privilege of enjoying food when you\u2019re thin, and I\u2019ve spoken openly and frequently about having been a teen-to-early twenties bulimic. My Instagram is basically an ode to how good I look in lingerie, and I genuinely love my body. I love how it slopes into an S shape when stand, I love laying on my side with an exterior arm crossing the curve of my hip, and I love how simultaneously muscular and soft it is. Where is all this love when birthday doughnuts show up at the office and I can\u2019t bear to be seen taking one?In 2016, Ira Glass interviewed author Lindy West on This American Life about the way people talk about fat. The episode explained something I\u2019d always felt but never thought about explicitly: that there are good fat people and bad fat people. Glass summarizes West\u2019s point: \u201cAs long as you're a fat person trying not to be fat, that's acceptable. That's a good fat person.\u201d Yeah. That\u2019s it. The controlled eating, the worry about others seeing me\u2014it\u2019s all about trying to be the good kind of fat.I\u2019m floored by body-positive Instagram posts that would have me believe that one day I\u2019ll wake up and my food shame will be washed away, that I\u2019ll be a confident person without being plagued by negative food thoughts. That\u2019s just not going to happen for me or for a lot of other people. So I\u2019ve been trying to remind myself that loving my body and working through these food issues are not mutually exclusive. I try to remind myself that, as a body-image activist, I should be open about these contradictions. My brand of body-positivity and activism is about recognizing internalized shame and fear and letting others in on the experience. Because if others know what I\u2019m dealing with, maybe they will feel less alone in their experience.So here are a few ways I try to combat food stigmas and my own internalized guilt:I don\u2019t assume that everyone around me is okay talking about food. Saying things like, \u201cI\u2019m going to get a healthy salad today\u201d feels innocuous but places value on certain food choices when everyone\u2019s choices are different.I don\u2019t use the phrase \u201cI feel fat\u201d because I don\u2019t like my physical body being used to describe a temporary negative state. Do I feel full? Do I feel sad? Cool. Fat isn\u2019t a feeling.I embrace intuitive eating, which involves eating when hungry but also eating foods that make me feel nourished without judging those choices.I am an ally for all bodies, not just the ones in my community. Telling a person they are too thin, look sickly, or should eat something because of their small size contributes to internalized food and body shame.I take a ton of photos of my body and try to be naked as much as possible. I spent so many years at war with my body that I had to re-expose my brain to what I look like, how I move, and how I feel. Nakedness has become so routine that I don\u2019t fear my body anymore.I make myself solo meals and enjoy them: panko chicken wings, carbonara and pancetta, brown butter and sage ravioli. I have found that showing myself that I deserve good food has made it easier for me to enjoy it when I\u2019m in public.It took me a long time to let go of my eating disorder and an even longer time to be at peace with my body. I\u2019m still working toward being the role model I needed back then: a plus-size woman who\u2019s focused on her own happiness, a woman who will take the last cupcake, or leave it, because she wants to and not because anyone else thinks she should.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishSelf CareessayRead MorecultureNicole Byer Is #VeryFatVeryBrave, Thank You Very MuchBy Alyse WhitneyRecipes you want to make.
