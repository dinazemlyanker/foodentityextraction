(Underwear, that too!) But how to store onions? Don\u2019t you just, er, put them on the counter and let them hang out for\u2026I don't know\u2026ever? That\u2019s what I thought until one dark morning several years ago, when I walked into the kitchen and found the counter covered in stinky liquid. The potatoes and onions, which had been bunking together in the same basket, had led to each other\u2019s demise: The spuds had sprouted and softened; the onions had liquified and leaked. \u00a0I am telling you this horror story not to gross you out, but to implore you to consider how to store onions (and potatoes). Here\u2019s what you need to know to extend your onions\u2019 lifespans for as long as possible:Keep storage onions in a cool, dark, and dry place.Moisture and light lead to mold (ew) and sprouting (annoying, though not a deal-breaker), so stow your storage onions (red, yellow, and white as well as shallots and the diminutive pearl and cippoline) in a dry, well-ventilated basket, bin, or large bowl. Keep them out of the sun and in a cool but not freezing locale with some air circulation. I keep mine in the cabinet with all of my baking dishes, but in the future I aspire to buy crates\u2019 worth and stow them in a garage or cellar.\u00a0You also want to make sure, as you have gleaned from my anecdote, that they\u2019re separated from potatoes (which are prone to rotting if kept nearby).\u00a0How long do onions last?According to The Chef\u2019s Garden cookbook, onions stored at temperatures between 30\u00b0F and 50\u00b0F will keep for up to one year. Otherwise, they\u2019ll last for several weeks.Store cut onions in the refrigerator (or even the freezer)\u2026You can hang on to a halved or sliced onion in an airtight container in the fridge for about one week. Store them in an airtight container (preferably a glass one, as plastic will absorb odor) to decrease oxidation, moisture absorption, and stinkiness. And as long as you\u2019re going to be cooking the onions, rather than using them raw as a topping or condiment, where texture is vital, you can store them in the freezer for several months.\u00a0\u2026along with any tender, fresh alliums.For alliums that aren\u2019t long for this world (as in, they haven\u2019t been cured for long-term storage)\u2014think scallions, spring onions, sweet onions, leeks, green garlic, garlic scapes, chives\u2014store them in the fridge. Anything that comes bunched\u2014like spring onions and scallions\u2014unfurl, then wrap in a damp paper towel and tuck them into a bag or airtight container. (I also peel away anything that\u2019s slimy or wilting and toss it into the compost\u2014it\u2019s not going to help the cause.)Explore Bon App\u00e9titOnionStoringRecipes you want to make.
