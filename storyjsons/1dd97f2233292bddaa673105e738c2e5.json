They can be saucy or sticky. Asian flavors like rice wine, soy sauce, and gochujang, a fermented red chili paste, are important because without them, your stir-fry would resemble something more like a casserole. And casseroles are like the anti-stir-fry.The single most important element to a great stir-fry, however, is sizzle, so choose your cookware wisely. We like All-Clad D3 Compact pans and D5 collection for their fast, even heating, and exceptional searing. And heat is everything to a stir-fry\u2014that\u2019s how you get the good crispy bits, which, let\u2019s be honest, are one of the best parts. See above shot for cookware inspiration.Summer may be coming to a close, but there\u2019s still plenty of time to snag fresh loot from the farmer\u2019s market and toss up a stir-fry combo that keeps the heat in your kitchen a little bit longer.AW, SNAP!Fresh, in-season snap peas are the popcorn of the vegetable world: crunchy, easy to eat, and delicious any time of the day. A flavorful asparagus is nothing to overlook, either. In this steak, snap pea, and asparagus stir-fry, crunchy veg is king, but when mixed with shallots and ginger, it\u2019s easy to see that summer is alive and well. Try whipping this one up in the All-Clad D3 Compact skillet , which is great for grilling meats.A TALE OF TWO TOFUSNo matter how long you close your eyes and dream of sunbathing on the idyllic beaches of Thailand, you just won\u2019t be transported there (we\u2019ve tried). But with a few easy-to-find ingredients, you can whip up this spicy Thai tofu stir-fry. Peanuts, onion, and red bell pepper give the fry its necessary crunch, while basil, spinach, lime juice, and soy sauce add major flavor and additional texture. The best part is that the actual cook time is under 10 minutes and you can wow your dinner guests by flipping the dish around a few times.If spice isn\u2019t your thing, but vegetarianism is (though meat lover\u2019s will dig this one, too), we suggest this tofu and mushroom stir-fry that pits crispy, flavor-soaked tofu and scallions against mushrooms and ginger, all bathed in a mixture of soy sauce, rice vinegar, and rice wine. Mm-hmm, that\u2019s right.WHERE\u2019VE YOU BEAN ALL MY LIFE?This is not your momma\u2019s string bean recipe (though we\u2019re sure your mom is lovely). A simple yet extraordinary combo, this chicken green bean stir-fry gets its kicks from Chinese-fermented rice wine, and is made bright and crunchy with market-fresh green beans. A little cornstarch thickens up the sauce while a sprinkling of chopped-up cashews, sesame seeds, or peanuts delivers a ferociously textured finishing touch. Because stir-fries like this one are a bit like a one-pot meal, it\u2019d be ideal to cook it in something like the All-Clad D5 3-Qt Saute Pan, which combines a wide base for searing and saut\u00e9ing over higher heat with sloped, rounded sides to contain liquids while you're thickening up your sauce.ALL VEGGIE, ALL THE TIMEColor is key in this summer vegetable stir-fry. It\u2019s optimal for emptying the fridge of your latest CSA farm share, with major summer players like zucchini, squash, carrots, and radishes leading the charge. A mixture of herbs is essential, too. Go all in on mint, cilantro, tarragon, or celery leaves, or just pick your favorite two and run with it.GOING GREENNot all heroes wear capes, and not all stir-fries require rice. Whether you\u2019ve exhausted all your ideas for a summer salad or you\u2019re just in the mood for a heartier form of vitamin K, this Stir Fried Greens with Bacon recipe is exactly what you\u2019ve been waiting for. Use a pan like the All-Clad D3 Compact 10 inch skillet.  New contoured handles fit perfectly in hand and are securely riveted to the pan, while flared edges allow for accurate, drip-free pouring , which has a riveted matrix on the interior for natural stick resistance, and is ideal for cooking on high heat with oils for full, rich flavors (eh-hrm, that\u2019s the definition of a great stir fry). The trick is in the timing\u2014let each handful wilt before packing in another. Then bring it home with a secret sauce, scallions, and, of course, bacon.Recipes you want to make.
