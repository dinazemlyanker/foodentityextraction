He shares recipes he's been cooking, restaurants he's been eating at, and more. It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.I had a whole other newsletter written and ready to go yesterday, but then I heard the Kobe Bryant news. I was poking around a bakery with my wife and son, and I got a text from Simone\u2019s cousin, Tony.\u201cKobe\u2026Can\u2019t be trueF*#%F*#%\u201dI googled what I feared and found the initial reports, prior to ESPN or The New York Times confirming the story. I then told my 12-year-old son the news. Even though Marlon\u2019s not much of an NBA fan, he knew all about Kobe\u2014of course he did. But he couldn\u2019t wrap his head around the accident. He kept asking questions about what exactly happened. As if he was trying to find a way to poke holes in the story to make it un-happen.Later in the afternoon, when we learned that Kobe\u2019s 13-year-old daughter Gianna was on the helicopter with him, things only got sadder. But when it was time for dinner, we were still going to cook. And we would sit down at the table, my wife, son, and I, and we would talk about what had happened.Want this letter before it hits the website?

But food is always what brings us together, especially in times like this.When my father passed away in 2012, my brother, sister, mom, and I met at the train station in Hudson, NY, and we immediately found our way to the corner bar for lunch. We weren\u2019t about to sit in a room and talk about our father\u2019s passing without a meal in front of us. We\u2019re Rapoports\u2014it\u2019s what we do. And I imagine any number of families would have done the same thing.So last night, as I stood in our kitchen, I tried to process the death of an athlete who I struggled with as a fan\u2014he was a relentlessly driven and talented player, but also often a selfish one who irked some basketball purists. (And, of course, there was an off-the-court issue that tainted his career.) But I rarely considered him as the proud, committed father of four girls, who was boldly exploring a post-NBA life with the same fearless drive he applied in his playing days. As I worked through all this in my head, I methodically got to cooking. Nothing fancy, but food that would comfort us on a bleak Sunday night. I made Andy Baraghani\u2019s ginger-scallion ramen noodles and some maple-roasted carrots.Maybe I over-salted the ramen. Maybe I need to reconsider Kobe, the person and the athlete. Sometimes you don\u2019t know you care until you do.Explore Bon App\u00e9titAdam NewsletterRead MorecookingTofu That\u2019s Crispy and Glazed All at the Same TimeBy Adam RapoportcultureIt\u2019s Not Easy Being Green\u2014But We\u2019re TryingBy Adam RapoportRecipes you want to make.
