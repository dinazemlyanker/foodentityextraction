See our past recommendations here!I\u2019ve never been big on beauty products. I use cheap drugstore face wash and have a drawerful of unopened antiaging serums my mom impulse-bought me while waiting in TJ Maxx checkout lines over the years. Nor did I fancy myself an especially brand loyal sort\u2014until recently, when it dawned on me that, actually, I\u2019ve been unabashedly endorsing one beauty product for a solid decade: the Dorco Tinkle Eyebrow Razor affectionately known (to me) as the lady face-scaper.This pen-size face razor for women is travel-friendly and inexpensive (six pastel-hued sticks set you back $5, and each one stays sharp for about a half dozen uses). The Tinkle\u2019s delicately notched edges work wonders on shaping eyebrows\u2014less painfully and more accurately than plucking away with tweezers\u2014and on fine hair like cheek fuzz. (I promise said fuzz won\u2019t grow back coarser or nefariously multiply.) No shame to anyone's hair game(!), but over the years I\u2019ve gifted Tinkles to countless women wanting to sculpt their brows or hedge trim upper lips, chins, and sideburns. It\u2019s my version of taking a friendship \u201cto the next level\u201d; nothing fast-tracks intimacy like swapping tips on how to landscape rogue facial hair.Speaking of bonding, whenever someone in my life \u201cgets\u201d bangs (my own journey began at age four when Mom performed a fateful bowl cut), I like to slide a Tinkle across the table over cocktails. Like the pied piper of hair-scaping, I smugly empower the newly fringed to embrace self-trims. Be warned that trimming bangs dulls the Tinkle much faster than facial shaving (you might only get two uses out of each razor), but I\u2019ve found it an excellent way to get fringe out of my eyes or snip face-framing layers between haircuts\u2014without looking like I\u2019ve hacked them crudely with kitchen shears after a glass and a half of Pinot.Lately, I\u2019ve been Tinkling my whole face and neck for inexpensive, gentle exfoliation\u2014husking dead skin off for what I\u2019ve found to be a smoother complexion. (Known in wellness jargon as dermaplaning\u2014face-shaving for exfoliation has swelled into its own lucrative market, full of high-end tools sporting advanced claims.) Still, any old single-edge razor will get closer to the skin than a multiblade one, removing dead surface skin cells while it shears fine hair.The act is almost therapeutic and easily as gratifying as peeling off a blackhead strip. However, I can\u2019t say this face razor for women has done much for my hormonal mid-30s acne, which is now melding wonderfully with the slow creep of age lines. I suppose there are no silver bullets in beauty, are there? Still, nothing beats a good Tinkle.Dorco Tinkle Eyebrow Razor$5 at Amazon (6 razors)$5 at Tinkle USA (6 razors)Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishHealthyish Loves ItShoppingRecipes you want to make.
