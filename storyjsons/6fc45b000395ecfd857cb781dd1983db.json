Cake maker extraordinaire Bronwen Wyatt of New Orleans \u201ctiny-bakery\u201d Bayou Saint Cake says you can swap the hazelnuts for walnuts or pecans and the rye flour for whole grain flour, and add or subtract any spice you like. Just make sure you\u2019re using tart baking apples (such as Granny Smith) or the flavor might get lost. Lastly, you really want to bake this cake until it\u2019s a deep, burnished copper color. If you\u2019re short on time, you can omit the buttercream and serve the cake warm with ice cream or cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Lightly coat a 9\"-diameter cake (sides should be at least 2\") or springform pan with nonstick spray. Line bottom of pan with a parchment paper round; lightly coat with nonstick spray. Toast hazelnuts on a rimmed baking sheet, tossing once, until golden brown, 8\u201310 minutes. Let cool.Step 2Meanwhile, whisk all-purpose flour and rye flour in a small bowl to combine.Step 3Pulse hazelnuts, sugar, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, coriander, and nutmeg in a food processor until mixture looks sandy. Add eggs, dates, and oil and process to a thick paste (mixture will resemble freshly ground nut butter). Transfer to a large bowl and add flour mixture. Using a rubber spatula or wood spoon, mix until almost no dry streaks remain. Add apples and, using wet hands, mix apples into batter (apples will be barely surrounded by batter). Scrape batter into pan; press down firmly and evenly into pan with wet hands (batter will be very thick and sticky).Step 4Bake cake, rotating halfway through, until very deep golden brown and a tester inserted into the center comes out with only a few moist crumbs attached, 70\u201380 minutes. Transfer pan to a wire rack and let cake cool in pan. (This cake is very fragile when warm, so it\u2019s important to let it cool completely in the pan before attempting to turn it out.)Step 5Hold a plate upside down over pan and invert to turn out cake; peel away parchment paper. Chill cake 30 minutes (this will make it easier to frost).buttercream and assemblyStep 6While the cake is chilling, whisk egg whites, sugar, salt, and cream of tartar (if using; it helps stabilize the egg whites, giving you lofty peaks) in the bowl of a stand mixer just to combine. Set over a medium saucepan filled with 1\" of gently simmering water (the bottom of the bowl should not be touching the water). Heat, whisking constantly, until sugar is dissolved and an instant-read thermometer registers 185\u00b0, 8\u201310 minutes.Step 7Fit bowl onto stand mixer fitted with whisk attachment and beat on medium-high speed until meringue is stiff and glossy and bowl feels barely warm to the touch, about 5 minutes. With the motor running, add butter a piece at a time, incorporating fully before adding the next piece, 8\u201310 minutes. If mixture starts to look chunky or liquidy, just keep beating; it will come back together. Add lemon juice and vanilla extract; beat on high speed until buttercream looks glossy and smooth.Step 8To frost the cake, make sure bottom of cake is facing up (this will provide a flat surface for easy frosting). Scoop buttercream on top of cake and spread a thick layer over the surface with a small offset spatula or butter knife. Spread a thin film of buttercream over sides. Decorate top with edible flowers and/or toasted hazelnuts as desired.Do ahead: Cake can be baked 2 days ahead; tightly wrap and chill, or freeze up to 2 weeks. If frozen, thaw in fridge before frosting. Frosting can be made 5 days ahead; cover and chill. Bring to room temperature, then beat in stand mixer before using. Cake (without decorations) can be assembled 3 days ahead; cover and chill. Bring to room temperature before serving.How would you rate Apple-Hazelnut Rye Cake?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (12)Back to TopTriangleI only made the cake (not the frosting) and thought it was pretty tasty, but not necessarily special. I couldn't taste the hazelnuts or rye at all, so not sure why they're necessary or in the name - I usually have rye on hand but others may not, and hazelnuts are expensive.  The texture of the batter seemed super weird and it was a little hard to combine with the apples, but the texture of the baked cake was moist and relatively light. The dates contributed a lot of caramel-y flavor. It's a little on the sweet side - I'd be curious to cut the sugar if I made it again, but I don't know that I'll bother. I don't have a springform but it worked totally fine in my 3\" deep cake pan. Alison MSan Francisco2/9/2022This cake was delicious but I was not a fan of the icing. The icing was a lot of work for not much gain. I will definitely make again, maybe with a cream cheese icing.Christy AndrewsHouston1/26/2022I made this with 1/2 the sugar and salt.....perfect! I did not peel the apples and also used pecans instead of hazelnuts I eliminated the buttercream frosting and opted for a poured caramel frosting topped with whole toasted pecan halves. It was the hit of our monthly fellowship potluck. Kendall Savillemanning, Oregon12/2/2021I love this recipe but hate blanching hazelnuts, so sharing my pro tip: I order my hazelnuts from the American Hazelnut Company, which sells a variety where the skins are not bitter. So I use their hazelnuts, skip the blanching and just leave the skins on, and the recipe turns out perfectly and takes way less prep. RebekahMinneapolis11/18/2021In the October issue that feature this fabulous recipe, I noticed they mentioned currants in the description and than did not include them in the list of ingredients? I was curious why they were left out?  Are they in the original recipe?LizAmbler PA11/13/2021I made this cake for my birthday.  It was spectacular.  Just what I wanted/needed.  Made it exactly like it said, couldn't have been better - so moist, so flavorful, perfect combination of ignredients.  Thank you so much for making me so happy on my bday with the perfect finish to my day. xxooLuciaNew Haven, CT11/10/2021I just made this cake today.  The flavors are unique and I'd make it again, however, it's incredibly sweet, as one of the other reviewers mentioned.  I could easily see cutting the sugar in half for the cake, especially since the dates and apples provide plenty of sweetness.  In fact, the sweetness distracts from all the other flavors.  And this is coming from someone who LOVES sweet things.  I actually liked the frosting with it, but again, the overly sweet cake was distracting from the the whole ensemble.  Next time I make it I'll cut the sugar in half and add more spices.LynmaeSan Diego11/3/2021Absolutely delicious, and a wonderful departure\nfrom the average cake. Loved the contrast between the chewy side crust and the body of the cake, and the icing is perfection: the lightness and tang is a perfect\nfoil for the sweetness of the cake. I confess that I used golden monk fruit sweetener instead of sugar (cake ingredients like dates and rye seemed to beg for a healthier option) and it worked perfectly. The sophisticated flavors of this cake will make it a mainstay for me. \nVMillerNew Orleans10/20/2021Made this for a dinner party. I did use a 4th egg white and 1/4 cup extra butter in the frosting as I used a 10\" round pan. Very moist, very decadent - it will be on our Thanksgiving table in place of apple pie.Chris Forked River NJ10/3/2021Oh wow. This is delicious and beautiful on its own - doesn\u2019t need frosting at all.  If so would need something light and tangy - I like the idea of crema freche.    I had a slight issue w doneness - after 80 min I thought tester was clean but the very center was still mush when cutting. Oops.  Cut that part out and focused on the edges and, well,  this is a keeper for sure.  AnonymousBrooklyn NY10/3/2021I enjoyed the flavors, but it was very sweet. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t make the icing. The contrast between a crunchy outside and chewy inside was nice. My dough was very dry, definitely not sticky; I added more olive oil a bit at a time. Next time I\u2019ll probably add a 3rd egg. Anyone else have this issue?CindyColorado10/3/2021Cake was phenomenal. Buttercream was also very good, but not the right icing/frosting for this cake. The apple and spice sweetness vs the buttercream / lemon flavors was jarring. KathyNew Jersey10/3/2021Explore Bon App\u00e9titAppleFruitHazelnutNutRyeCakeDessertRecipes you want to make.
