Pro tip: If you sign up for the newsletter, you'll get the scoop before everyone else.Healthyish friends,I\u2019ve never been on a wellness retreat, or any other kind of retreat for that matter. I\u2019m just not much of a group travel person; the thought of going somewhere for multiple days with strangers to find my inner warrior princess or get over a breakup just doesn\u2019t sound like my idea of a vacation. I can\u2019t say that Sarah Treleavan\u2019s story on self-empowerment retreats changed my mind, but it did make me curious. I\u2019d take self-empowerment over weight loss or yoga (which is often weight-loss by another name) any day, but I think the question she poses at the end of her two-day \u201cI Am Worth It\u201d retreat experience is the same one I\u2019d be asking: \u201cWhat exactly were we accomplishing?\u201dSpeaking of weight loss, the idea that how much we weigh is solely based on our own choices\u2014what we eat, how much we exercise, how well we \u201ctake care of ourselves\u201d\u2014is a dangerous and intractable belief, and one that\u2019s fueled all kinds of body-shaming and disordered behavior. But there\u2019s more and more research, as this article points out, showing that the global increase in obesity could be way outside our individual control. Consider that all kinds of animals, from monkeys to marmosets, also weigh more than they used to, and that viruses, chemicals, and even temperature and light might be affecting the numbers on the scale.#DoingThingsInJeansAnd while we\u2019re on the subject of debunking myths, turns out Himalayan pink salt isn\u2019t better-tasting, healthier, or more sustainable. It\u2019s just salt. That is pink.One thing that\u2019s not a myth: The deliciousness of these Granola Cluster Cookies, which are gluten-free and dairy-free and now at the top of my To Bake list after I rediscovered this vintage video (okay, it\u2019s from 2017) of Carla making them.I have no good segue for this last link, other than to say I\u2019m here for all the new aesthetically minded sex toys and related products mentioned in this GQ piece. Because sometimes you forget to put your gold bangle handcuffs away in your vice drawer (don\u2019t act like you don\u2019t have a vice drawer) before the fridge repair person shows up. But at least you can prove that you have good taste.My other kink: making vegetarian arepas.Until next week,Amanda ShapiroHealthyish EditorExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishHealthyish NewsletteressayRead MoreLifestyleBreakfast Pastries, Work Lunches, and the Perfect LasagnaBy Amanda ShapiroRecipes you want to make.
