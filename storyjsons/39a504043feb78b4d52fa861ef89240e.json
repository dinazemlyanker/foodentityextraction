Ginger. Shrimp. Rum.: Caribbean Flavors for Every Season. \u201cHere, coconut milk delivers all of the creamy, comforting goodness without any of the full dairy heft, plus it adds a mild, nutty flavor that leans into brussels sprouts\u2019 natural savory sweetness. It has all the makings of a year-after-year holiday hit\u2014or even just a comforting, cold weather go-to.\u201dIngredients4 Servings1lb. brussels sprouts (20\u201322 small to medium heads)1Tbsp. plus 1\u00bd tsp. Diamond Crystal or 2\u00bd tsp. Morton kosher saltZest of 1 large lemon113.5-oz. can full-fat coconut milk2Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil1tsp. freshly ground black pepper1tsp. finely grated nutmeg1\u00bdcups unseasoned fine dry breadcrumbs or 1 sleeve crumbled Ritz crackersPreparationStep 1Preheat oven to 350\u00b0. Bring 4 cups water to a boil in a medium saucepan.Step 2Meanwhile, using a chef\u2019s knife, remove stems from each brussels sprout, then cut each head into quarters through stem end.Step 3Season boiling water with 1 Tbsp. Diamond Crystal or 1\u00be tsp. Morton salt, then add brussels sprouts and cook 4 minutes. Drain brussels sprouts in a colander and run the coldest possible tap water over sprouts, about 30 seconds. (Because the brussels sprouts will be baked, cold tap water works just as well as an ice water bath here; they don\u2019t need to be completely cooled.) Turn out brussels sprouts onto a kitchen towel and let drain.Step 4Whisk together lemon zest, coconut milk, oil, pepper, nutmeg, and remaining 1\u00bd tsp. Diamond Crystal or \u00be tsp. Morton kosher salt in a baking dish just large enough to fit brussels sprouts.Step 5Add brussels sprouts to baking dish and gently toss to coat. Scatter breadcrumbs over and bake, uncovered, until top is golden and coconut milk has thickened slightly, 30\u201335 minutes. Let cool 10 minutes before serving.How would you rate Coconut Brussels Sprouts Gratin?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (4)Back to TopTriangleMy new favorite way to eat Brussels sprouts.  Easy and tasty recipe.  Also vegan.  MonaNew York11/19/2021Honestly, if you don\u2019t like brussels sprouts, this will appeal to you. On the other hand, if you\u2019re fond of the vegetable already, you may be disappointed with how of the flavor of the sprouts takes a back seat in this recipe.K. DavieRockland, ME11/26/2020This recipe is ok as a side, but it's very bland as written and doesn't stand on its own. I would recommend increasing the amount of spices added, using cheese if non vegan, or finding some other ways to add additional flavor.Anonymous11/26/2020Used larger bread crumbs from the store and had to cook an extra few minutes to get golden brown crisp on top, but came out great!! 10/10 would make again and so easy and didn't really taste too coconutty! Really make sure the brussels are boiled and blanched well or else they'll be undercooked in the end! Non-vegans - I'd add pancetta and shaved parmesan!
