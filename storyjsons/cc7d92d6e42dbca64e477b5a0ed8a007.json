It's All About the MarinadeChicken, cauliflower, zingy chutney, and one simple yet highly effective ingredient make for a one-pan dinner that\u2019s anything but one-note.By Hilary CadiganNovember 28, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailFacebookTwitterEmailLet\u2019s start with a fact, because facts are all we can count on in this cruel world (kind of). The fact is this: Yogurt is the best meat marinade there is. Why? Well, science. Unlike some acidic marinades\u2014your vinegars, your citrus juices\u2014yogurt contains microbes and lactic acid, which peerlessly break down proteins and tenderize meat (no weird serrated hammers required) rather than toughening it. See, when you cook meat coated in a snuggly little blanket of yogurt, the heat caramelizes the milk solids in said yogurt, creating a crisp, smoky exterior and a hyper-tender interior, thanks to all the juices that get locked inside.This, friends, is the key to creating your new favorite all-in-one sheet-pan chicken dinner: Sheet-Pan Garam Masala Chicken, a dish so easy to make and so rewarding to eat that it\u2019ll break through your self-imposed salad-only post-Thanksgiving diet and get you back in front of your neglected oven (that romaine\u2019s poison anyway, y\u2019all).The first step to mastering this dish is an important one: You have to get the oven hot enough. This dish takes its inspiration from India, where meat marinated in spices and yogurt is sometimes cooked in a cylindrical clay oven called a tandoor, which is heated to temperatures up to 900 degrees. In our case, we\u2019re not getting quite that hot. But if you preheat your home oven to 425 and move one of the racks to the upper third, you\u2019ll still get the burnished, blistered skin and deep caramelization that makes tandoor cooking so delish.Next, it\u2019s marinade time. Grate up a three-inch piece of fresh ginger (definitely scrub it clean, but peeling is now officially optional), put one teaspoon aside, and dump the rest in a resealable plastic bag with two cups of whole milk Greek yogurt (I repeat! Whole milk!). Squeeze in a lemon\u2019s worth of juice, cayenne pepper, and garam masala\u2014which you can buy off the shelf or make yourself. Then seal up that bag and shake it, sh-shake it, shake it like a Polaroid picture\u2014seriously, classic white person Outkast reference aside, this is a good time to work out some rage and dance alone in your kitchen, a practice I recommend to all of you at least once a week.Now it\u2019s time to season your chicken pieces GENEROUSLY with kosher salt, stick \u2018em in that bag, and return to your bag-shaking dance\u2014working in batches if you need to (I did, which just meant more time for dancing). Once the chicken\u2019s good and covered, set it aside to marinate, at least 30 minutes at room temperature or up to four hours in the fridge. Meanwhile, chop up a big ol\u2019 head of cauliflower, drizzle \u2018n\u2019 toss with salt \u2018n\u2019 olive oil, and arrange it all evenly across a large, rimmed, foil-lined sheet pan. Part of the great joy of this dish is that it only requires one pan which means not only that you \ud83d\udea8ONLY HAVE TO WASH ONE PAN \ud83d\udea8but also that you can get away with not adding any exciting seasonings to the cauliflower\u2014it\u2019ll get its true flavor from what happens next, which is nestling your marinated chicken pieces in the middle of that cauliflower forest. As the chicken cooks, the cauliflower will soak up all the spiced chicken-y juices that come out. Mmmmm, spiced chicken-y juices.Serve this juicy yogurt-marinated chicken to the squad, or keep it all to yourself.\nSo yeah, stick that baby in the oven and let it go until the chicken skin is blistered, the meat is tender to the bone, and the cauliflower is good and charred. You\u2019ll want to turn the pan halfway through and move the chicken with tongs occasionally so it browns evenly, but the whole process shouldn\u2019t taken more than 40 minutes. Spend that time dancing. That\u2019s not a request. Your mom called me. She says you need it. It\u2019s been awhile. Times are hard.Okay well, you also need to spend some of those minutes preparing your chutney. But that\u2019s easy. Just be sure to rinse your onion in cold water after you chop it to tone down the harshness.At this point, your kitchen will be smelling real good because your one-pan dinner is ready to party. Your chicken should be crisp on the outside, tender on the inside, and a wee bit spicy all over. Dolloping it with that zesty-zingy chutney lends contrast, keeping the meat-n-veg from tasting one-note and bringing the whole meal together with balance. Now all you have to do is eat up, then pat yourself on the back. For we should consider every day lost in which we have not danced at least once. And we should call every truth false which was not accompanied by at least one yogurt-marinated chicken.Winner, winner, sheet-pan chicken dinner!Sheet-Pan Garam Masala ChickenMarinating in spiced yogurt gets you a juicy and super-tender chicken every time.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titSheet-Pan DinnersYogurtGreek YogurtBasicallyChickenGaram MasalaCauliflowerRecipes you want to make.
