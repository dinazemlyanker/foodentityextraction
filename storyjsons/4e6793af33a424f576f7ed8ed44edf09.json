This harborside shed, a healthy bike ride out of town (though not too far from Noma 2.0), has two personalities: a stay-all-day spot with a sauna, available year-round, and in warmer months, a swimming spot with natural wines.TAKE IN THE: view! In winter, it\u2019s a caf\u00e9 with breakfast, lunch, and a handful of tables for the evening tasting menu, a Nordic affair using Italian ingredients. Regulars bring their bathing suits for the sauna, and during long summer nights, the pier fills with swimmers and natural wine drinkers who dip between sips.THE VIBE IS: casual and incredibly charming.PRACTICAL STUFF: From October through April, it\u2019s open every day: Monday to Friday from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. and Saturday and Sunday from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. From May through September, it\u2019s open every day: Monday to Friday from 8 a.m. to 11 p.m. and Saturday and Sunday from 9 a.m. to 11 p.m. Dinner is available during the winter via reservation, Thursday to Sunday from 6 p.m. to 11 p.m.\u2014Christine MuhlkePhoto by Ditte IsagerPhoto by Ditte IsagerWE ALSO LOVEAmassHidden in Refshale\u00f8en, an elaborate root-to-stem tasting menuRel\u00e6Live a little with the N\u00f8rrebro tasting-menu restaurant that\u2019s still making waves Den VandretteGet your L\u2019Anglore fix at this sunny Indre By wine barExplore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
