Obliterate your ginger.By Sarah JampelFebruary 11, 2022FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Alex Lau, Food Styling by Rebecca Jurkevich, Prop Styling by Kalen KaminskiFacebookTwitterEmailAll products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Examples: swapping in a new kitchen sponge, drinking a glass of water, taking a shower (JK\u2014or am I?).So when I found myself frantically grating ginger into a pot of sizzling onions, making no headway against its hairy fibers, I thought: When\u2019s the last time I replaced this Microplane? I took out my phone, ordered a new blade, and smiled, knowing that the most terrible kitchen task of all was about to get a whole lot less terrible after my shiny new tool arrived.If you, too, love your Microplane, you probably push it to its limits\u2014grating ginger, yes, but also garlic, fresh chiles, chocolate bars, and hard cheese (so much cheese). I probably use my Microplane to zest a lemon or lime every single day. And just like the edge of a knife, the blade of a Microplane dulls over time. With enough use, it becomes a worn-down razor (note to self: replace my razor blade), scratching and scraping rather than shaving sharply and smoothly. Not only does that make your job harder (I repeat: grating ginger is terrible; grating ginger is more terrible with an old Microplane), it also makes your job a little riskier. With the nub of ginger\u2014or the clove of garlic\u2014getting caught on the blade rather than disintegrating into the void below, it\u2019s more likely you\u2019ll snag a finger or a knuckle. Ouch!So if you also can\u2019t remember the last time you replaced your Microplane, consider this your call to action.
