We\u2019ve said that the only good thing about it is that it\u2019s abundant and cheap\u2014always around but never what you want. We\u2019ve said that if we were drafting a team for summer produce kickball, it\u2019d be our last pick. Even the striped or wacky-shaped zucchini still tastes like...nothing.\u201cZucchini is basically horrible and there are no exceptions,\u201d wrote food director Carla Lalli Music. \u201cSad,\u201d said editor in chief Adam Rapoport.Sorry, zucchini. It\u2019s not you\u2014well, it kind of is you\u2014it\u2019s mostly us. Just because a zucchini isn\u2019t a tomato (slice, salt, eat, done), doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t be wonderful, valuable, and worthwhile. There are two guaranteed good ways to cajole zucchini into deliciousness.First up: lots of heat, which will produce seared or charred surfaces and blistered skins. Zucchini is 94 to 95% water. In this case, \u201cwatery\u201d is not an insult but a fact. Introducing it to heat early on, either on the stove or on the grill (or even in the oven at a high temp), allows you to get big pieces of zucchini nice and browned before the water seeps out and impedes the process. Once the zucchini is caramelizing, you\u2019ll continue to cook it until it's until tender all the way through\u2014a paring knife or a fork should slip in without much resistance\u2014but not yet mushy.This marinated zucchini might be the best thing about summer.\nPhoto by Chelsie Craig, Food Styling by Molly Baz, Prop Styling by Emily EisenThis method gives you zucchini that\u2019s sliceable (not spoonable!) and, since some of the water has cooked off, primed to absorb intense dressings and marinades (we like them garlicky, herby, spicy, and glaze-y). For extra insurance, salt the sliced zucchini ahead of time to jumpstart the water-wicking process.The second great way to cook zucchini: to death. By which we mean low and slow, until much of that moisture seeps out and bubbles away, leaving the zucchini to fall apart into a jammy sauce with a concentrated zuke flavor (earthy, vegetal, sweet!) that\u2019s perfect for spreading on toast or tossing through pasta. In this Ratatouille Pasta, pieces of zucchini are cooked for around 30 minutes, until they\u2019re nearly unrecognizable (in a good way).No matter which road you\u2019re taking\u2014hot and fast or low and slow\u2014don\u2019t forget the acid: Zucchini needs brightness in the form of citrus juice, vinegar, or even pickle brine to wake the heck up after being blasted with heat.And if all else fails, bow to the great redeemer: zucchini bread.Zucchini + pasta = a match made in heaven:Ratatouille PastaIf we were to round up an all-star team of summer's greatest produce, it'd look a little something like ratatouille: Eggplant and zucchini. Peppers and tomatoes. The gang's all here!View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titZucchiniSummer SquashYellow SquashRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
