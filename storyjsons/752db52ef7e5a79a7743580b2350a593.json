Like carbonara not eaten immediately or risotto that sits for more than a few moments, the essence of this dish fades just as quickly as it comes together. These crispy-creamy fritters shine with all kinds of accoutrements, from your favorite pesto and leafy greens to fresh or sun-dried tomatoes and some warm ciabatta.\u2014Ozoz Sokoh, recipe developerAll products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Tried these out yesterday and I single handedly devoured these and could have done with more. Great recipe, and would definitely make as entrees. Thanks for sharing!JeanneVictoria, Australia8/28/2021So delicious! It does need plenty of salt in the flour as mozzarella is so mild - so don't skimp. Added a big handful of tomatoes from the garden to make it a bit more voluminous for supper. AJLondon, UK8/26/2021They are easy and great. Fun to serve as a quick appetizer. I tried air frying it too, and it worked well that way. I will try a vegan cheese next time to see how that pans out. Mix some spices and herbs in the panko and jazz it up a bit for different flavors.  India B.Greensboro, NC8/11/2021I made this one as soon as I saw it in BA. It turned out wonderful and was totally satisfying.  David MMill Valley, CA8/10/2021I  intend to make this tomorrow night...so easy!!!AnonymousNew Jersey 8/10/2021Delicious, easy and quick.  Makes dinner for myself & my husband. I like to add chopped fresh basil for garnish.  I think combinations of herbs or nothing else is fine as there is pesto.  Pesto is salty, that's why fresh herbs , balsamic & olive oil to dip bread.  Folks can be creative.Steff C.Seattle8/9/2021Instead of pesto, I think this recipe would be much better with a homemade Marinara sauce.PeterIllinois8/8/2021Explore Bon App\u00e9titFritterSaladLeafy GreensVegetableMozzarellaCheeseQuickEasySideStarterVegetarianFryDinnerRecipes you want to make.
