In her monthly column, nearly lifelong vegetarian Sarah Jampel will tackle cooking, eating, and navigating the world meat-free\u2014even when her grandma still doesn't know what she makes for dinner.As a vegetarian, I\u2019m constantly on the lookout for easy, protein-rich accompaniments that will lend a semblance of balance to my meals and, most importantly, ward off hunger for a reasonable amount of time.On the most desperate nights, that\u2019s a spoonful of peanut butter or exactly seven almonds (OMG, remember the good times???). But on the best nights\u2014and when I\u2019ve done even minimal meal prep over the weekend\u2014it\u2019s a mound of marinated lentils. \u201cMarinated lentils\u201d is just a fancy term for cooked lentils (beluga or Le Puy) tossed with olive oil that\u2019s been infused with all sorts of delicious spices, aromatics, seeds, and hard herbs (rosemary, sage, thyme). Claire Saffitz\u2019s recipe takes a minimal approach\u2014heat oil with coriander and cumin seeds for a minute\u2014whereas Alison Roman\u2019s Spiced Lentils with Spring Onions in Dining In pull out all the stops: The oil is heated on low for 20 to 25 minutes with coriander, fennel, and cumin seeds, red pepper flakes, and sliced garlic; strips of lemon peel and scallions or spring onions are added for the last 5 minutes. You can vary the oil infusion\u2014as spicy or herby or lemony or garlicky or seedy\u2014as you\u2019d like.Marinated lentils are better than regular old boiled lentils because they, uh, taste better. (And they\u2019re better than marinated dried beans because they cook so much faster.) I understand and abide by the concept of adding a halved onion and a couple bay leaves to the lentil cooking liquid, but it never seems to impart enough (if any) flavor. Oil, on the other hand, is a much more effective flavor-carrier: Even a couple tablespoons of infused oil will transform lentils into something I'm ready to spoon directly into my mouth, no enhancements necessary. Marinating lentils doesn't take any additional time: Just heat the oil as the lentils cook, then toss the two together, and eat. If you have any leftovers, that's even better: Let the lentils hang out in any extra oil and they'll get even better in the fridge over the next few days.So when my dinner ends up looking like a collection of what other people might call sides, I make these lentils. They\u2019re as good on their own as they are tossed into a leafy salad, nestled onto a sweet potato, or mixed into cook grains with herbs and cheese. The added fat from the infused oil makes the lentils rich and luxurious and improves anything plain-ish that you toss with them. If I\u2019m really on my game, I\u2019ll double the spiced oil and keep it in a jar in the fridge, turning to it whenever I\u2019m saut\u00e9ing greens, frying eggs, roasting broccoli or squash or cherry tomatoes, stirring together a lemony yogurt sauce, or making a vinaigrette.Now I'm really meal-planning.Make these lentils tonight:Marinated Lentils with Crunchy VegetablesView RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishLentilVegetarianThe Not Depressing VegetarianRead MoreLifestyleBlack Lentils Are the Best Lentil for Meal Prep, PeriodBy Aliza AbarbanelRecipes you want to make.
