If you sign up for our newsletter, you\u2019ll get her letter before everyone else.It\u2019s Diwali this week, a holiday we honor in my family with lots of parties and lots of sugar. Diwali is a celebration of good over evil and light over darkness, but the joke is that really it\u2019s a celebration of sweets. It\u2019s rude to show up somewhere without a tray of mithai\u2014the catchall term for a wide roster of sugary confections\u2014and it\u2019s even more rude not to accept one when offered, which creates a vicious cycle of glycemic overload for all involved.This year, without easy access to an Indian grocery store and without parties to host or attend, I\u2019m kind of on my own. I\u2019m thinking I\u2019ll make tiny batches of mithai based on what I have around: apples from the CSA grated and mixed with coconut for apple burfi, condensed milk and milk powder cooked down for pistachio-studded peda, finely chopped dates and walnuts rolled together with ghee for ladoos.\u00a0Want this letter before it hits the website?\u00a0Sign up for our newsletter!Photo by Laura Murray, Food Styling by Susan SpungenBut if I get homesick, I\u2019ll probably also try my hand at gajar ka halwa\u2014a spoon-y, almost pudding-like carrot dessert that I love\u2014or this cardamom-pistachio carrot cake inspired by it, both which can be found on Bon App\u00e9tit. On Epicurious, we curated 50-ish more recipes, both savory and sweet, including creamy cardamom kheer and sticky-sweet gulab jamun, desserts I\u2019ve never made myself (yet) but that are synonymous with the festivities to me.I\u2019m curious to know what sweets you make to celebrate special occasions. Are there any pastries, cookies, cakes, or other confections you turn to every year? If so, are you making them this year too, or are you changing it up in some way? I\u2019d love to hear your stories. As always, I\u2019m at sonia@bonappetit.com.Explore Bon App\u00e9titLetter From The EditorRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
