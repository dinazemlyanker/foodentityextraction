She\u2019s sporting loud paisley prints in all shades of blue\u2014a party of one at 3 p.m. We sit at a high-top table on the perimeter of the dance floor, chatting about how she opened this bar 12 years ago; the doors are open to the patio and I can feel the velvet sun, ubiquitous over Hillcrest, warming my legs.We\u2019re in San Diego\u2019s historic gayborhood, as the locals call it, on a stretch of University Avenue that is home to at least six gay bars (boys bars, as Girton calls them). Gossip, the block\u2019s sole dive intended for women, stands out among them. Girton settled in San Diego in 1999\u2014a time when, she remembers, women weren\u2019t welcome at boys bars. She says San Diego lesbians in those days were \u201cspoiled\u201d with three venues to choose from: Club Bombay (later renamed Six Degrees), The Flame, and another called Patti\u2019s Bar. One by one, however, they closed down. Since Gossip opened in 2009, it\u2019s been the only brick-and-mortar lesbian bar in all of Southern California, including Los Angeles.Photograph by Kimberly MotosThe phenomenon of the vanishing lesbian bar isn\u2019t unique to California. Over the past several decades, the U.S. has been hemorrhaging queer female spaces. In the 1980s, over 200 lesbian-identified bars were scattered around the country. Today, only 21 are, according to the fundraising and advocacy initiative Lesbian Bar Project.But while lesbian bars are disappearing, that need for safe community spaces is not. Queer women remain vulnerable: In early August, a group including Gossip employees was assaulted at San Diego\u2019s Mission Beach. The group was celebrating a birthday when two men, yelling anti-LGBT+ slurs, allegedly threw a beer can at one of their heads and even pulled out a gun.I\u2019m not shocked by the story. I was raised 25 minutes up the freeway from Gossip, in a plain, suburban tract that I felt made Hillcrest and all its rainbow flags look like Mars. As a teenager, I had a vague sense that Hillcrest was the \u201cgay\u201d part of town, but nothing about the storefronts lined with rhinestone jockstraps and the rows of sweaty, pulsating nightclubs felt welcoming to me\u2014a closeted soft femme bisexual kid with anxiety. Although Gossip Grill opened when I was in high school, I still didn\u2019t know it existed by the time I moved away for college, nor did I understand its significance within the queer community I\u2019d soon call my own.I\u2019ve come across several explanations for the fragility of sapphic-friendly spaces, not just in California but throughout the U.S. For one, lesbian bars\u2014as many queer bars\u2014have a troubled relationship with racial inclusivity, in spite of their intended role as oases for the marginalized. Several of the first and most influential dyke bars in New York City discriminated against people of color, according to the Lesbian Bar Project. Bonnie and Clyde\u2019s, one of the city\u2019s first lesbian bars to be owned and operated by a woman, opened in 1971 when women weren\u2019t eligible for business loans without a man\u2019s signature. But in the 11 years that the bar was open, management implemented what artist and archivist Gwen Shockey described in a Lesbian Bar Project documentary as an \u201cunspoken, race-based quota at the door,\u201d by which only two or three women of color would be let in at any given time.At Gossip Grill, Girton says the collective reckoning around Black Lives Matter in the summer of 2020 forced her to acknowledge her own shortcomings as a white business owner and helped her imagine a path to greater inclusivity in her establishments. Her first step was to adapt her hiring practices. \u201cAs diverse as I thought we were, we had a lot of growing to do,\u201d she says. The pandemic had resulted in massive gaps in her staff; when she was finally able to fill them earlier this year, Girton knew she wanted to be more intentional about diversity. At Gossip, she says 27 out of 50 staffers are people of color, including the head chef and lead host. At Barrel & Board, her new restaurant, she says it\u2019s 14 of the 23, including one of the managers.Lesbian bars may be shuttering because they struggle to practice gender inclusivity too. The term lesbian can hardly encapsulate everyone living with a marginalized gender or sexual identity. Girton says part of the reason Gossip is the last remaining lesbian bar in Southern California is because, well, it isn\u2019t.\u201cWe\u2019re not a lesbian bar. We\u2019re a women\u2019s bar,\u201d Girton emphasizes during our initial meeting. \u201cUnder that women\u2019s umbrella is gay, straight, bi, trans, pan, you name it. It includes everything in there. Our focus is number one, women. Number two, LGBTQ+. We are open to everyone.\u201dA few days later, Brittany Rae Leach, Gossip\u2019s head of marketing, joins me at the bar during off hours. She has a big smile and auburn hair that\u2019s been waved with precision. When she talks about Gossip, she crackles like a bonfire. She says the decision to identify as a women\u2019s bar and not a lesbian bar is not only motivated by appearances or the bottom line. If anything, it\u2019s personal. \u201cOur choice to view ourselves as a women\u2019s bar affects so many people very deeply rooted in our community,\u201d Leach says. \u201cIt was really important to us to be inclusive and as far away from hypocritical as possible.\u201dGossip Grill is a community space for queer women. Dina Johnson, a sterile processing tech at a nearby hospital and a Gossip regular for the last 12 years, uses the bar as a home base for various fundraising efforts benefiting the local homeless community. When she learned that Gossip was struggling to keep its doors open in the pandemic, she started a GoFundMe to raise money for out-of-work staff members and to pay off the bar\u2019s lingering utility bills. At first, Johnson only asked for $1,000. But donors exceeded that $1,000 mark in fewer than three days.\u201cA lot of people didn\u2019t just donate $10 or $15. They donated hundreds. That\u2019s how much this place is loved,\u201d she says. \u201cIf I were to need anything, I\u2019m pretty sure [Moe] wouldn\u2019t say no to me. Moe is always for it, whatever I\u2019m doing.\u201dSeated at the high-top at our first meeting, Girton regales me with tidbits of Gossip history. In 2011, during the county-wide blackout that left 1.4 million residents without power, the community flocked to the bar. Chris Shaw, founder of Gossip\u2019s parent company, Mo\u2019s Universe, had a generator installed on-site, prompting staff to throw an impromptu dance party that became an annual event. When the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando happened in 2016, the community grieved at Gossip. When Biden was elected president in November 2020, that same crowd partied here. \u201cWhenever something happens and nobody knows what to do, they come here,\u201d Girton says. \u201cThis is important. This is home.\u201dErica Rose, who created the Lesbian Bar Project with Elina Street, tells me over Zoom that the struggle for space has defined, and in turn confined, lesbian life across the country. \u201cQueer women never occupied neighborhoods in the same way that gay men have,\u201d Rose says. She notes that while gay male communities have managed to colonize entire neighborhoods, there are no lesbian equivalents. And the pandemic, which already burdened small-business owners, disproportionately impacted women.The lesbian businesses that are going to survive for decades to come will have to follow Gossip\u2019s example and shape-shift into something beyond a bar. \u201cWe need to look for new ways that bars can serve the current generation\u2019s needs,\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019re becoming community centers. They\u2019re becoming restaurants, spaces for family, spaces with sober options, spaces for political organizing. Lesbian bars are more than just bars.\u201dGirton and her team are reenvisioning divey, gritty, one-note lesbian spaces to offer variety to lesbians and queers seeking sanctuary from the horde of masc and normative nightlife options. Across the street from Gossip Grill, they opened the upscale sit-down restaurant Barrel & Board this past June to do just that.\u201cWe\u2019ve grown up,\u201d Leach says at our off-hours meeting. \u201cAnd all of us who grew up with Gossip say, \u2018I love Gossip, I\u2019ll always support Gossip, but sometimes I just really want to get a babysitter\u2014because yes, I have children now\u2014and just go have a really nice glass of wine.\u2019 Opening Barrel was always about listening to the community and giving them what they want.\u201dBarrel & Board\u2014along with SALAD to-go-go, a queer-friendly salad bar and another new property Girton opened just next door\u2014was a pandemic purchase. Girton and her business partners bought the space for Barrel in February, when they feared Gossip wouldn\u2019t make it through the month. The place came together quickly, acquired in working order from the Cohn Restaurant Group and in need of only light touches. Girton\u2019s team rearranged the suspended tricycle sculpture in the bathroom, stacked whiskey barrels by the fireplace on the back patio, and added a few living trees to the interior speakeasy-type bar already outfitted with ornate chandeliers and melted wax candelabras. As for the fare, my boards (slabs of refinished tree trunks) come piled high with local pickled veggies, house-made hummuses and tzatzikis, gooey burratas, and little balsamic pearls, all meant to be shared around a table. The mojo grilled fish taco board, a specialty, features baby carrot escab\u00e8che and jalape\u00f1o slaw served on a bed of purple cabbage. The place is elegant and dapper\u2014the perfect foil to the deliciously sloppy late-night scene across the street.Photography by Kimberly MotosLeach has a dreamy look in her eye as she describes the two properties. \u201cBarrel is so pretty,\u201d she says with a sigh. \u201cAnd Gossip is the gay \u2018Cheers.\u2019\u201d She swears that if a regular walks in during one of longtime bartender Freda Horton\u2019s shifts at the latter spot, their drink will already be made by the time they take their seat at the bar.Horton\u2019s eyes, adorned with a pair of falsies, glitter above a rainbow face mask. She nods. \u201cIt\u2019s that sense of belonging that we all yearn for. [Coming into Gossip is] like being able to walk in at home and open the refrigerator. That\u2019s what we offer here. That level of comfort.\u201dAs a teenager, San Diego never felt like home to me because I didn\u2019t know of any place in all the county's great sprawl where I could be myself. I finally discovered Gossip this year, as an adult living back at home through the pandemic. When I learned that Girton had carved out the only lesbian haven within a 300-mile radius that had not only survived a pandemic, but also thrived for 12 years, I was bewildered. Gossip, and all the spaces spinning out of it, feel miraculous.In the weeks that follow my conversations, I go back to Barrel for dinner and Gossip for a few drinks on a busy Friday night. I am braless and barefaced, aside from blue eyeliner applied without finesse. I smile at Horton behind the bar. I brush up against some cute girls. And I feel decades of shame and apprehension start to melt off my back and flow down to the well-trampled concrete floor.Explore Bon App\u00e9titLifestyleCultureRecipes you want to make.
