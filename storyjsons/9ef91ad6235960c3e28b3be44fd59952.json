I\u2019ve made this multiple times and it\u2019s always a crowd favorite. Easy enough to make for a low key week day and exciting enough to be a star at the potluck AnonymousChicago 7/3/2020This recipe was good, but I really want to char all of the corn next time.  To get a even better elote-like dish I would also add a little chili powder to the mix,GrcisgoneGreenville, WI6/19/2020The original recipe was perfect!! Why change the recipe? Why not just make a new page? Ugh BA!Anonymous7/13/2019I also made the earlier version of BA's charred and raw corn salad many times, but with cojita instead of yogurt and parmesan.  I often don't have cojita on hand so just omit it, and it is fantastic. In that version, the shallot and raw corn are marinated in the vinaigrette while you grill the corn. I think it would also be great with all charred corn, but the raw corn adds a wonderful texture and marinating it briefly really deepens the flavour.  AnonymousToronto5/26/2019I wonder if you can't char all the corn. I love charred corn and the lime and cilantro would taste so great.\nAnonymousRockland County, NY8/18/2018Has the recipe been changed? I made it last summer and was revisiting it, but it didn't call for yogurt and it had cotija cheese in place of parmesan.AnonymousChicago7/31/2018Fantastic summer salad! I have fixed this many times now four large family grill outs and Mexican fiestas. It is always the first thing to go and people rave over it. I like to also add red and orange bell pepper and parboiled zucchini and it turns into a chunky vegetable salad worthy of a meal!AnonymousColorado3/8/2018Explore Bon App\u00e9titSaladMexicanLatin AmericanCornVegetableFresno ChileChileCilantroHerbs & SpicesSummerEasySideGluten-FreeNut-FreeVegetarianHealthyishSaut\u00e9Recipes you want to make.
