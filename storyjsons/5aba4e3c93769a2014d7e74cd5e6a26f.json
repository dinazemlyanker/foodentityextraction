Pro tip: If you sign up for the newsletter, you'll get the scoop before everyone else.Healthyish friends,Are red sauce restaurants healthyish? Let\u2019s not think about it too much. Yesterday Bon App\u00e9tit launched Red Sauce America, an ode to and exploration of Italian-American restaurants across the country. If you were raised (like I was) in a town brimming with these kind of joints, you might think you already know what this cultural phenomenon is all about. In that case, I challenge you to dig into the beautiful and surprising collection of stories here. Of course there\u2019s Roxane Gay\u2019s moving essay on finding a home\u2014and a favorite red sauce restaurant\u2014in Los Angeles. I also loved this piece by Chris Ying, who asks what it will take for Chinese-American food to assimilate the way Italian-American food has. Read Hilary Cadigan\u2019s interview with Silvio, a waiter from Croatia who\u2019s worked at the same red sauce restaurant in Williamsburg since the \u201970s. And Mike Sula\u2019s profile of Arturo Aucaquizhpi, the Ecuadorian immigrant carrying on the red sauce legacy in Chicago. And if you want to know about the go-to Italian place in my hometown, probably don\u2019t read this piece about my three decades at Sergio\u2019s, because it has nothing to do with the (very good) pizza. But, going back to my opening question, Sergio\u2019s did have a really great salad bar.This Week on HealthyishHave you heard of the climate diet? It\u2019s hard, it\u2019s expensive, and it\u2019s the way we\u2019ll probably have to eat in the not-too-distant future. Alejandra Borunda tries the diet for a week to get a peek at what\u2019s to come. Uh, until then, how about some chicken with schmaltzy rice?! Chris Morocco adapted the recipe from Fancy Nancy in Brooklyn, and it\u2019s definitely a plate-licker. (Don\u2019t worry, there\u2019s a lot of kale in there too.) Is it weird that I want to plan a trip to Florida just to check out a home goods store? Zo\u00eb Sessums, proud Florida native, reports from Yield Work Shop in St. Augustine.What I\u2019m ReadingAriel Levy\u2019s The Rules Do Not Apply. What\u2019s the difference between solitude and loneliness? The link between what we eat and our mental health. The whole Belief issue of Topic, but especially these ten scammer stories and this essay about moving away from Christianity and toward a different kind of faith.What I\u2019m CookingJust kidding. I moved this week, and cooking is still an impossibility. But I have to tell you about these pot racks I installed yesterday, which are bringing me great joy and extra cabinet space. And The Home Edit, which came into my life at just the right time and has provided me with almost too many great organization ideas.Until next week,Amanda ShapiroHealthyish EditorExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyish NewsletterHealthyishessayRead MorerestaurantsMy Three Decades of Pizza at Sergio\u2019sBy Amanda ShapiroRecipes you want to make.
