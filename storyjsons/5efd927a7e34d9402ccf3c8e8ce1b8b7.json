Pro tip: If you sign up for the newsletter, you'll get the scoop before everyone else.Dear Healthyish friends,As of this writing, I haven\u2019t left the house for six days except to go on solo walks or bike rides. Since last week\u2019s newsletter (which I have to keep reminding myself was ONLY SEVEN DAYS AGO) it\u2019s felt like my world and the world at large have both been upended several times over. At the pace we\u2019re all going, I expect both will have changed a few more times before you read this.While on the phone last night (I\u2019ve been doing a lot of that lately), a friend brought to my attention that I\u2019ve been zooming around (zooming and \u201cZooming\u201d) at breakneck speed recently. She\u2019s not wrong: My instinct during these fast-paced times has been to match the speed of my surroundings. So I\u2019ve been cooking more, working more, biking more, cleaning more, FaceTiming more. I\u2019ve been flying\u2014in a bad way. After dropping my laptop and almost tripping down half a flight of stairs yesterday, I\u2019ve realized it\u2019s time for me to slow down and be gentle to myself, first. That goes for cooking, too: I want to cook only if I think it will make me feel better, not because I need it to serve as temporary relief from my all-encompassing anxiety. And yet, I still get hungry three or more times a day. And so, I keep cooking. Here\u2019s what I\u2019ve been up to in the kitchen this week.Photo by Christina ChaeyYep, I\u2019m Still Eating BeansI normally have a relatively low bean tolerance, which is to say: I get sick of them after day two. But recently they\u2019ve brought me more comfort than fatigue, and one of the most delightful things I\u2019ve cooked this week was a riff on this Lentil and Egg Stew made with cooked cranberry beans instead of lentils. If you\u2019ve never taken the time to make a soffrito before, there\u2019s no better time to try. The mix of finely chopped vegetables, slowly cooked in olive oil until they\u2019ve almost melted away, anchors this stew with incredible flavor. I\u2019ve saved the method in the #gentlefoods Highlights on my Instagram if you want to follow along.+1 for Freezer BreadI\u2019ve been making my freezer work overtime these last couple of weeks, using it to store 1-2 servings of things I\u2019ve been cooking like chicken soup, dashi, and cooked grains. My biggest small pleasure these days is the stash of She Wolf Bakery bread I\u2019ve sliced and stored in freezer bags, ready to toast on a whim. It\u2019s something I do almost every time I buy a loaf of good bread I know I won\u2019t be able to finish myself. I\u2019ve been eating slices toasted under the aforementioned bean stew (a prime example of crispy gone soggy), with thick layers of almond butter and jam, and with good butter as a snack.Photo by Christina ChaeyCycling FuelI\u2019ve needed my bikes more than ever these days. My commuter bike is a practical alternative to public transit (not that I have many places to go these days), while my road bike is for longer weekend rides and post-work laps around the park. Last weekend, I rode 40 miles to the Rockaways and back with a few homemade onigiri stuffed in my jersey pockets to share with friends (from 6-10 feet away). It seems I\u2019ll be doing most of my rides alone for a while because social distancing is REAL here in NYC, but I still want a snack to look forward to, like these Nut Butter Granola Bars or Cocoa-Nut Energy Bites.On-Demand FishAs disorienting as everything feels right now, I\u2019ve been inspired by the ingenuity that can come out of chaos. My favorite neighborhood restaurants are not only selling their stock of wines at retail prices, many of them are also selling pre-batched cocktails (not gonna lie, a dirty martini from the Four Horsemen sounds pre-ttay good right about now). Basically editor Sarah Jampel forwarded me an email chain from Pierless Fish, a seafood supplier that typically services restaurants, but is now offering fresh and frozen fish delivery to customers\u2019 doors at a discount. I have shrimp, halibut, cod, and Arctic char on the way and am already dreaming of what I\u2019ll cook with them, starting with this Sesame Arctic Char Donabe. (If you live in New York and also want in, email Sam at SGorton@pierlessfish.com.)Keep cooking,Christina ChaeyAssociate editorExplore Bon App\u00e9titWhat's Chaey Cooking?HealthyishRead MoreLifestyleWhen I\u2019m Feeling Chaotic, Gentle Food is There for MeBy Christina ChaeyRecipes you want to make.
