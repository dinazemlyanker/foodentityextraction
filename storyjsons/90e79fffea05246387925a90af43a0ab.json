I\u2019ve gone through fancy phases (organic Assam), run-of-the-mill phases (Twinings English Breakfast), and boutique phases (Steven Smith Lord Bergamot). But no matter what I might have going on the side, I am never without my bottomless cache of PG Tips, which was, until very recently, the top selling tea in the U.K.I\u2019ve been drinking this extremely affordable, no-frills brand for longer than I can remember, and what I love about it is its deep, dark, malty, rich, smack-you-in-the-face qualities. My morning ritual involves two pyramid tea bags, 16 ounces of just-boiled water, 3 minutes of brew time, and an insulated beverage container to keep things steamy as I dole out cupfuls at a time. I add enough milk to achieve shopping-bag-brown color, and sometimes, if I\u2019m feeling special, I\u2019ll add a half spoon of sugar. Being a tea drinker might sound sedate, but within half an hour I am as amped as a race horse and raring to go!There\u2019s not a lot of pretense in a cup of PG Tips, despite the fact that it inspired little prince George\u2019s nickname \u201cTips.\u201d It\u2019s strong, but never tastes bitter. It\u2019s robust but not muddy, inexpensive without tasting cheap. In 2018, the company started making completely biodegradable pyramid bags, which sweetens the deal, even on the days when I skip the sugar. After all these years\u2014and all these tea phases\u2014it is forever my morning beverage of choice. Coffee can wait.Buy it:\u00a0PG Tips, $6 on AmazonAll products featured on Bonappetit.com are independently selected by our editors.
