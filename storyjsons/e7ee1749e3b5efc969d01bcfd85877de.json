She\u2019s fresh off the release of her third studio album, JP3, and the just-in-time-for-summer rendering doesn\u2019t disappoint: There are shoutouts to nourishing your heart and body\u2014from the food you eat to the company you keep\u2014laced with her signature vivacity, sex-positivity, and heaps of Caribbean vibes thanks to her Trinidadian-Jamaican roots. The 26-year-old recently wrapped her first film, Support the Girls, and now she\u2019s learning, unlearning, and basking in the rollercoaster journey of becoming her best self. The rapper caught up with us about the perks of keeping her diet mostly nutritious, how complex feelings spurred by trips to Trader Joe\u2019s inspired the album\u2019s first single, and the new addition to her skincare routine that has her feeling like Angela Bassett.What you eat has been a consistent theme in your music over the years. Why is that important to you?It\u2019s important for me to put things in my body that I know will give it life, not bring it any closer to death. I really like how I feel when I eat well. I feel a significant difference in my productivity, in how I\u2019m treating people, in my patience, my tolerance, all of that is heightened when I\u2019m eating well.What are some things you like to make?I love to make salads with boiled eggs and tangerines on it and some chia seeds. I like to make stuff that you don\u2019t even really have to put fire to. Just stuff you can eat raw and it\u2019s still delicious and filling. I love to make smoothies with a lot of spinach in it. My smoothies are always like liquid salads. I\u2019m obsessed with sardines. I love eating them with Trader Joe\u2019s multigrain crackers or the multigrain & flaxseed water crackers, and they\u2019re very good in omega-3s and iron.What about preparing Trinidadian and Jamaican food?I haven\u2019t finessed dishes from my culture yet, unfortunately. I know I need to. I need to be that auntie with the fire macaroni pie, with the fire curry chicken. My friends and I always say we need to get on top of this because we can\u2019t just be out here not carrying on the legacy.Right, first-generation struggles! On the theme of growth in your life that\u2019s been reflected in your diet, how does that apply to your forthcoming album JP3?On this new album, I feel like I am complaining less and celebrating more. Celebrating my growth and just me. My last projects I addressed things that bothered me in relationships and now I don\u2019t want to dedicate my music to that anymore. I\u2019ve always wanted to use my music as a reminder that us Black women are loveable. We don\u2019t have to be seen as being angry, even though that\u2019s fine. We can be angry if we want to, but there\u2019s much more to us so I\u2019m exploring that.What was the inspiration behind the album\u2019s first single, Trader Joe?Trader Joe is a song about me liking someone but loving myself more and choosing to continue to put myself first even if this person is fun. I just wanted to flip it...and I\u2019m always at Trader Joe's.I hope they play your song at the store. That would be so fun to shop to.Now I\u2019m scared to even go back. Before all the locations got busy, I used to go to the one on Long Island which was clutch because it was super empty. It\u2019s super chill. Even though they would hate to see me and my mother there. Literally somebody in line was like, \u201cUgh, they have the outsiders here today.\u201d I\u2019m like, \"If this where y\u2019all shopping, Imma shop here too. I need the good stuff too.\"Grocery shopping at Trader Joe\u2019s in New York can be so stressful! It\u2019s so chaotic, you feel so rushed, the lines\u2026I try to go during the week because I feel the same way. Part of the song was inspired by me having to take these trips and making the decision: Do you just want to go deal with everything on your own or do you want to go with a big Black man to just handle it? (Laughs) Of course, I\u2019ve done that once. But I prefer to just go alone and carry my own groceries if he\u2019s not gonna just do it for me with no strings attached.It\u2019s nice to go with a friend and have a buddy. Or is the point of having a guy so he can drive you?Right, but I can just take an Uber. That\u2019s the whole thing: dependent vs independent. Do I need a man? No, I don\u2019t need a man! What can he do for me? He\u2019s not even eating vegetables. Why am I stressing over guys that are still eating from the chicken spot? Like, no.You\u2019ve been vocal about the adversity and exhaustion often faced by Black women due to racism and misogyny. When you\u2019re in a particularly tough spot, how do you step away and recharge?That\u2019s a daily recharge. That\u2019s some shit I gotta charge like my iPhone. The way the world is set up, we have to make sure we do not beat up on ourselves. I need to make sure that I\u2019m treating myself like I would treat someone I want to love. I don\u2019t want people to think it\u2019s about spending money. Going and getting my nails done has always been something I love. But then I realized it needs to be from me. So now I like to take my time and do my own manicures and pedicures.Is there anything else you like to do when you need to unwind and just feel good?I just got a bathtub pillow: Oooh it's a life changer. Sometimes I\u2019m like, \u201cShayna get out, you can\u2019t sleep in here,\u201d because it\u2019s so comfortable. I like to do that with a bath bomb, my grapefruit candle, and ambient sounds on Spotify. Also everyone needs to get a jade roller. I only use it in the morning. It\u2019s been a week and I feel like I got botox or a face lift. I\u2019ve been looking at my face all week and I\u2019m like, \"Who is this woman?\" I feel like it\u2019s turning me into Angela Bassett.
