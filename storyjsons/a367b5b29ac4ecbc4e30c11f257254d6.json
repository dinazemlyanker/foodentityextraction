See our past recommendations here!Technically, everything you can cook in the Nagatani-en Mushi Nabe you can also make in a $5 metal steamer basket set inside a banged-up saucepan. But this is not a newsletter about pragmatic kitchenware, it's about beautiful splurge-y things for yourself and others (but mostly yourself). And considering I need only the barest of excuses to treat myself to $70 of California dates or a set of fancy ice cream dishes, here I am to tell you: You need this donabe.Elegant, durable, and outfitted with a removable steamer grate, this is the pot I can't wait to bust out when friends come over for dinner. As a steamer, it makes everyday sweet potatoes, broccolini, and asparagus all feel luxurious, like all my vegetables decided to take a day trip to the spa. Remove the steamer grate and the donabe becomes a gorgeous vessel for making hot pot, soups, or stews. True story: I once saw senior editor Amiel Stanek fill his donabe with warm bagna cauda and set it on a small rack arranged over a small candle, fondue-style. Dream big. \u2014Christina Chaey, associate editor at Bon Appetit.Buy it: Nagatani-en Mushi Nabe Donabe Steamer, $144.All products featured on Healthyish are independently selected by our editors.
