One whiff and it would seem the corrections and rehabilitation facility just north of San Francisco is full of amateur chefs.Determined to eat something other than the bland food they\u2019re served daily, incarcerated residents in prisons everywhere have found ways to cook for themselves using some makeshift cooking equipment and ingredients from the mess halls and commissary. The residents at San Quentin are no different, making apple pie crusts out of cake, tamales using crushed tortilla chips, and pasta with tomato-less marinara, all with little more than a plastic spoon and a hotpot (essentially a hot-water kettle, and the only piece of cooking equipment allowed in San Quentin).Since spring of 2018, a group of these cooks have been showcasing their inventive techniques and telling the stories behind their favorite dishes on the San Quentin Cooking Show. The project, organized by the first prison chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists, is part of a video journalism program with a rotating class of roughly 20 students. The show, which started as a simple way to teach the basics of video storytelling, has evolved over the years into a therapeutic space for incarcerated residents to open up about their backgrounds and reconnect with their own cultures while incarcerated.The show isn\u2019t yet available to watch outside the prison (though the ultimate goal is a YouTube channel), but four of the students I teach were willing to share an inside look at their dishes and the stories behind them. Here, they tell us about the recipes that remind them of life outside the prison walls.Juan Meza\nPhoto by Damien MaloneyJuan MezaBeing locked up, I miss a lot of celebrations con mi familia. The one I miss the most is making tamales on Christmas, a tradition shared by a lot of Chicanos like me. For many of us, it\u2019s the same scene. Familia gathers at a tia\u2019s house. The aroma of spicy shredded beef and pork wafts through the air. The sound of women\u2019s laughter and squealing children fills the kitchen as masa is spread across corn husks, a dollop of meat in the center, the little package rolled, sealed, and steamed. No men are allowed inside the house while the tamales are made. They\u2019re outside or in the garage keeping watch over two pots the size of small children filled with boiling water to steam the tamales. They play darts or horse shoe, cook, taste test, and drink cerveza.I didn\u2019t want to lose that tradition, so I found a way to make tamales for special occasions here in the joint. There\u2019s no local taqueria to buy masa de maiz, but I improvise using what I can get: tortilla chips, a hot pot, and a few plastic trash bags.Sharing the tamales gives us a sense of self, of community. It\u2019s a way we hold onto our roots, our family values, and humanity. It\u2019s a time to come together and enjoy what people enjoy most\u2014a meal made con amor.Meza\u2019s Christmas Tamale.\nPhoto by Damien MaloneyAll the ingredients that go into it.\nPhoto by Damien MaloneyHow Juan Makes His Christmas TamalesFill a hotpot with water and bring to a boil. Double two sets of small plastic trash bags, putting one inside the other, and then tie the bottom of each pair in a knot. Empty 2 pouches of Comal Carne De Cerdo Seasoned Pork into one set of the plastic bags, and season with 1\u00bd tbsp of crushed Milpas Dried Arbol Chili Pods, \u00bc cup of Hsin Tung Yang Fried Shallot Slices, \u00bd cup of Hsin Tung Yang Fried Garlic, 1 tbsp of Garlic powder, and El Pato Salsa Picante Chili Jalape\u00f1o and salt and pepper to taste. Empty 2 pouches of Rip \u2018N\u2019 Ready Shredded Beef with broth into the other set of plastic bags and season to taste with Tuong Fresh Hot Chili Garlic Sauce and Salsa Huichol Hot Sauce. Expel air from bags, tie a knot one quarter of the way from the top, and place one bag into hotpot and cook for 30 minutes. Repeat with the other bag.Tie the bottom of a large plastic bag into a tight knot. Crush 2 bags of Cactus Annie\u2019s Nacho Tortilla Chips until contents are small crumbs, and add to plastic bag. Add some hot water from the hotpot in small amounts, kneading the water into the crumbs until it forms a masa the texture of soft cookie dough. Open the bag, and using your hands, spread the masa into an 8\u201d x 16\u201d rectangle \u00bc -inch thick. Empty both bags of cooked meat into the center of masa. Roll masa around meat and form into one long cylinder. Let sit for 10 minutes until masa has settled.Rahsaan Thomas\nPhoto by Damien MaloneyRahsaan ThomasI\u2019m half Black and half Puerto Rican, but there\u2019s nothing I love more than Italian food\u2014especially marinara. Something about it thrills my tongue, and I adore the red sauce poured over chicken cutlets, meatballs, or any type of pasta. But at San Quentin, where I\u2019m serving a life sentence, the sauce I love is forbidden.In 2004, the year after I arrived, officials identified tomato-based products as a possible ingredient in Pruno\u2014a cell-made alcoholic drink. Due to incidents between drunk men and guards with anger management issues, the administration deemed ketchup and marinara sauce menaces and banned them both. The chow hall still serves spaghetti every so often, but it tastes and looks like punishment: Sticky pasta with dried sauce spots that are more like reddish tint than anything that was ever liquid. It\u2019s nothing like the dish I miss with all my heart.Determined not to go without, I scoured the catalogs of vendors that sell approved products to incarcerated people and figured out how to recreate Skillet Spaghetti, one of my favorite Italian meals to make before I arrived at San Quentin. In place of marinara I used a can of chile with no beans, and instead of a skillet I used a hotpot. (Forget about the jumbo shrimp I also used to add.)The result, while not quite the same as the original, is the next best thing. It costs me $19.70 to feed three people\u2014the equivalent of a month\u2019s salary in prison\u2014so I can\u2019t make it often. But it\u2019s worth it at least once every 90 days to treat myself to a dish that reminds me of home and everyone I love.Thomas\u2019 Hotpot Spaghetti.\nPhoto by Damien MaloneyHow Rahsaan Makes His Hotpot SpaghettiFill a hotpot to the 4-cup line and bring to a boil. Fill strainer with 1 package of Anatina Ziti Pasta, some Gold-n-Sweet whipped margerine spread (which I get from friends on a Kosher diet), and 3 pinches of Lawry\u2019s Garlic Salt with Parsley, and place in hotpot. Meanwhile, add 2 packages of sliced Midamar Halal Beef Summer Sausages and 2 pouches of Brushy Creek Chili No Beans into a small, clean plastic bag. Add (guestimate) 1 tablespoon each of Spice Classics\u2019 Italian Seasoning, Sevilla Saz\u00f3n con Culantro y Achiote, and McCormick Minced Garlic seasoning. If available, also add diced onions, bell peppers, and red peppers from the chow (i.e. mess hall). Once the pasta is tender, remove it from the hotpot and add to a large bowl. Squeeze in some Velveeta Sharp Cheddar Squeezable Cheese. Place the plastic bag with your chili sauce and sausage into the hotpot and cook for roughly 25 minutes. Remove from hotpot, pour over cooked pasta, and serve.Timothy Hicks\nPhoto by Damien MaloneyTimothy HicksBack when I was six or seven years old, I would watch my mother and grandmother cook. I learned a lot seeing them throw down in the kitchen together, and loved their cooking\u2014especially the sweet apple pies my mother would make every Christmas. The aroma of freshly cooked apples with the slightest hint of cinnamon and butter would permeate the entire house. I hated sharing them, they were so good. After my mother and grandmother passed away, I stopped having those pies. I\u2019ve had relationships with people who knew how to cook, but not like momma did. They would try to make her apple pies, but they would never compare.When I came to San Quentin in August 2015, I remember walking by a cell and catching an aroma that smelled exactly like my favorite dessert. I stopped dead in my tracks and peered through the bars of another guy\u2019s cell to find lunch boxes holding a square shape with a brown crust. When I found out he was making prison-style apple pies, I was blown away with excitement. I bought one\u2014it was delicious. Then I bought another to figure out how he made it.To recreate it, I got all the apples I could find along with clean trash bags, because that is what we use to cook our food in; some substitute sugar from the mess hall, because even though officials don\u2019t allow us to have real sugar anymore, we\u2019re smart enough to improvise; and whatever cake I could get from guys who didn\u2019t eat it for dinner. The seasonings and spices, I bought from the canteen. I had to get creative with my tools, and softened the apples by cooking them in a trash bag in the hotpot with some butter, cinnamon, and sugar. To toast my crust, I took a piece of square plastic, buttered it, laid some cake I\u2019d smashed into a thin layer on top of that, and then cooked on top of the water in the hotpot.It doesn\u2019t taste quite like the one momma used to make, but my Cake Crust Prison-Style Apple Pies still give hers a run for their money.Hicks\u2019 Cake Crust Prison-Style Apple Pies\nPhoto by Damien MaloneyHow Timothy Makes His Cake Crust Prison-Style Apple PiesHeat a hotpot full of water. Cut 4 apples into 1/4-inch squares. Add them to a plastic trash bag with about 4 tablespoons of cinnamon, 4 tablespoons of substitute sugars, and half a stick of butter. Knot the bag and add it to the hotpot; let cook for about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, smash the cake down into one layer. Butter a square piece of plastic and lay the cake crust down on top. Once apples are softened, remove them from the hotpot and set them aside. Place the buttered plastic with the cake crust on top of the water in the hotpot and let it cook until the crust hardens. Remove from hotpot and top with cooked apples. Add a second layer of smashed cake on top, and serve. Alternatively, you can also use cookies as a crust, and add peanut butter or jelly as a topping.John \u201cYahya\u201d Johnson\nPhoto by Damien MaloneyJohn \u201cYahya\u201d JohnsonOver the past 24 years that I\u2019ve been incarcerated, I have missed holidays and birthdays, monumental achievements like my son\u2019s many graduations and the birth of my granddaughter, as well as smaller, everyday special pleasures\u2014namely, my mom\u2019s cooking. Two decades later, I still find myself thinking about the rich smell of her Jiffy Blueberry muffins, fried chicken, and macaroni and cheese\u2014all the delectable things she made in her hot kitchen. I remember how much I adored her, knowing what a labor of love it was for her to feed her only child. Recreating my mother\u2019s dishes from inside my prison cell brings all my memories of her and her cooking to life.One of my favorite dishes to make is a version of her pepper steak and rice. I\u2019ve had to improvise, resulting in a creation all my own, but it\u2019s still deeply rooted in my mom\u2019s legacy. Instead of sirloin steak strips, a cut that\u2019s foreign to San Quentin State Prison, I use halal beef summer sausage sliced into quarter size pieces. And though I can buy brown gravy through the quarterly package program, I rarely do because I have fallen in love with curry. The rest is chopped onions, red or green bell peppers (whichever is available), yellow chile or sliced jalape\u00f1o peppers, shiitake mushrooms (my own addition), adobo seasoning, garlic powder, and chile powder. My version never turns out as delicious as hers, but it manages to help keep me connected to her, my family, my home.All the ingredients in Johnson\u2019s recipe.\nPHOTO BY DAMIEN MALONEYCurry Pepper Steak\nPhoto by Damien MaloneyHow John Makes His Curry Pepper SteakSlice one Halal Beef Summer Sausage into quarter inch slices and add into a pre-heated hotpot. Place a lid on top and cook for fifteen minutes, stirring periodically. After the sausage has browned, place one sliced red or green bell pepper, half of a sliced onion, six diced yellow chile peppers, and three dehydrated shiitake mushrooms broken into small pieces into the hotpot and cook for thirty minutes until vegetables are tender. Meanwhile, make gravy by mixing 1 tablespoon curry powder, 1/2 teaspoon adobo seasoning, 1/2 teaspoon garlic, \u00bd teaspoon chili powder, 1 tablespoon sriracha chile sauce, 1 packet of artificial sweetener, and 2 ounces of water in a bowl, stirring until contents are fully integrated. Add to pan with sausage and peppers, stir to mix, then allow to simmer for five minutes. Spoon over cooked rice, and serve.Recipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
