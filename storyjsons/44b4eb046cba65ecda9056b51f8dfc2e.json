It\u2019s exactly what it sounds like: seltzer with a heavy dash of bitters. But I like to think of it as a deeply aromatic adult soda, a nonalcoholic spritz for lovers of amaro, radicchio, and IPAs, as well as bitter converts like myself. Like many Americans, I haven\u2019t always appreciated bitterness, but as many non-Western cultures have long been aware, it\u2019s a beautifully rich taste in its own right, just as delightful as umami and sweetness.Hella Cocktail Co. cofounder Jomaree Pinkard and his team have been waiting for years for an audience that would appreciate their ready-made version of that familiar sober-curious drink. As he observed Western palettes shifting slowly toward this, and as more drinkers began flirting with low-ABV and nonalcoholic beverages, Pinkard and company finally decided to put these products on the market this summer. They tinkered with 67 different recipes until they arrived at these two versions: Dry Aromatic, a purely bitter seltzer with clove and woodsy flavors, and Spritz Aromatic, a sweeter version with a bit of sugar to complement the bitterness.The drink is strangely comforting in its complexity. You taste new flavors with each sip. More chamomile, perhaps a bit of orange peel, I\u2019ve noticed. \u201cPeople\u2019s palettes tend to pull out notes that are familiar to them,\u201d Pinkard told me over the phone. \u201cIf your grandma used cloves, you might pull that out of the drink. If you have memories of allspice growing up, maybe you\u2019ll notice that. Depending on where you are from or what you cook with, you\u2019ll have a different experience.\u201dThese days I find myself going through the Dry Aromatic Bitters & Soda like La Croix. It\u2019s wildly refreshing in the heat and revives me during the aeonian cycle of quarantine workdays. It\u2019s a complex and earthy addition to the seltzer market\u2014and to my fridge.Hella Cocktail Co.
