To add the words old-fashioned or traditional would be redundant\u2014because whereas ramen exists in a world of infinite variation, soba only ever dreams of being soba. And in that regard, Nunotsunesarashina is strictly by the books. The noodles are always fresh, and the dashi is always dense with umami. This is a shop where you get what you came for and expectations are exactly met. Though when the standards being measured against are as high as they are for soba in Japan, getting what you expect is a very good position to be in.ORDER THE: kamo-nanban soba for a bowl of hot soup and noodles topped with charred green onions and slices of duck. One special touch of this shop is that they give you a choice of thick or thin slices of meat, but the only right answer is thick. A bit of yuzu adds fragrance, and a dusting of sansho pepper gives the bowl spice and complexity.THE VIBE IS: classic, much like the food itself. The shop is dark and understated, a place for old men to eat lunch. Here, the long continuity of soba is, not just alive but thriving.PRACTICAL STUFF: Open Monday to Friday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. for lunch and 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. for dinner. Open Saturday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Closed on Sunday. The nearest subway stations are Tsukiji and Tsukijishijo.Photo by Xavier Girard Lacha\u00eeneThe shop decor is as classic as the noodles themselves.\nBy Kee Byung-keunExplore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
