It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.Summer isn\u2019t over yet, so make these recipesI walked into work last Tuesday, rested and refreshed, content that I had gotten the most out of summer. We sent our kid to camp for a month (which, despite some homesick letters from him demanding that we come pick him up, I like to think that it was a successful\u2026 growing experience). And I took off the last week of August, swam in the ocean, ate a lot of BLTs, grilled and grilled and grilled, and managed a few rounds of golf. I was ready for fall.Want this letter before it hits the website? Sign up for our newsletter!Then I wandered into the Union Square Greenmarket this past Saturday.  And, oh hey\u2014it\u2019s still summer! Go ahead, check your calendar. Lest we forget, the first day of fall isn\u2019t until September 22. And the market was still spilling over with ripe peaches, plump heirloom tomatoes, and piles of corn.That night, my wife and I had a bunch of family coming over for dinner. So we took advantage of the remaining bounty.Photo by Chelsie Craig, food styling by Anna BillingskogFirst up: a corn and peach salad, tossed with arugula, fresh mint and a shallot vinaigrette. When peaches are ripe and juicy, I like to think that they\u2019re interchangeable with tomatoes (also a fruit!)\u2014I use them in salads, Capreses, salsas, and even bruschetta. They\u2019re not just for dessert.Speaking of bruschetta, while my wife Simone was busy on the salad, I grilled up some slices of country bread. I roughly chopped up a bunch of heirloom tomatoes, doused them with extra virgin olive oil and a liberal amount of kosher salt, and then added some smashed garlic and torn basil. Then I just let them hang out on the counter for an hour. The longer the flavors have time to marry and the juices release from the tomatoes, the better. Piled the mixture onto slices of the garlic-rubbed, charred toast and, man oh man\u2014crazy good.Photo by Alex LauWith the leftover basil from the bruschetta, I\u2019ll make some of BA\u2019s Best Pesto tonight. And I certainly plan to whip up some no-cook tomato sauce with all those end-of-season heirlooms. I\u2019ve got 12 days of summer left\u2014I plan to enjoy every one them.Get the end-of-summer recipes:My Wife Simone\u2019s Shallot VinaigretteCaprese-ish Peach and Tomato Salad with BurrataBA\u2019s Best PestoPasta with No-Cook Tomato SauceGrilled Corn Salad (not the one I made, but a good corn salad)Explore Bon App\u00e9titAdam NewsletterRecipes you want to make.
