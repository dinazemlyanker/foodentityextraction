And Shy*Boyz Club Has Some Stories.Chefs Eric Sze and Lucas Sin both make Chinese beef noodle soup\u2014but they are nothing alike.By Meryl Rothstein and Jesse SparksSeptember 30, 2020FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Laura MurrayFacebookTwitterEmailThis article is part of our series on how restaurants changed in 2020, and why we've never loved them more. Click to see all the stories.At their NYC restaurants and joint pop-up, Shy*Boyz Club, chefs (and friends) Eric Sze of 886 and Lucas Sin of Junzi Kitchen cook as a way to explore Chinese food\u2019s past, present, and future and to celebrate the cuisine\u2019s diversity. \u201cChina has thousands of years of history, 50-something ethnic minorities, and one of the largest diasporas in the world,\u201d Sin says. \u201c\u2018Chinese food\u2019 could mean anything.\u201d Case in point: beef noodle soup, which varies in most every detail depending on who makes it.Photo by Emma Fishman, Illustration by Naomi OtsuThe Clear Choice\u201cClear brisket broth is near and dear to my heart; I ate it at least once a week as a kid in Hong Kong. I\u2019m a huge proponent of how subtle and elegant it is. My approach is in line with the style from Chaozhou, a city north of Hong Kong.\u201dRice Noodles Get It Done\u201cI use rice noodles\u2014they aren\u2019t extruded or pulled; they\u2019re cut, which means that the surface is very slippery. The Chinese word for it is hua, which is often translated as \u2018slippery\u2019 or \u2018silky.\u2019 They\u2019re really, really good for slurping, especially when you\u2019re slurping at high speeds.\u201dDig That Daikon\u201cIn Hong Kong daikon is the traditional vegetable. It\u2019s braised, and the sweetness of the daikon lends itself to the sweetness of the broth. It doesn\u2019t need sugar or soy sauce or anything to let it shine.\u201dShort Rib, Big Deal\u201cIn the U.S., we often think of brisket as one cut, but in Hong Kong, there are at least three, the best of which is called hang lam, which is basically boneless English short rib. It becomes fall-apart tender.\u201dPhoto by Emma Fishman, Illustration by Naomi OtsuRich Broth Is Boss\u201cI boil beef femur and shinbones, oxtail, and beef neck and add chicken bones for extra flavor, then add apple, celery, and an absurd amount of tomatoes. I toast spices like cinnamon and angelica root, and caramelize doubanjiang. Plus soy sauce for savory notes. If I had to trash-talk, I\u2019d say Lucas\u2019s Cantonese broth is very vanilla as opposed to flavorfully rich.\u201dWheat Wins\u201cI use wheat noodles because of the large number of Shandonese and Shanghainese immigrants who migrated to Taiwan after the Chinese civil war. That was their preference, and modern Taiwanese cooks obviously inherited their preference. Some things you just don\u2019t mess with.\u201dGreens With a Kick\u201cI stir-fry preserved mustard greens, a traditional Hakka condiment, in garlic, chile, and sugar. It\u2019s a brief but necessary break before you dive back in for more soup.\u201dGive Shanks\u201cAt my first restaurant I used short ribs\u2014it was a real show-offy dish. But as I got more homesick, I wanted to go more traditional. In Taiwan farmers would plow the fields while beef shanks simmered in broth at home. When they came back it was tender.\u201dExplore Bon App\u00e9titSoupBeefRestaurantsChefsRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
