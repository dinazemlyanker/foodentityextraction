When something\u2019s so easy to make you don\u2019t even need one. Welcome to It\u2019s That Simple, a column where we talk you through the process of preparing the dishes and drinks we can make with our eyes closed.I should have realized I was destined for a career in food when I found the most interesting part of my fancy-pants D.C. internship to be concocting different flavors of oatmeal in the office kitchen. Each morning, instead of getting ahead of my li\u2019l intern duties, I\u2019d hastily put my belongings down and peep into the kitchen fatefully adjacent to my desk. I marveled at the selection of free things: complimentary tea bags in every flavor Twinings and Lipton had to offer; cartons of milk (including nondairy\u2014score!); and, as mentioned, packets of instant oatmeal.\u201cHow can I use ALL the things?\u201d I asked myself, fanning the flames of the frugal fire that\u2019s been slow-burning within me for as long as I can remember. I emptied the powdery contents of a blueberry oatmeal packet into one of the communal Ikea bowls and topped it with glugs of almond milk. The wide assortment of tea bags called out to me. And this might be where your average officegoer, you know, makes a cup of tea. But even though I\u2019m not an avid tea drinker, I\u2019m also not one to pass up a free thing. So I plopped a sachet of Earl Grey into the bowl of wet oats and hoped for the best as it went for a spin in the microwave.The outcome tasted glorious: It was fragrant, novel (to my 19-year-old self, at least), and easy. Seven years later, I\u2019ve perfected the method. I often make this version inspired by doodh patti chai, a traditional South Asian\u2013style chai method in which the tea, spices, and milk boil together in a pot before getting strained into cups. Using this chai method as the foundation for my morning oatmeal seemed like a no-brainer, and the results were just as delicious as I\u2019d expected.Here\u2019s how to make it: Start by infusing the milk. Into a saucepan, measure out however much milk or dairy-free milk is needed for the amount of oats you\u2019re making (for a single serving, for example, you\u2019ll want 1 cup milk), then add an additional \u00bc cup. Add black tea bags\u2014one for each serving of oats\u2014and some whole chai spices, like crushed cardamom pods, a cinnamon stick, and star anise. (If you\u2019re hoping to make chai or chai-spiced dishes more often, you can also grab Spicewalla\u2019s chai masala\u20141 tsp. of that will do!) Add 1 Tbsp. brown sugar to the pot and bring to a vigorous boil over medium-high heat, then continue to cook for at least 3 minutes, until the milk is a deep shade of beige. (The longer you cook, the stronger the flavor.) It should look and smell like chai at this point.Give it a taste. If you like your oats on the sweeter side, add more brown sugar by the teaspoonful. If you\u2019d like an even stronger aroma of chai, add more chai spices or leave the tea bags in the pot while you cook your oats. Otherwise, remove the tea bags, then add the old-fashioned rolled oats and cook them according to the directions on the container. After the oats are done cooking, fish out the tea bags, if you left them in, and the whole spices. Top oatmeal with almonds, fresh sliced fruit, and a sprinkle of cinnamon.As delicious as this two-in-one chai oatmeal is, my original Earl Grey version will always have a special place in my heart. So if you have other flavors of black tea lying around, I highly recommend conducting oatmeal experiments with those too. If you find yourself obsessing over oatmeal in the office kitchenette to avoid doing your real work, however, maybe it\u2019s a sign to change careers\u2026And with the rest of your Earl Grey:Earl Grey Yogurt CakeA tea cake that's true to its name, this loaf harnesses the power of citrusy Earl Grey tea for its distinct flavor. Lemon poppyseed can't hold a candle.\u00a0View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titcookingIt's That SimpleRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
