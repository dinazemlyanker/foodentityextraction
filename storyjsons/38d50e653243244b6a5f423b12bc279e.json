Store-bought rolls that have been reheated, brushed with butter, and sprinkled with flaky salt might not be the same as homemade, but they will impress nonetheless.Ingredients8 servings14-lb. New York strip roast, preferably prime, untiedKosher salt, freshly ground pepper6garlic cloves, finely grated3Tbsp. finely chopped rosemary5Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil, divided\u00bdcup plain whole-milk Greek yogurt\u00bdcup sour cream2Tbsp. prepared horseradish\u00bdtsp. finely grated lemon zestWarm rolls and cornichons (for serving)PreparationStep 1Lightly score fat cap of roast, spacing cuts about \u00be\" apart, with a sharp knife, being careful not to slice into the flesh.

Followed the recipe and produced a tender, delicious roast.  Served with warm Kings Hawaiian rolls and the option of creamy horseradish or anjou.  Not a cheap cut of meat, but for a holiday/special occasion definitely worth it.  JoanCalistoga, CA12/20/2021Sooo, I have only tried this once but I would cook at 225F for 25 minutes per lb for blood rare, 30-35 minutes per lb for medium rare, and no recommendation for medium up. Otherwise, I love that it gives a thoroughly even doneness. Also, I might skip the wire rack as in my oven it reduces the heat to the underside cooking it less than the top.EzzymeSanta Barbara, CA12/26/2020OMG!!  This is literally one of the Top 5 beef dishes I have ever made.  Meltingly tender, sauce was sublime (use 3 tbsp horseradish and add cracked black pepper).AnonymousVirginia9/6/2020I'm going to try this, particularly the do-ahead. But I'm wondering if I could hold off on the outside crisping until after the roast came back to room temperature (1-2 hours) on party day. I believe it would make it much more delicious that way. \n\nAny thoughts as to why I shouldn't? Thanks!AnonymousChicago10/18/2019I've been using this technique for several years, and it works perfectly every time. The most essential tool is a good quality, remote-reading thermometer, preferably the kind with more than one zone. That takes all the guesswork out and assures terrific results. Using a low temperature method also makes cleanup much easier. No more burned on mess. An acidic sauce is the perfect foil to the richness of beef. I'll never go back to the conventional method of cooking meat.Anonymous12/29/2018I'm pretty shy about leaving reviews, but I knew I had to say something about this recipe. The meat is tender and super flavorful and i'm so glad we have leftovers to snack on. It was way easier to make than i thought it would be, and the payoff is huge! Probably the best thing I have ever made.AnonymousKansas12/28/2018Wonderful Party Recipe! I served this for a party of about 10 people, and had some leftovers. Served it with cornichons, arugula, red onions, and  horseradish sauce  to complete a make your own sandwich buffet. You shouldn't skimp on the rest time, so plan ahead. The roast also comes out on the rare side so keep that in mind if you want it a little more medium. It was wonderfully flavorful and juicy even when reheated for leftovers. lteutschNebraska 12/20/2018Incredible, surprisingly easy recipe. The butcher scored the fat for me, so I'm glad I asked. Do NOT forget the cornichons! Or some kind of pickle. You really need that acidic bite to balance out the fatty, rich beef. The garlic-rosemary rub is to die for; it filled my house with the most wonderful scent. When it came out of the oven, we picked off some of the rosemary and ate it plain, SO GOOD. alexbeggsBA.com 12/12/2018Explore Bon App\u00e9titBeefMeatEasyMainNut-FreeRoastDinnerRecipes you want to make.
