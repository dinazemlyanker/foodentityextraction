I got it in my head that if I never served these foods, this would not happen. I am here to tell you this backfired spectacularly. In not wanting to get sucked into a tater-tot-and-PB&J vortex, I inadvertently ended up depriving myself of, well, all my favorite childhood foods, which I still enjoy in periodic doses. I tried to fix this by introducing him and his younger sister to cheese-sauced elbows and crispy bite-size chicken, which were soundly rejected. What kind of children have to be talked into eating chicken tenders?Meanwhile, the \u201ckid food\u201d they love and request the most often\u2014grilled cheese sandwiches\u2014just happens to be the one I consider the least interesting: completely bland, with waxy insides and greasy outsides. So in our usual push-pull of family meals (me trying to nudge them to try new things that aren\u2019t so scary-new that they flee the table in protest), I started creating open-face vegetable melts: toasts piled high with chopped cooked vegetables, topped with cheese, and broiled until bubbly. I\u2019ve made these with garlicky broccoli and Parm and saute\u0301ed mushrooms with be\u0301chamel, but this spinach-artichoke-dip-inspired version is the only one we were still talking about a week later. They get their cheesy bread fix, while I can rest assured they eat some vegetables\u2014all in a grilled cheese sandwich I actually like.Get the recipe:Spinach and Artichoke MeltsYour favorite creamy dip\u2014but in a form you (and your kids) can happily eat for dinner.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titWeeknightCooking For KidsArtichokePicky Eaters\u2019 ClubRead MorecookingThis Garlic Bread Is the Secret to Converting Bean HatersBy Deb PerelmanRecipes you want to make.
