It's awesome on simple green salads. Ithaca, New York6/17/2020Just finishing my first jar - have loved it. I like more vinegar in mine (tend towards 1.5:1 oil to vinegar. And shallots were in mine, and taking it out of the fridge when cooking starts helps w the clumping.  I\u2019m also a fan of predressing it by putting it an a large bowl then adding and mixing the greens by hand (w gloves). dwilkinsboise2581Boise, ID5/9/2020\u00c9dit : no need to store in fridge (it\u2019s mostly oil). If you do, take out early enough for it to warm up. AnonymousFrance 5/5/2020All salad dressings are fair game and I like to play creative - but let me be my French self for this : a classic vinaigrette requires...\n- black pepper \n- no honey!\n- optional shallots (\u00ab\u00a0vinaigrette \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9chalote\u00a0\u00bb)\n- the secret twist : always add the oil last before final shaking. The vinegar must first welcome the salt, pepper and mustard to dissolve them well. Even more important if there are shallots (need to soak in the flavors). \nThere. I feel comforted in my Frenchness having corrected everyone :-D\nAnd thanks to America for the perfect vinaigrette shaker/storer/pourer (by OXO, in my opinion). Massive contribution. Pamela CaillensFRANCE 5/5/2020good basics, but needs an allium (gahlic, shallot, green onion, etc...)Anonymousboise4/3/2020to the commenter about the dressing clumping up in the fridge, Olive oil does not do well when refrigerated. (someone smarter than me needs to provide the reason or science behind that) try letting the vinaigrettes sit out for enough time to get it to room temp. I think it will help to re emulsify the dressing.    AnonymousCLE3/23/2020I liked this dressing and was quick to make. The only problem I had was it clumped after a few days in the fridge. Tried mixing it again, but it wouldn't mix...what did I do wrong?heather eatsMontreal2/29/2020I agree with comment about it not needing to be sweet but, as a variation, I prefer maple syrup to honey: it tastes more like you meant it to be sweet. Also, using a stick blender in the jar instead of shaking it creates an emulsion that holds, no matter what!elyssUK8/15/2019Pretty legit but no need to be sweet: the first thing I learned as an au pair in Paris in the 80's was this classic vinaigrette, minus the honey.  We made the dressing in the empty salad bowl, then added the salad and tossed right before dinner.Boston8/14/2019Wow, great vinaigrette. I've used it on salads, grilled veggies, over white rice and on pasta so far.
