The salt-and-sugar combo helps the pork chop quickly achieve a golden brown crust, and doing everything in the same skillet imparts a ton of flavor to the onion and radicchio as well.

Morton kosher salt, plus more1lb. 1\"-thick bone-in pork rib chops4Tbsp. grapeseed or vegetable oil, divided1small onion, thinly sliced crosswise, separated into rings1head of Treviso radicchio or other radicchio (12\u201314 oz.), coarsely chopped1lemon, halvedHoney (for drizzling)Flaky sea saltDijon mustard (for serving)PreparationStep 1Combine sugar and 2 tsp. Diamond Crystal or 1\u00bc tsp. Morton kosher salt in a small bowl. Lightly pound pork chops with a meat mallet, rolling pin, or the heel of your hand to \u00bd\" thick. Pat chops dry; season all over with salt mixture.Step 2Heat a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high 2 minutes. Add 3 Tbsp. oil, followed by pork chops. Cook chops, pressing down to ensure good contact with pan and turning every minute, until very well browned and charred in spots and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part registers 135\u00b0, 5\u20137 minutes. (Chops will still be a little pink inside; if you prefer yours well-done, cook another minute or two.) Transfer chops to a large plate and let rest 10 minutes.Step 3While the chops are resting, carefully pour off fat from skillet and wipe out any burnt bits. Heat remaining 1 Tbsp. oil in skillet over medium. Add onion and season with kosher salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until floppy and lightly browned, about 4 minutes. Working in batches, add radicchio, tossing and letting it wilt slightly before adding more; season with kosher salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until radicchio is wilted and tender with just a little bite in the thickest ribs, about 3 minutes. Squeeze in juice from a lemon half; toss to combine. Transfer radicchio mixture to a platter and drizzle a little honey over.Step 4To serve, carve meat away from pork chop bones and slice against the grain; arrange on platter alongside radicchio. Drizzle any accumulated juices over meat and season with sea salt. Serve with Dijon for dragging pork through and remaining lemon half for squeezing over.Reprinted from \u2018That Sounds So Good\u2019 by Carla Lalli Music. Copyright 2021 by Carla Lalli Music.

My husband doesn\u2019t like Dijon mustard but he liked the addition of it on the side because the flavors all worked so well together. Overall just well balanced and easy to make.
