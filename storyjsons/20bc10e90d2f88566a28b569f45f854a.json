White folks act like they invented food and like there is some weird mystique surrounding it.\u201d (Thanks to Samin Nosrat for sharing this.)This was 1970 but the words still hold true today. In the fifty years since, the predominantly white world of food media has not adequately acknowledged the Black community, without whom this country\u2019s food system would not exist. We, Bon App\u00e9it and Basically included, have much work to do.Since its inception, Basically has focused on recipes and cooking advice. But those recipes and that advice have not included nearly enough of the food, cooking wisdom, and voices of Black people, indigenous communities, and people of color. As Smart-Grosvenor goes on to write, \u201cThere is no mystique. Food is food! Everybody eats!\u201dSo why hasn\u2019t Basically reflected that? The site began as a staff-generated vertical, and given the racial makeup of our staff, that meant the content was often written from a white perspective and for a white audience.We as a staff have made a list of long- and short-term changes that we\u2019re committed to making. One of the most obvious\u2014and impactful\u2014actions on that list is to hire more staffers of color, particularly Black staffers, at BA and in the Test Kitchen. And as we hold ourselves accountable to that goal and more, I hope that establishing long-lasting relationships with more recipe developers and writers will help Basically become a more equitable place\u2014and a site that\u2019s more fun and informative to read and to cook from.Moving forward, there will be many more recipes from outside contributors as part of our effort to amplify and honor a wider range of flavors, ingredients, and dishes on the site. In that spirit, we\u2019re also changing how we source articles. We published a post last week about how to pitch articles for Basically, and my hope is that writers (or enthusiasts!) will send ideas for dishes, ingredients, and cooking techniques that they want to see, especially those that we haven\u2019t done a sufficient job of presenting in the past.The commitment we're making is forever, not just for now, and I\u2019m available (sarah_jampel@condenast.com) to field your concerns, questions, and ideas.Recipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works. Restaurant recommendations you trust.FacebookTwitterPinterestInstagramYouTubeMore from Bon App\u00e9titMastheadNewsletter SignupBon App\u00e9tit Media KitContactSubscription FAQsCareersRSS FeedsSite MapAccessibility HelpCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCond\u00e9 Nast SpotlightDo Not Sell My Personal Info\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
