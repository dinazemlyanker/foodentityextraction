I Love Ros\u00e9. Let\u2019s All Make Some Ros\u00e9 Sangria.And serve it with smashed cucumbers, tons of green summer herbs, and sparkling lemon soda.By Alex BeggsMay 8, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Chelsie Craig, Food Styling by Yekaterina BoytsovaFacebookTwitterEmailWhat\u2019s pink and green and not a J. Crew catalogue? This ros\u00e9 sangria. You thought you\u2019d get away from us this spring without a ros\u00e9 cocktail recipe, didn\u2019t you? Well I didn\u2019t. I will politely sit here while you complain about ros\u00e9, how over it you are, how corporate it\u2019s gotten, how much better a zippy Gr\u00fcner Veltliner is, yada yada. I know you love it. I know you\u2019re just saying that to be a contrarian. That kind of anger is for Twitter, not life. Let it go.But instead of going the fruit salad sangria route, all mushy orange slices and bitter blackberries, we went in more of a preppy spa water direction. I don\u2019t hate myself for writing that, because I tasted it and it\u2019s wonderful: slightly salty, bright and herbal, refreshing and crisp. It\u2019s pink, yes, but I don\u2019t judge a pitcher of booze by its color. And neither should you.The recipe: We\u2019ve got ros\u00e9, white vermouth (it plays up the cucumber and herbs because of the vermouth\u2019s botanicals), Persian cucumbers (more concentrated flavor, less mush than other types), a fistful of herbs (use your favorite, like basil + mint), and a sparkling soda topper like Limonata, Sprite, those Trader Joe\u2019s Italian sodas, or just use a bit of club soda and a squeeze of lemon.We love to smash.\nPhoto by Alex Lau, food styling by Judy Mancini.There\u2019s one step you can\u2019t skip. I know we talk about smashing cucumbers a lot here\u2014uh, we\u2019re sort of obsessed with it\u2014but it serves a purpose. It starts to release the juices of the cuke, and you\u2019ll get much more cucumber flavor than you would if you tossed some chopped wedges in there. Go this tiny extra step, people!While red and white wine sangrias can sit with the sugars of berries (and added sugar) and become close to syrupy, this sangria is lighter, and almost on the savory side. Can we even call it a sangria? Cucumber is a fruit! There\u2019s wine. Who\u2019s to say, really. It\u2019s somewhere on the road to a spritz, to be honest. But we have more important things to debate. For now, set your sights on the pool, a funny but not too braggy vacation auto-response, and a pitcher of ros\u00e9 sangria. It\u2019s quite chuggable, as sophisticated people with wide vocabularies would say.Get the recipe:Ros\u00e9 All Day SangriaWe like to think of this refreshing sangria as spa water but with a little buzz!View RecipeOr go with another pink drink\u2014they\u2019re all winners:Explore Bon App\u00e9titVermouthRoseCucumberCocktailRecipes you want to make.
