Here they get charred just until they\u2019ve slightly softened, then finely chopped and tossed with briny olives, herbs, vinegar, and olive oil to make an assertive sauce for pork chops (or halibut, cod, or steak).Ingredients4 Servings3small heads of broccoli (about 1\u00bd lb. total)2tsp. fennel seeds1\u00bdtsp. sugar21\"-thick bone-in pork rib chopsKosher salt2\u20133Tbsp. plus \u00bc cup extra-virgin olive oil1small garlic clove, finely grated\u00bdcup Castelvetrano olives, crushed, pitted, coarsely chopped\u00bccup finely chopped parsley2Tbsp. white wine vinegar1tsp. finely grated lemon zestFreshly ground black pepperSpecial equipmentA spice mill or mortar and pestlePreparationStep 1Trim 1\" from bottom of broccoli stems, then peel. Remove stalks from crowns; set crowns aside for another use. Cut stalks in half lengthwise and set aside.Step 2Finely grind fennel seeds in spice mill or with mortar and pestle. Transfer to a small bowl and mix in sugar.Step 3Season pork chops all over with salt, then rub with fennel mixture. Let sit at room temperature 30 minutes, or, if you have the time, chill overnight.Step 4Pour 2 Tbsp. oil in a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high. Cook pork chops, without moving around but pressing down with tongs to ensure meat is in direct contact with pan, until golden brown underneath, about 2 minutes. Turn pork chops over and cook until other side is golden brown, about 2 minutes. Continue to cook, turning about every minute or so, until chops are deep golden brown on both sides and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part registers 135\u00b0, 6\u20138 minutes. Transfer pork chops to a cutting board and let rest 10 minutes before serving. Reserve skillet.Step 5There should still be some oil in reserved skillet; if not, add 1 Tbsp. oil and place skillet over medium-high. Add broccoli stems and cook until lightly charred, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to a cutting board and let cool 3 minutes, then coarsely chop (about \u00bd\" pieces).Step 6Transfer broccoli pieces to a medium bowl and add garlic, olives, parsley, vinegar, lemon zest, and remaining \u00bc cup oil. Toss well to combine and season broccoli salsa verde with salt and pepper.Step 7To serve, carve pork chop meat away from bones, then slice meat against the grain \u00bd\" thick. Divide slices among plates and spoon some broccoli salsa verde on top.How would you rate Pork Chops With Broccoli Salsa Verde?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (1)Back to TopTriangleSomewhat confusing.\nDo you trim the 1\" cut off?\nTWAV8Rcoastal Alabama11/13/2021Explore Bon App\u00e9titPork ChopPorkMeatBroccoliVegetableWeeknight MealsMainNut-FreeDairy-FreeGluten-FreeKetoSaut\u00e9DinnerRecipes you want to make.
