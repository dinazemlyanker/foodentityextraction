Click here to read the whole guide\u2014then get those zzzs.I don\u2019t know any other insomniacs, or maybe I do. It\u2019s not something that comes up in casual conversation. We\u2019re private people to begin with, us not-sleepers, and our nighttime habits are the most private thing about us. So when I talk about my wakeful nights\u2014how they started and how I spend them\u2014I don\u2019t know if it sounds average or uncommon, a little quirky or totally bizarre.I used to be what people call a good sleeper. I slept through natural disasters. I slept through shrieking babies in the next room. Through college, I could sleep eight, nine, 10 hours in one go and had to stop signing up for classes in the after-lunch spot because of how often I\u2019d nap through them. Even at the most stressful times, sleep was simple, something I did as often as possible and with great pleasure.My transition to bad sleeper happened over the course of about nine months in my early twenties. I\u2019d spent the summer after grad school living in Alaska, renting a room from a divorced nurse who drank only St. Pauli Girl, \u201cwriting my thesis,\u201d biking six miles to the community pool to take hot showers, and watching movies on VHS. It was a time of low-lying but increasing anxiety. It was dawning on me that I needed to break up with my boyfriend, an actor 10 years older than me, and also that I wasn\u2019t going to be a successful writer by the time I finished my MFA as I\u2019d planned. It all seemed truly catastrophic...because I was 23.Back in New York that fall, I got a job at a high-end vegan restaurant, traversed the city tutoring prep-school kids, and nannied on the Upper East Side. I broke up with my boyfriend but still slept with him regularly. Among all that, I fretted about writing in both practical and existential ways. When would I have time to do it? What if I never finished anything? Why did I panic every time I sat down to try? I couldn't even read books because they reminded me of all the writers who\u2019d accomplished what I was sure I never would.I started waking up, almost always a few minutes after 2 a.m., with\nthe certain feeling that everything in my life was wrong.I was living in one of those sagging, impossible-to-clean brownstones in Brooklyn with five roommates. My room, on the third floor, was a converted nursery, just big enough for a bed wedged against a hissing radiator, a narrow desk, and a plastic rack of clothes. It was in that room, that fall, that I started waking up, almost always a few minutes after 2 a.m., with the certain feeling that everything in my life was wrong.I always think of the phrase \u201cfree-floating anxiety\u201d when I think of my insomnia, but that\u2019s not really a good description of what it\u2019s like. My anxiety doesn\u2019t float; it burrows into a spot in the back of my throat and sits there, immoveable, until something\u2014usually alcohol or a long, scalding hot shower or sleep if I\u2019m lucky\u2014manages to soothe it away. When I first started waking up, I\u2019d keep my eyes closed for hours, willing myself unconscious. I\u2019d lie there resolutely, anxiety building, until some gray morning hour when I\u2019d groggily surrender and get up. Soon my bed itself began to feel cursed; even the thought of being in it made the tension bloom in the back of my throat.One night, when I woke up at the usual 2:06 a.m., I got up. I went downstairs and made a cup of tea, then I sat on the couch, under a blanket in the dark. I turned on the TV and watched an episode of \"Say Yes to the Dress.\" Then I watched another episode. I got hungry so I made a bowl of oatmeal and ate it while watching a third episode. By that point, six women had found wedding dresses and were living happily ever after, and anxiety had loosened its grip on me. When the garbage trucks started heaving and whining outside the window, I washed my dishes, folded the blanket on the couch, went upstairs, and slept.This became my routine most nights: tea, oatmeal, shitty television. When I\u2019d seen every \u201cSay Yes to the Dress\u201d rerun, I switched to other innocuous, low-stakes shows. No \u201cLaw & Order\u201d; definitely \u201cHouse Hunters.\u201d Never \u201cThe X Files\u201d; always \u201cBarefoot Contessa.\u201d I grew up in a house with a strict TV policy, and my childhood training kept me from turning it on even now that I could watch 200+ channels any time (one of my roommates was a tyrant who insisted that we all split premium cable). But the rules were different in the middle of the night. My brain was at recess, and anything that helped me escape the monotony was fair game.I was definitely sleep-deprived, but my various jobs all started in the afternoons and evenings, so I could afford to sustain this pattern for days, sometimes weeks, at a time. But TV was only a temporary pacifier, and I soon got the urge to do something else at night, if not productive then at least distracting. I\u2019d read Just Kids, Patti Smith\u2019s memoir about her friendship with Robert Mapplethorpe in the \u201870s in New York, and it made me feel artsy and inspired by the city in a way I hadn\u2019t in a long time. I\u2019d gone to the Blick store across from the Chelsea Hotel and bought a cheap set of acrylic paints and brushes that stayed under my bed until the night that I decided to bring the set downstairs along with a pair of scissors, a stack of paper, and some glue. In about two hours, I made a little collage with paint and paper on a little 7\u201dx 7\u201d square of cardstock. The TV stayed on in the background so it never felt like I was working exactly, just idly cutting, gluing, and painting. I pretended I was fixing a small appliance or back at summer camp, dutifully doing arts and crafts.I moved through my day differently with the knowledge of what I did in\nthe middle of the night.I made dozens of middle-of-the-night collages and paintings over the next couple months. I kept them small because finishing one felt like an accomplishment that I could take with me back to bed. Over time, a strange thing happened: I started to look forward to waking up at night. Since moving to New York, I\u2019d become very bad at having fun. I went to school, I went to my jobs, I tried to write, I went to the gym. Occasionally I saw friends and went on OKCupid dates in an attempt to forget my ex-boyfriend. I\u2019d become a linear person, someone who looked toward the next task and the next, and I thought that\u2019s what adulthood was until insomnia came along and carved out a separate place. Being awake, truly awake, not lying in bed with my eyes scrunched closed, felt deviant. I hadn\u2019t asked for insomnia, but it seemed now like an offering. \u201cForget adulthood,\u201d it said. \u201cWatch bad TV and paint stuff.\u201dSomething interesting happens when you\u2019re making art with the same carelessness as watching television: It becomes less fraught, less terrifying. Sometimes it feels great, and other times it\u2019s boring, but quality stops being the point. I never had any illusion of quitting everything to become a collage artist. I\u2019d put my squares of cardstock on the desk I never used to let them dry before filing them away in a drawer. But I moved through my day differently with the knowledge of what I did in the middle of the night. It was one activity that no one condoned or enforced, and it was all mine.Gradually my insomnia-fueled painting gave way to little poems, which gave way to writing prose in fits and starts. The TV stayed on but I usually kept it on mute. As it got warmer, my bowl of oatmeal became frozen bananas smeared with nut butter. (I never knew until recently that all these are actually sleep-promoting foods.) Most of what I wrote was mindless, literally illegible to me now. But some made its way into my thesis, which was feeling more and more approachable when I looked at it during daylight hours. Sometimes I\u2019d go a couple weeks sleeping normally, and I\u2019d start to crave those middle-of-the-night times. These were the only hours that my adult brain would let my kid brain free to play. But I never had to worry because the insomnia would always return, and I\u2019d go back to my drawing, writing, snacking routine.Insomnia followed me even as I finished my thesis, stopped sleeping with my ex-boyfriend, vowed to quit writing forever, and left the city. It followed me as I fell in love again, slowly started writing again, and moved back to New York. At that point, I was working semi-normal hours as a factchecker, publishing regularly, and dating someone new. I had a little money to spend on indulgences: a dinner out, a new red dress, a bougie fitness class, a weekend upstate.This turned out to be the sleep aids I needed. As my day life got a little closer to my night life\u2014just slightly more hedonistic, a little less terrified\u2014I started sleeping more.It took a few more years for insomnia to loosen its grip on me, and I\u2019ll probably never be a \u201cgood sleeper\u201d again. I still have bouts of wakefulness, like when I have a deadline or something stressful on the horizon. I\u2019ve learned that I avoid high-stakes situations with such dedication and resolve that my brain\u2019s only choice is to sneak-attack in the middle of the night. (Case in point: It\u2019s 4:31 a.m. as I\u2019m writing this.) I\u2019ve come to terms with all that. In fact, I\u2019ve come to like that I\u2019m this way. It\u2019s the outcome of who I was in my twenties and who I fought to be: a writer, even if only between the hours of 2 and 6 a.m. If I\u2019d had bigger responsibilities\u2014a full-time job or a kid or a spouse\u2014I would\u2019ve handled my insomnia differently. Probably with pharmaceuticals, let's be honest. Instead I let it pull me out of bed and show me a version of myself, someone I\u2019m still trying to convince myself I can be.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishSleep WeekessayRead MoreLifestyleHow Sleep Became a Wellness FixationBy Ashley FettersRecipes you want to make.
