It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.A squash as big as the RitzA butternut squash the size of a bowling pin showed up on my table last week. I cradled it in my arms and cooed to it the only lullaby I remember, the Oscar Mayer wiener commercial. Then I rolled it into a 400\u00b0 oven (with a sheet of aluminum foil beneath to catch the ooze) and waited an hour, because there was no way I could cut that thing. I had dreams of butternut squash soup after a loud conversation at a bar with associate editor Christina Chaey about pure\u00e9d soups. While the squash slowly melted on the inside, I caramelized onions for the first time, a rewarding experience. Then I decided to wing it, inspired by Alex Delany\u2019s rent week lazy squash soup. When the squash was so soft my tongs broke the surface, I cut it open and scooped the seeds outs, then plopped the rest into my precious, my Vitamix. I added a spoonful of those onions, some salt, Aleppo pepper, water, and half a can of coconut milk. Whir, whir, whir. IT WAS GREAT. Coconut-butternut squash soup! I microwaved it at work and served it with some chile crisp on top. Everyone was jealous.Want this letter before it hits the website?

THAT\u2019S A LOT OF SOOP, BROTHER!Thin as spaghettiI have a personal obsession with the oldest people in the world, what they eat, drink, and do for fun. Then I try to replicate that in my own life. This story about Anthony Mancinelli, the world\u2019s oldest barber (he\u2019s 107!) didn\u2019t let me down. Mancinelli is still on his feet cutting hair every day, and he eats and drinks (whiskey sours, please) in moderation. He told the Times: \u201cI eat thin spaghetti, so I don\u2019t get fat.\u201d Nothing has ever made more sense.Pizza not-newsIn the viral food news that wasn\u2019t, this week people were like, \u201cWow Little Caesars is serving DiGiorno frozen pizzas as Hot-N-Readys!\u201d Based on a random person\u2019s tweeted photograph (circumstantial evidence). It was funny and slightly scandalous and ultimately untrue. For some reason a K-Mart manager needed to store expired frozen pizzas in the in-store Little Caesars freezer so customers wouldn\u2019t buy them and the whole thing has left me sort of deflated. I didn\u2019t know K-Mart had in-store Little Caesars. I didn\u2019t know frozen pizzas EXPIRED. I didn\u2019t know any of this would ever matter.Breathe fireWe wrote about three new recipes for garlic condiments you should probably make this weekend and use for the months ahead\u2014they can last a while. Creamy garlic confit (hello toast). Spicy garlic vinegar (on all the meats). Funky garlic honey (on pizza).Unnecessary food feud of the weekDo the flavors chocolate and orange ever belong together? We debated this over a box of Neuhaus chocolates this week that looked like smooth mini bowls of soup (sense a theme? Eh? eh?). I think they\u2019re supposed to look like cups of coffee. Anyway. One had dark Colombian chocolate, samba tea (huh), and little bits of orange. When I asked everyone how they feel about chocolate + orange they SOUNDED OFF. \u201cUm I can tell you NO NO NO NO\u201d said Chris Morocco doing his closest N*SYNC impression. Close. \u201cI think you start to appreciate it as you get older,\u201d said David Tamarkin, adding: \u201cLike WAY older.\u201d Aliza Abarbanel skips ahead to out-of-context-ville: \u201cEvery episode of The Great British Bake Off, someone makes a Jaffa Cake inspired thing and Mary Berry eats. it. Up.\u201d Emma Wartzman jumps in on the defense frontline: \u201cIna Garten\u2019s Orange Chocolate Chunk Cake is HONESTLY the best cake.\u201d Hilary Cadigan used to get a chocolate orange every year for Christmas and will not back down, she LOVES it. Sarah Jampel hates it. Amanda Shapiro will eat anything covered in chocolate. It really tore our family apart. But we always find our way back to common ground. Making fun of Alex Delany\u2019s ripped jeans.Explore Bon App\u00e9titBeggs NewsletterRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
