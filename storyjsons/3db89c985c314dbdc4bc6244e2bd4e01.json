I agree with whoever recommended skin-on thighs. And absolutely use broth, homemade made a huge difference. The caramelization part is still fuzzy to me..don\u2019t think I did that right and I think the amount of sugar is too much. I am going to try less sugar next time around. But I balanced it out with plenty of lime juice and sriracha - a hotter pepper would do the trick too. \n\nWould recommend adding vermicelli noodles, shiitake mushrooms, bok choy. Nothing else is really needed as I think this is meant to be a simple soup. Want to try adding miso next time too! Really delicious flavors!EEMSeattle8/27/2021I messed up the recipe, but it still turned out great! I undercooked the ginger, and despite trying to salvage it, the ginger was inedible. I strained the entire soup before adding shredded chicken back and it worked out just fine! As is, I think this recipe is perfect for sick days or a light meal. Anonymous10/18/2020This was delicious, with a few tweaks. Great ginger flavour. I used chicken broth instead of water, and also added celery, carrot, peas, and noodles. A squeeze of lime juice before serving. I liked this recipe because it used ingredients that I normally have on hand, and it's a good base for various combinations of veggies.canada4/27/2020This soup just got me through Covid-19. I doubled the ginger because I was trying to kill a virus, but damn I can\u2019t thank you enough. Super tasty!AnonymousPlaya del Carmen, Mexico3/30/2020I wish I could personally thank Curesti for the advice, caramelizing the ginger in chicken fat was ridiculously good. Kept the serrano peppers and added some fresh mystery mushrooms I picked up at my local Asian market. I\u2019m sick and needed some brothy comfort food and this did the trick. I can\u2019t taste all too well but my husband loves it. Stay healthy folks!Athens, GA3/14/2020Okay so here's the tea on this soup. I've made it about three times now and found a perfect process for this whole thing. So, get bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs for sure, it's necessary for a nice bodied soup. Now, instead of starting with caramel in your pot, start with a cold pot (dutch oven preferably) and place the thighs skin down. Turn the heat up medium high and leave the thighs alone to get a nice crisp outside and render a bit of fat. Take them out once you've got both sides browned and use the fat that's left over to help with caramel. I always thought caramel needed a fat to make it not just melted sugar but something rich. This way you'll also get a larger amount of caramel base and the soup won't just taste like chicken water and will have some depth to it. Once you get the caramel going, continue on with the recipe as instructed. I also added to pieces of lemongrass and subbed serrano pepper for the fresno chile cause I wasn't a fan. Also serve it with some fresh slices of pepper for extra heat to taste. Going to try and make this again tonight but with some added fresh turmeric for extra healing benefits!curestiAustin. TX12/8/2019This soup is AMAZING. We substituted 4 cups of chicken broth and 4 cups of water instead of the 8 cups of water that the recipe calls for. Also added some red chili flake for heat. This was so delicious and really easy to make. Highly recommend!AnonymousBoston11/6/2019I swapped out the Fresno for a dollop of gochujang! Was delish. :)lamojeruEvanston10/3/2019I am totally baffled by this recipe. I pulled it from the print magazine.  I bought skinless/boneless chicken as the recipe ingredients call for.  However, in the print version it states to 'discard skin and bones from chicken' which makes more sense.  Usually this is where a lot of the stock flavor comes from.  Also, I have never heard of a soup simmering for only 12 minutes.  Isn't it usually a couple hours so the flavor develops?   I made it exactly according to the directions and it was so lacking in flavor.  I feel like the directions were not edited/vetted correctly.  Do not recommend in its current iteration.jjfontanillaCalifornia4/9/2019Maybe BECAUSE I\u2019m sick this recipe feels like a miss for me? Husband is a fan. I agree with the comments that the amount of water to make the caramel in the beginning is problematic because it doesn\u2019t feel like enough to cover the bottom of the pan large enough to fit the rest of the ingredients later - which left me just making more caramel so I had enough to coat the ginger - the issue then is that it basically becomes caramel soup. I could use some guidance here! We ended up using chicken stock instead of water and adding lime juice and extra soy sauce but it still tastes too sweet for me. Love the idea of a ginger-heavy chicken soup but I feel that this one needs tweaking. danaantoniaPoughkeepsie, NY3/8/2019Loved this chicken soup! Definitely add 8 cups chicken stock instead of cold water. I also added carrots, celery, and egg noodles - very filling & tasty.Anonymous2/20/2019I followed the advice of the comments and actually used chicken bone broth instead of water. I also roasted sweet potatoes and poured the broth on top. It needed heat to me- I garnished with chili oil. SO good for a cold and rainy day. AnonymousSan Francisco1/8/2019Doubled the garlic, doubled the chiles, used stock instead of water and added chopped carrots and celery just after adding the chicken - result was the most flavourful quick chicken soup I've made in a while (don't skip the soy sauce and the fresh greens, they really balance out the sweetness of the caramelised ginger)AnonymousAustralia6/4/2018After reading the comments, I made this with chicken stock instead of water (would have made a homemade broth but I made it after work), and it was really fantastic. It definitely would have been too bland without the stock, but after that small adjustment, the ginger flavor was really special. This will become a favorite method from now on! I just realized I forgot to add the soy sauce, but I didn't miss it.Rochester4/30/2018I also found this recipe was lacking something.  Without stock of any kind it seemed to be kind of watery and lacking depth.  I added a lot of fish sauce at the end along with the soy but I agree that some mushrooms or other veg would help.  Also problematic was the caramelizing part. The scant amount of water and sugar didn't seem enough especially in the large pot I was using to accommodate the later 8 cups of water and soup ingredients. Good idea and turned out pretty ok but it needs some tweaking.
