I\u2019m not talking about 2020, the year that nearly broke the restaurant industry (and all of us). I\u2019m talking about 2021, the Not Yet New Normal. I still do that mental calculation with my mask at restaurants\u2014do I wear it at the table? On my way to the bathroom?\u2014and reading about restaurant openings (and closings) feels like whiplash. And yet it has also been a year of rebuilding, of hard work, of tough conversations, of big change. It flickered as a glimmer of hope in one of the world\u2019s darkest years.It didn\u2019t feel fair\u2014or logistically feasible\u2014to do our annual rundown of America\u2019s best new restaurants after such a weird year. So instead we\u2019re honoring the restaurants, people, and organizations that gave us hope, with a brand-new awards list: Heads of the Table. They are the ones that sprang up (or quickly recalibrated) in the pandemic to help their communities and others in the industry who needed it most. We\u2019re choosing these people and places not because they\u2019re making the best food (though we\u2019d argue that they are and we have recipes that prove it) but because they are giving opportunity to formerly incarcerated people, fighting for fair wages, and feeding their neighbors in personal and respectful ways. It\u2019s inspiring and exciting, and it gives me hope that 2022 will be a kinder, more equitable, more delicious, and much less weird year for restaurants\u2014and the rest of us. \u2014Elyse Inamine, restaurants editor2021\u2019s Heads of the Table:The Legislator: Francesca HongThe Guardian Angel: Restaurant Workers\u2019 Community FoundationThe Second Chance Supporter: Down North PizzaThe LGBTQ+ Hub: UrsulaThe Food Waste Hero: Sullivan Scrap KitchenThe Egalitarian: Reem\u2019s CaliforniaThe Local-est of the Local: Farm ClubThe Hospitality Hero: Lucille\u2019s and Lucille\u2019s 1913The Chinatown Champion: Send Chinatown LoveThe Back-of-House Advocate: No Us Without You LAThe Somm Savior: The United Sommeliers FoundationThe Better World Builder: The LEE InitiativePhoto by Adam HesterThe chef-turned-politician, legislating a more just economy in Madison, WisconsinAs the co-chef and co-owner of Morris Ramen in Madison, Wisconsin, I realized as soon as the pandemic hit that the government had failed the restaurant industry. There were no economic safety nets to catch us or others when our doors closed. Many of my fellow industry folks couldn\u2019t afford the rent anymore; federal support grants were an uncertainty; and making profit was incredibly difficult under stay-at-home orders. We were left largely to fend for ourselves. I knew that something had to change. So I ran for office as a state representative for the 76th district of the Wisconsin State Assembly last year. And I won. \u2014Francesca HongRead Francesca Hong\u2019s essay about how working in restaurants has shaped her agenda in office.Illustration by Jordan AwanA national nonprofit reforming the restaurant industry now and for the futureThe 2016 election led hospitality pro John deBary to think deeply about public policies that could adversely affect restaurant workers. So with his former colleague Alex Pemouli\u00e9, he founded the Restaurant Workers\u2019 Community Foundation, which distributes grants to a network of nonprofits aimed at resolving long-standing problems deeply ingrained within the restaurant industry, including mental health, racial injustice, gender inequity, and wage disparity.When statewide shut downs began in March 2020, RWCF raised over $7 million in COVID-19 crisis relief grants for individual restaurant workers and for restaurant operators through zero interest loans. And following last summer\u2019s racial justice movements, it formed the Racial Justice Fund in recognition of grassroots Black- and brown-run organizations already addressing industry-wide inequities. \u201cThis organization was founded by restaurant workers who really just wanted to make sure that the industry was hospitable for all,\u201d says RWCF\u2019s new executive director, Kiki Louya. \u2014Angela Burke, writer1 / 8ChevronChevronPhoto by Emma Fishman, Food Styling by Rebecca Jurkevich, Prop Styling by Sophie StrangioPhoto by Isa ZapataGiving formerly incarcerated people a chance to thrive in PhiladelphiaDown North Pizza is about dope food: Detroit-style pizza that\u2019s nostalgic and reminds people of Pizza Fridays as a kid. But it\u2019s also about training, hiring, and housing people like me. I am 35 years old and I have spent 12 years in the penitentiary. No one gives you a crash course into returning to society after that. What I\u2019m trying to do is create a place for our guys to be free, to be who they are. To have a good ol\u2019 time. Sometimes we dance on the line. We know that not everyone will get us, but not everyone comes from where we come from. \u2014Michael Carter, executive chef, as told to Elyse InamineRead about how Michael Carter\u2019s time in prison shaped his perspective on the justice system, and how he\u2019s found purpose in the Down North kitchen.Photo by Emma FishmanA safe haven and creative space in Brooklyn for the queer communityWhen Eric See closed the Awkward Scone in June 2020, he considered leaving New York entirely. \u201cI took a road trip with my dog to figure out my next moves,\u201d he recalls, \u201cbut when I came back to Brooklyn, I was buoyed by all the community-building I was seeing during a summer of protest.\u201d He had to stay.In need of cash, See did two pop-ups at Claire Sprouse\u2019s Hunky Dory\u2014but instead of focusing on the baked goods he was known for, See designed a menu closer to home. \u201cI decided to lean into my New Mexican heritage and serve Hatch chile burritos and sopapillas,\u201d See says. His pop-ups were a wild success and soon he was converting a small storefront into a permanent home for Ursula, a New Mexican caf\u00e9 named after his grandmother. Soon lines of breakfast burrito seekers were snaking down the sidewalk on any given morning.With buzz building around Ursula, See considered how to pay it forward. \u201cHunky Dory granted me an opportunity to launch a new business,\u201d explains See, \u201cand I wanted to do that for my queer community.\u201d Starting in February, See invited six LGBTQ+ chefs to stage a pop-up at Ursula, and he was adamant that the guest chefs keep whatever revenue they made since Sprouse did the same for him.The series launched with See\u2019s friend Woldy Reyes, who had lost much of his catering business during the pandemic. \u201cEric gave me a safe space to test out my concepts and share my food,\u201d Reyes says. Part of that safety stems from the fact that Ursula\u2019s staff is overwhelmingly queer. \u201cI\u2019ve worked in kitchens before that have been highly toxic\u2014transphobic, homophobic,\u201d says Hender Gonzales, who works as a sous-chef at Ursula and also participated in the pop-up series, showcasing the Peruvian street food of their youth. \u201cEric gave us space to dictate the kind of culture we want.\u201dWhat started as a six-chef series has become an ongoing project as word about Ursula\u2019s pop-ups spreads. \u201cUrsula is built on the idea of being in community, not just existing within a community,\u201d says See. \u201cOur queerness is rooted in mutual care and support, and we\u2019ll continue to be here for our queer and trans family as long as the need is there.\u201d \u2014MacKenzie Chung Fegan, senior commerce editorGet the Recipes:Picarones With Fig Chancaca Syrup\nTry eating just one of these picarones, doughnut-like Peruvian confections that are drenched in a fig-flavored syrup.\nPhoto by Emma FishmanEric See's Breakfast Burritos\nThis breakfast burrito recipe from Eric See requires shredded hash browns and New Mexico chiles.\nPhoto by Emma FishmanBibingka Waffles\nGlutinous rice flour gives these coconutty waffles (inspired by the Filipino cake bibingka) their delightfully chewy texture.\nPhoto by Emma FishmanPhoto by Justin WalkerA delicious way to fight food waste in DenverTerence Rogers wasn\u2019t always so scrappy. When he started his pop-up turned catering company TBD Foods in 2014, his focus was more on sourcing quality local ingredients than on using them up. But after an internship at Blue Hill at Stone Barns in Pocantico Hills, New York, where he worked with cooks from around the world and learned more about sustainability, his outlook changed. Realizing he could bolster both the environment and his bottom line by using every last bit of his ingredients, he started a weekly sandwich pop-up with leftovers from TBD Foods. His food got such rave reviews that he opened Sullivan Scrap Kitchen with co-owner Holly Adinoff (they\u2019re married) in Denver last summer. \u201cAt the end of the day, it\u2019s about reducing food waste, but it\u2019s also about adding more flavor to each dish,\u201d Rogers says. \u201cBy taking the time to extract more flavors, it helps out the environment and allows us to put out better food for our customers.\u201d Here he breaks down the leave-no-ingredient-behind ethos in one of his mainstay dishes: the seasonal gnocchi. \u2014Allyson Reedy, writerPhoto by Justin WalkerThe GnocchiRogers sources russet potatoes from Strohauer Farms, frying the skins for nachos and scooping the fluffy insides for gnocchi. He folds leftover or bruised herbs, like fall sage, into the dough for an extra layer of flavor.The Mushrooms\u201cWe wanted something substantial and hearty and rich without having meat in it,\u201d Rogers explains. Enter the \u2019shrooms, sourced from local purveyors Hazel Dell and Mile High Fungi, cold-smoked and seared hard to add a crispy element to the dish; they top the gnocchi, while the stems are thrown into risottos and veggie burgers.The PestoKale leaves may be the star of TBD Food\u2019s kale salad, but its hardy stems shine in this sauce. Rogers dehydrates and grinds them into a flavor-packed powder and also blanches them. Both are blended with roasted pumpkin seeds, confit garlic, olive oil, salt, and a splash of white balsamic vinegar for an unconventional but clever pesto.The Topping\u201cWe try to stay away from using microgreens. They\u2019re beautiful, but they go bad so fast,\u201d Rogers says. \u201cSo we grate just a little Pecorino Romano cheese and black pepper to finish it off.\u201d When the cheese is used up, its rind adds umami to soup, rice, and grits.Photo by Andria LoTurning restaurant employees into owners in the Bay AreaIn many ways the pandemic was divine intervention. It disrupted my business, so we had to change quickly to keep my employees working and the kitchen open. For years I had been dreaming about transforming my restaurant, Reem\u2019s California, into a worker-owned cooperative. When the pandemic hit I understood the time to change was now.My restaurant has always been about the people, from its employees to our neighbors to the local ecosystem of farmers and vendors. It\u2019s inspired by bakeries I visited in Syria and Lebanon; they were places of refuge for communities experiencing political disruption. But after I opened two locations of my restaurant, I realized I had become a \u201cboss\u201d in the restaurant industry. I was essentially the middle person between the forces of capitalism and workers struggling to survive.So I created Sumoud, a one-year apprentice program for workers at Reem\u2019s California, through a fellowship with Emerson Collective, an organization focused on social change. Sumoud is an Arabic word that means \u201csteadfast resilience,\u201d and is used to describe Palestinians in their struggle to survive and in their resistance to ongoing colonization and erasure. Through this program we bring our own knowledge and experiences of working in restaurants to unlearn the systems that have harmed us and reimagine the kind of industry we want to achieve. With input from community partners, we\u2019re figuring out what collective leadership, participatory governance, and shared ownership looks like in this new era. We\u2019re learning about business growth and self-care through the lens of justice, particularly language justice, which means everyone\u2019s voices and ideas are represented and respected. We have interpreters at all our meetings so people can fully express themselves in the language they feel most comfortable speaking. By next spring my hope is to sell Reem\u2019s to graduates of Sumoud, so they will become founding worker-owners of the restaurant. We hope that Sumoud serves as a catalyst for more restaurants to become worker-owned.The pandemic made me realize I didn\u2019t have to be alone in saving my restaurants. Partnering with my employees has allowed me to build a stronger foundation for the future. \u2014Reem Assil, chef and founder, as told to Nanette Deetz, writerCourtesy Farm ClubThe low-key delicious future of farm to table in Traverse City, MichiganTell you what business not many people are getting into these days: farming. Yet something about sustainability and permanent soil-stuck-in-fingernails drew Nic Theisen to it. He and his wife, Sara, own Loma Farm with restaurateurs Gary and Allison Jonas, and together they opened Farm Club last year (yes, that one) in Traverse City, Michigan. They built a restaurant-market-bakery-brewery that puts the region on the menu, a place for neighbors and tourists to eat the local-est of local food in a laid-back space against the beautiful backdrop of Leelanau County. All employees work a weekly farm shift to get to know the produce they serve\u2014and I hear they even like it. But what makes Farm Club so special is that it takes an arguably pretty bougie concept\u2014farm-to-table\u2014and makes it approachable, low-key, and familial. That means no tasting menu, no waiting list, no ingredients revealed from under a smoking cloche. We\u2019re sitting on a picnic table, looking out at some onion stalks, having a few cold beers while kids kick a soccer ball around. More of this, please. \u2014Alex Beggs, senior staff writerRead Alex Beggs\u2019s full report on the least pretentious farm-to-table restaurant you\u2019ve ever seen.Photo by Emma Fishman, Food Styling by Rebecca Jurkevich, Prop Styling by Sophie StrangioA Houston restaurant (and nonprofit) carrying on the family tradition of hospitality\u201cMaster of her craft and fearless entrepreneur.\u201d That\u2019s how chef Chris Williams describes his great-grandmother, Lucille B. Smith, a pillar of her community who was famed for her biscuits and generosity. The desire to be like Lucille is what powers Williams, his Houston restaurant Lucille\u2019s, and his nonprofit that arose out of the pandemic, Lucille\u2019s 1913. Editor in chief Dawn Davis talked to Williams about feeding his community in a personal way and how his restaurant group is growing.You were running a popular restaurant, serving refined Southern cuisine with global influences, when the pandemic hit. What did you do?We knew that a lot of restaurants were going to furlough their team. We kept 99 percent of our staff, but they didn\u2019t want to sit there and chill and get paid. So we started feeding first responders in our neighborhood using profits from the restaurant. The first 20 days or so, we did close to 3,000 meals. Our efforts were met with plenty of gratitude. Then we got the bug.You got the bug to serve your community, like your great-grandmother, which caught the eye of Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s and his nonprofit World Central Kitchen (WCK)?Exactly. WCK wanted to feed the community in Sunnyside, which is where a lot of my father\u2019s family lives. The volunteers were giving them Philly cheesesteak wraps, but they weren\u2019t interested. That gave me an idea: I\u2019d design my own menu for 30 days. I\u2019d make them meals that had dignity, meals that spoke directly to their palates. It was as if I were cooking for my own grandparents. WCK funded us for two weeks, and from there we grew organically.Once we started letting customers know that our restaurant profits went toward helping others, we started to see an uptick in business.Now that the pandemic has eased, what are you focused on now?I created Lucille\u2019s Hospitality Group, which includes my nonprofit, Lucille\u2019s 1913. For example, when we could only do outdoor dining in Texas, we offered our huge patio to different bars. They took over our outdoor space, and 100% of the sales (minus taxes and liquor costs) went directly to those bars. We put close to $53,000 directly in their pockets. We ate all the costs, but we were thinking about sustainability and how we can help others\u2014not making a profit.We\u2019ve also started a fermentation lab where we make deconstructed chowchow with cabbage, green tomatoes, and carrots. At the lab, we employ refugees from around the world and teach them culinary skills. And we still do meal distribution on our own and with other organizations such as Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s partnership with Bread of Life.Our one-year anniversary for the nonprofit was on August 27, which was also our ninth anniversary for the restaurant. We\u2019ve come full circle.Make Chris Williams\u2019s roast chicken with root vegetables, an homage to how his great-grandmother tirelessly fed her community, and a reflection of his restaurant Lucille\u2019s.Photo by Isa ZapataPhoto by Isa ZapataMaking Chinatown more resilient in New York City\u201cWe\u2019re focused on mom-and-pop merchants in Chinatown that are being forgotten,\u201d says Justin McKibben, founder of Send Chinatown Love, a volunteer-run organization that\u2019s helping businesses in NYC\u2019s Chinatowns get back on their feet. Many of these places didn\u2019t have big social media followings, let alone a functioning website. As the world eased into digital living early in the pandemic, they struggled to stay afloat. McKibben asked friends on Instagram if they wanted to help, and began a concerted effort to not just fundraise for these Chinatown businesses but to strengthen them through consulting on business development, such as creating websites and onboarding them onto food delivery apps. So far, their 50-person-plus team has helped 26 restaurants (and other Chinatown businesses) keep their doors open. \u201cThey combine their knowledge they have about social media and understanding of English with love and empathy for the community,\u201d says Ruth Li, the co-owner of BocBoc Chicken Delicious in Elmhurst, Queens. \u201cThat is very powerful.\u201d \u2014E.I.Hear more from Ruth Li about how Send Chinatown Love helped her business survive.Photo by Dondre StuetleyPutting back-of-house workers firstIn the beginning of the pandemic, all the restaurant GoFundMes were focused on helping front-of-house workers, but not many people were helping workers in back-of-the-house, especially those who were undocumented, who receive no help from the government. They\u2019ve given their lives to the industry, and we felt that we had a social responsibility to help them. We\u2019re going on our 19th month in operation. We\u2019ve been feeding over 1,600 families in Los Angeles, primarily back-of-house workers. We move 160,000 pounds of food every week, paid for by individual donors and foundation grants or donated. We\u2019re going to keep doing this for as long as we can. We\u2019re nothing without our people. \u2014Oth\u00f3n Nolasco and Dami\u00e1n Diaz, founders of No Us Without You LA, as told to Esther Tseng, writerIllustration by Jordan AwanSupporting and strengthening wine professionals across the countryChris Blanchard, treasurer and cofounder of the United Sommeliers Foundation (USF) and Northwest regional manager of Opus One Winery in Oakville, CA: On March 17, I received two phone calls from friends\u2014sommeliers panicked about just being laid off. I texted Cristie and said, \u201cWe need to help our community.\u201dCristie Norman, USF president and cofounder and lead sommelier at Delilah in Las Vegas: I told him we should start a GoFundMe page, and we immediately began calling wineries, as well as other industry connections. We had no idea that this would snowball into The United Sommeliers Foundation.Blanchard: With vice president Erik Segelbaum and secretary Jon McDaniel, our mission is to provide a support network for the sommelier community. The sommelier is the first to get laid off when money is tight\u2014and the last to get hired back. We wanted to provide cash to out-of-work sommeliers to pay for medical bills, rent, gas, groceries, and other basic needs.Norman: Raising $1 million seemed like something unattainable when we first set up USF.Blanchard: But we reached that goal a year after our inception. We\u2019ve been able to help more than 1,000 sommeliers so far with these funds. This organization will be here for the long term; in April we filed for 501(c)(3) status. Our goal for the future is to continue to provide assistance to restaurant wine workers while also giving them career advice and acting as a spokesperson for them so others can understand just how important their work is. They play a key role in a restaurant: They write schedules, handle opening and closing, clear plates, wash dishes, anything that a restaurant needs. It\u2019s been so rewarding. So many folks sent us notes. To help even a little bit is so beautiful and fulfilling. \u2014Interview by Elsie Yang, writerPhoto by Isa ZapataSupporting restaurants, farms, and the next generation in Louisville, KentuckyEdward Lee is the chef-owner of Louisville restaurant 610 Magnolia, and Lindsey Ofcacek is the restaurant\u2019s wine director. The pair had a clear focus when they started The LEE Initiative in November 2017: to connect Kentucky women early in their restaurant careers with established chefs, with the hope of elevating them to future leadership positions. But when the pandemic hit, they immediately expanded its scope. \u201cChef and I realized really quickly that we had all of these people who work here at 610 Magnolia and all of this food,\u201d Ofcacek said.
