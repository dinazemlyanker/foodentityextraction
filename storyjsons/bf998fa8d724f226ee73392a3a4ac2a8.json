Whether you\u2019re taking a day trip to the closest beach, or spending 11 hours in an un-air-conditioned van with your family\u2014well, we\u2019ve got your road trip snack horoscope to help you reach your destination. That\u2019s right: a snack for every sign of the hungry Zodiac. Buckle your seatbelt and read your August horoscope, below.Illustration by Arabella SimpsonAriesYou live for fun. So much so that you\u2019ve been meeting friends every night of the week for trivia, bowling, happy hour\u2026but there is the risk of \u201ctoo much of a good thing\u201d because now you suddenly feel busy. You\u2019re craving a week of total freedom to be/say/do whatever you want. Clear your schedule (and your head) by taking a road trip. By the time you\u2019re ready to come home, you\u2019ll know which social commitments you haven\u2019t missed and can let go of. In your eagerness to leave the house, don\u2019t forget your phone charger\u2014oh, and snacks! Stop at a mega-gas station and make a mad dash for those glowing, ageless rotisserie hot dogs. Quick, satisfying, no fuss, fun-on-a-bun, just like you.Illustration by Arabella SimpsonTaurusYou\u2019re really trying to meet your career goals this month, but you might need to adjust your workload to make sure the assignments you take on are ones that challenge you positively. It\u2019s okay for you to be picky right now, and it\u2019s okay for you to change your mind (we know this is hard for you, loyal Taurus!). What else can you do to reignite your excitement for your job? Burn one of those vacation days and take that hike everyone\u2019s been telling you about. To fuel up on the road trip there, score a pack of honey roasted peanuts, which are sweet and dependable (like you!). The tube-shaped bag is ideal for dumping the salt and sugar at the bottom into your mouth, because you, Taurus, can do anything you put your mind to.Illustration by Arabella SimpsonGeminiYou\u2019re trying to clear your mind of the clutter these days. Filter, Gemini, filter. You\u2019re an insatiable reader, but take a break from your beloved memes and stock up on info that can serve you long term. Plan a road trip to the National Park that\u2019s been calling your name and download enough podcasts (cough cough) to get you there. When you stop the car to stretch your legs (and maybe do some chaturangas), hit up a local fruit stand for some fresh-picked apples and off-the-vine grapes, the kind of pure juicy realness you crave after too much time in social media\u2019s fictions.Illustration by Arabella SimpsonCancerThis August is about figuring out what is most important to you in terms of how you spend your time and money. Where are you invested? Is it paying off? Now\u2019s the time to check in and make sure you aren\u2019t wasting your talent and energy on a project going nowhere. So maybe it\u2019s time to go somewhere. Skip out of town for a long weekend, rent an Airbnb in a neighboring city, and explore...it\u2019s okay to not have a plan! Especially when you packed literally everything you could possibly need: 5 pairs of shoes, waterproof bandaids, sewing kit, and a cooler packed with homemade PB&Js, cut on the diagonal, of course. The perfect snack for someone who\u2019s always prepared.Illustration by Arabella SimpsonLeoRelationships are wonderful and all, but reading someone else\u2019s mind can be very frustrating. Whether you're trying to understand something your S.O. wants, or trying to crack the code of these weird Tinder social norms, this month is going to have some communication blockages. Leo is known for generosity, so we know you\u2019ll be able to offer this person plenty of warmth to break the ice, and why not a spontaneous road trip? As for snacks, you\u2019re packing Combos, the winning harmonization of pretzel and flavorful cheddary filling\u2014an ideal synergy of two personalities that complement each other juuuust right. (cheesy, we know) but you may even score some points for that.Processed with VSCO with c1 presetIllustration by Arabella SimpsonVirgoIt\u2019s easy to get so narrowed in on one thing that you lose focus on everything else. Are you trying to pack too much into one day, leaving yourself too exhausted to even brush your teeth before bed? Take charge of your routine this month by making a schedule and sticking to it (11:00 p.m.: brush teeth). Pencil in a camping weekend, and mix up some Puppy Chow for the road trip, always a crowd pleaser (like someone we know). You\u2019ll know you\u2019re doing it right if there\u2019s chocolate and powdered sugar everywhere. But knowing you, there\u2019s a stash of wet wipes packed too. Good looking out Virgo, we can always leave it to you to be both crafty and detailed.Illustration by Arabella SimpsonLibraFind more excuses to create and play this month. Buy a coloring book for the hell of it, or give in to spontaneous Thursday night dance parties in the living room. Your friends might be a little extra this month (cue the drama), but as always, you can handle it. At least one friend will have some big news to share, while another friend might need you to lend an ear. Reconnect with your closest crew and hit the road, and don\u2019t forget a bag of Trader Joe\u2019s Simply the Best Trek Mix. For someone who can\u2019t decide between chocolate, dried fruit, and all of the nuts, (that\u2019s you, Libra) feel free to pick and choose your next bite, and go ahead, take that as a metaphor.Illustration by Arabella SimpsonScorpioYou\u2019ve got a secret you\u2019ve been keeping under wraps; something is going on behind the scenes that\u2019s causing quite a stir! (Maybe you think you\u2019ll jinx it if you speak too soon?) Whether you\u2019re moving, planning a major renovation, or uprooting yourself altogether to join the circus, one chapter is about to conclude in your life while a new and exciting one is underway. Stay focused and keep your stamina up by stocking up on beef jerky for your next road trip. The smoky snack can hold up in a long trip\u2014and help you endure the interrogation from friends and family trying to fish out your secret. Persistence, Scorpio. Good things are coming!Illustration by Arabella SimpsonSagittariusIf you haven\u2019t had a week-long getaway this summer, now\u2019s the time. And boy do you need it! You\u2019ll have good luck returning to a place you\u2019ve already visited, which can offer you both rest and the adventure you crave. Nothing like a packed car and the open road to make you feel like a kid on summer break again. The journey is half the fun! You love buttons, and you love games, so hit up the vending machines at the next rest stop and press B14 for those mini cans of Pringles. They\u2019re fun to eat and the handy storage tube may prove to be useful later\u2014you\u2019re always the one to see the possibilities with literally anything, which is why we like road tripping with you.Illustration by Arabella SimpsonCapricornYou\u2019re resourceful, capable, and independent, which means you insist on doing everything yourself. But this month you might feel like you\u2019re out on a limb. Trust becomes a theme for you this month, so go ahead and ask for help, Capricorn. It\u2019s okay to let go a little. And sometimes ya gotta spend money to make money. In the meantime, get some zen time for yourself by planning a weekend escape to the nearest hot springs. You\u2019re a no-B.S. kinda person, so bring Gardetto\u2019s along for the ride\u2014no frills, no fancy packaging, just straight-up salty, crunchy deliciousness. Make sure not to eat all the rye chips at once.Illustration by Arabella SimpsonAquariusYou\u2019ve spent a considerable amount of time lately analyzing what you want out of life. Well, sorta. You\u2019re still deciding. But at least you know what you don\u2019t want. Call on your favorite people to be your trusted soundboard. Bounce your ideas of of them and welcome their feedback. You never know where it could lead! Maybe a spontaneous road trip is in order (good ideas happen around smoldering campfires). Definitely pull over on the way to score a Dairy Queen Blizzard, the scientifically perfect balance of ice cream and added candy, which is important for someone who appreciates facts. Turn it upside-down to marvel at how substantial it is. Yes. There\u2019s not much you\u2019ll get emotional about, but this is one treat you\u2019ll go crazy for.Illustration by Arabella SimpsonPiscesYou\u2019re usually happy to help, but sometimes people depend on you a little too much, especially when it comes to work stuff this month. Everyone else has confidence in you, so you should too! August offers you a chance to step into even more of a leadership role, so recognize that you\u2019ve got the experience and you\u2019re a freakin BOSS. Make your feelings known (strategically) and maybe get that advancement you deserve. Get a head start on those extra vacation days and take a road trip to the nearest amusement park. On your way, munch on popcorn sprinkled with nutritional yeast\u2014it tastes just like cheese, except it\u2019s\u2026 healthier? You\u2019re down, because there\u2019s no snack frontier you won\u2019t explore. Stay weird, Pisces.Catherine Urban is an astrologer, writer and nutritional yeast enthusiast.
