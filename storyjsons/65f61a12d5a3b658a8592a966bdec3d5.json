The woman behind the list did a lot of work.By Adam RapoportSeptember 24, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Emma FishmanFacebookTwitterEmailA few weeks ago, I was wandering around the Bon App offices, swinging a 9-iron\u2014my version of a fidget spinner. As is often the case, the last thing I wanted to be doing was sitting in one of those meshy Aeron chairs, staring at my laptop.So I dipped my head into Julia Kramer\u2019s office. Julia, of course, was doing just that\u2014glued to her computer, cup of Pret A Manger lentil soup in hand, a stack of article printouts nearby, and next to them, a teetering pile of cookbook galleys that she would \u201ctotally get to\u201d one of these weeks.If you think the life of a restaurant critic is glamorous, you should drop in on Julia. At a time when we are all being asked to do more and more (that\u2019s not just a publishing-industry thing, right?), Kramer is the one at BA who I\u2019m always urging to do less.As the brain (and belly) behind this year\u2019s Hot 10\u2014our annual list of America\u2019s Best New Restaurants\u2014Kramer is Bon App\u2019s chief restaurant critic.But she\u2019s also our deputy editor. Which means she edits every word of every issue and lays eyes on nearly every piece of content that goes up on bonappetit.com. And because that\u2019s not enough, she also writes copy for our new online store, shop.bonappetit.com. (On the tie-dye shirts: \u201cWhich is the safest bet: taking that ayahuasca trip, going to a Dead & Co. concert, or buying this T-shirt? We\u2019re gonna go with that last option.\u201d) And when there is a going-away party, she\u2019s our Bob Dylan, drafting sing-along lyrics for departing colleagues.It\u2019s this all-you-can-eat work ethic that Julia relies on while traveling to more than 200 restaurants in 30 cities during her search for her 10 favorite restaurants of 2019. It\u2019s a multi-month grind where the phrase \u201cthird dinner\u201d is not uncommon, and a satellite membership to CorePower Yoga is invaluable.This is the first year with Julia running point on the Hot 10 after five years of riding shotgun with Andrew Knowlton. By now she knows enough not to think of this as a solo show. Amiel Stanek selected and wrote up two of the 10 restaurants. Photographer Alex Lau and creative director Michele Outland barn-stormed the country to shoot nearly all the award winners. And then there is the entire team back in New York, who assembles the issue, builds the digital experience, and plans the Hot 10 party, a massive come-one-come-all bash in Brooklyn on October 19 (which, for the record, you can and should buy tickets for here).Oh, and one more thing. Julia was pregnant while she did her research, which marks the second time in her hunt for the Hot 10 that she has crisscrossed the country eating for two. \u201cJust think of how much money I saved BA,\u201d she likes to point out, \u201cby not sampling all those cocktail and wine lists.\u201dWell, that\u2019s one way of looking at it. Another way is that for the next four months, we won\u2019t have Julia to lean on to do pretty much everything. We\u2019ll just have to pick up the slack\u2014if not the lentil soup.You can buy your ticket to the Hot 10 party right here!Explore Bon App\u00e9titAdam NewsletterHot 10 2019Read MorerestaurantsThe Hot 10: America's Best New Restaurants 2019By Julia KramerLifestyleThree Months, 200 Meals, and a LOT of Time on the RoadBy Amanda ShapirorestaurantsOur 50 Nominees for the Hot 10: America\u2019s Best New Restaurants 2019By The Bon App\u00e9tit StaffrestaurantsEverything I Know About Running Restaurants, I Learned From My MomBy Donny Sirisavath, as told to Hilary CadiganRecipes you want to make.
