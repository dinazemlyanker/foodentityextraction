It was all creamy soft-scrambled eggs and oozing ricotta on \u201csalty AF\u201d focaccia, per Molly\u2014a truly delicious mess. To pay homage to the gone-but-not-forgotten sandwich, she developed a recipe that nods to it, while adding a few other elements that make it something \ud83c\udd95.Your base: FocacciaSelf-explanatory. Spongy. Salty. Airy.Layer one: RicottaTangy-creamy ricotta is near perfect already, but Molly adds a few cranks of shredded Parmesan to give it salty depth and a touch of funk. Oh, and some lemon zest and grated garlic for bonus points. (This is your microplane\u2019s time to shine, people!) Think of the (best) sauce on a white pizza, it\u2019s kind of like that.Layer two: Soft-scrambled eggsLow heat, custardy curds of eggs are what we\u2019re going for. Like Saltie\u2019s version. The soft fluffy eggs end up a similar texture to the ricotta, so they mix together harmoniously.

The bulbs get saut\u00e9ed in butter before adding the greens with white wine vinegar and water, which will soak into the onions and turn them soft and jammy* (yes this is our favorite word lately). They end up sweet but acidic, with a nice spicy bite to stand up to the egg-ricotta business. Finally, we construct the sandwich open-faced to make it easier to shovel into your mouth.
