If you sign up for our newsletter, you\u2019ll get her letter before everyone else.Have you seen the documentary Gather? It\u2019s a beautiful film about food sovereignty\u2014the right to healthy, culturally appropriate food produced sustainably\u2014among Indigenous communities, directed by Sanjay Rawal. I was honored to moderate a discussion between Rawal and ethnobotanist and food sovereignty activist Linda Black Elk last night hosted virtually by the Museum of Food and Drink. I learned so much from watching the documentary (available now on Amazon or iTunes) and from talking to these brilliant folks, and I wanted to share some of my takeaways from the conversation.To be a good ally and a good citizen of the land, do your research. \u201cOne of the greatest things that people can do is know where your food came from,\u201d says Black Elk, using Thanksgiving as an example. \u201cThe food that everyone\u2019s going to be eating soon, where does the majority of that food come from? Corn, potatoes\u2014potatoes are not Irish, they are indigenous. Corn is an indigenous food as well. Chocolate, pumpkins and squashes, turkeys. Know where they come from, and know about the people who have sacrificed so much to bring those foods to the world.\u201dWant this letter before it hits the website?\u00a0Sign up for our newsletter!If you\u2019re going to eat indigenous foods or medicines, source them from Indigenous people. This is a good way to support Indigenous producers and communities, who know how to sustainably harvest their food sources, instead of taking something that they may need. Consider California white sage, which Black Elk points out has been appropriated and exploited\u2014white sage is poached or commercially harvested and sold for profit by non-Natives looking to capitalize on wellness trends, leaving it difficult for Indigenous communities to access what they need. \u201cIf you are getting that from an Indigenous person, absolutely take it and use that in a good way,\u201d she says. \u201cBut don\u2019t buy it from a major chain or a convenience store where it comes in a little shell.\u201dThe pandemic has exposed the terrible cost of divorcing Indigenous people from their food systems. Native Americans are four times as likely to be hospitalized due to COVID-19 than non-Hispanic white people, and Black Elk says that goes back to food. \u201cIt goes back to eating all of these colonized foods for so long that has caused these incredible rates of diabetes, heart disease, and asthma. Those are the risk factors for complications and death from covid, so it\u2019s this vicious cycle that\u2019s often due to this lack of food sovereignty.\u201dSince the pandemic started, Black Elk says, \u201cThere have been so many deaths of fluent speakers, of elders, of people who hold knowledge about food, and language, and medicine,\u201d and that it\u2019s important to prioritize passing that knowledge around. \u201cWhen the pandemic got really serious here, we started drying meat. We started teaching people, whether they were Indigenous and not, how to save food, how to preserve food if you don\u2019t have electricity.\u201dIn Gather, forager Twila Cassadore hunts pack rats.\nPhoto by Renan OzturkUnderstand how food sovereignty applies to you. Rawal says, \u201cFood sovereignty in non-Native communities means understanding who the producers of our food are, understanding that our support needs to go to them, and that it\u2019s important to make sure we know our farmers, know our grocers, know how they treat their workers. Know that you might need to pay a little more to ensure that they remain. The tighter the community is, the stronger and more resilient our local food systems will be.\u201dThink about who is telling the stories. Black Elk and Rawal agree that there is a difference between telling Native stories and giving people space to tell their Native stories. \u201cMost people learn about Indigenous cultures from media made by non-Indigenous people, which can skew stereotypical, biased, and even derogatory and discriminatory,\u201d Rawal points out. \u201cThe type of romanticizing, the tropes that people expect to see in Native-American stories\u2014we didn\u2019t care about that [in our film]. We didn\u2019t care to elaborate on the history of genocide because there are no Native people, I believe, that don\u2019t know about genocide. We focused on characters; we focused on healing narratives.\u201dIs there a way to celebrate Thanksgiving and still be respectful of Indigenous people? When people ask her this, Black Elk\u2019s \u201cvery simple\u201d answer is no. \u201cYou can\u2019t celebrate the day, but you can have a day where you talk about the history, where you talk about the truth.\u201d She points out that some people have started using terms like \u2018Thanks-taking\u2019 and \u2018Truths-giving\u2019 to acknowledge the difficult history behind the day. \u201cIt\u2019s okay to be honest, it\u2019s okay to tell the truth, and still be a thankful person,\u201d she says.How to further support Black Elk, Rawal, their work, and Indigenous communities. Rawal suggests donating to First Nations Development Institute, the co-producers of the film. \u201cThey\u2019re accepting donations for long-term COVID relief, which means rebuilding Native food systems. 100 percent of donations go to that work, which is happening across Indian Country.\u201dBlack Elk and her husband, Luke Black Elk, through his family\u2019s non-profit, have been making food kits filled with Indigenous foods for elders.
