It\u2019s for the true garlic aficionados. The garlic broth swillers. The fearless devotees who won\u2019t balk at the prospect of putting four heads of garlic\u2014that\u2019s one head of garlic per person, mind you\u2014into an otherwise very tame chicken recipe.Now that I\u2019ve alienated a large swath of you, dear readers, let me qualify: This new recipe uses the Charlie\u2019s Angels trifecta of olive oil, heat, and time to produce a garlic situation that\u2019s more chill Aquarian than raging Scorpio, plus some fall-off-the-bone tender chicken to boot.The whole thing only takes ten minutes to prep\u2014chicken legs, salt, sliced lemon, all that garlic, a few sprigs of thyme, a fresh chile (if you have one), and an ungodly amount of olive oil all meet up in one baking dish\u2014but it needs some good QT in the oven to roast. You\u2019ll know it\u2019s ready when the meat is barely hanging on, and everything is bubbling and crisp (read: about an hour and a half).Once it cooled down, I popped the soft, melty garlic cloves out of their skins and stirred them back in with the chicken. You could keep them intact if you like the idea of garlic more than reality of garlic garlic everywhere, but please see above for my true feelings on this subject. You can add a green salad (because #healthyish, right?), but real garlic worshippers know the move is to ditch the fork and soak up as much of the stuff as possible with a loaf of bread.Which brought me back to another prized moment: That time I got lost in Tuscany and had one of the best, most garlicky meals of my life. I'll never find that random village or restaurant again, but I'll always have this recipe\u2014and my strong, lingering garlic... memories\u2014to bring me back.Get the recipe:Roast Chicken Legs with Lots of GarlicAnd we mean lots.View RecipeRecipes you want to make.
