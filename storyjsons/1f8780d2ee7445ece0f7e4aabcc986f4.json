Oh. There\u2019s a little room in there? In the \u201cCanned Tomato\u201d section? Perfect. Because we figured you\u2019d like to know a couple things about canned tomatoes, particularly how you can get the most flavor out of them and make all of the dishes containing them taste (approximately) ten times  better.Here\u2019s a fact for you: Canned tomatoes aren\u2019t fully cooked. They are cooked, just not to the point or with the method that we\u2019d like them to be. When tomatoes are canned, they get soaked in hot tomato juice, sealed, and then heated to kill any potentially harmful organisms. Basically, canned tomatoes are cooked to make them shelf stable, not to make them tasty.This is why canned tomatoes still have a raw tomato flavor to them. They sit in tomato limbo, somewhere between cooked and raw. (If you\u2019ve ever eaten a tomato right out of the can, you\u2019ll know what we\u2019re talking about here.) The sugars in the tomato aren\u2019t developed, and they taste pretty watery. But we can fix this! It\u2019s up to us to make sure they actually taste like something by the time you\u2019re eating your pasta pomodoro.There's the colander, sitting on top of the bowl. All the liquid falls right through!\nSo here\u2019s what you do: Grab a colander and place it on top of a medium-sized bowl. Open your can of whole peeled tomatoes and pour them into the colander so the liquid strains into the bowl below and the tomatoes are left up top. Separating the tomatoes from the liquid is step number one. (Keep that liquid, by the way!) Cooking the tomatoes is step number two.You want to give your tomatoes contact with a direct heat source. That means cooking them at the bottom of whatever saucepan or Dutch oven you\u2019re using. The goal here is to remove water from the tomato solids and allow them to caramelize somewhat, which will concentrate their flavor. Less water and more caramelization means more sweetness, acidity, and complexity in whatever dish those tomatoes are a part of\u2014what's not to like?Adding the drained tomatoes to a Dutch oven to develop flavor. Classic.\nOnce you concentrate the flavor of the tomato solids, you can add the liquid back in. That tomato liquid will lose water content and concentrate over time as well, but the tomato solids would have never developed as much flavor if we had skipped that first step and thrown everything in at once. From there, it's business as usual, whether you're building a sauce for pasta, simmering some soup, or whipping up a big batch of chili.Oh. Damn. That was only one piece of tomato trivia. We still owe you a second fact. Well, the world\u2019s tallest recorded tomato plant was measured at a height of 65 feet. That\u2019s pretty tall! And if every tomato on that plant got canned, we'd eat them all\u2014just as long as they were drained and cooked first.Now, let's put that method to work with some simple ribollita:Simple RibollitaThis (vegetarian!) Italian classic is about as comforting as it gets, packed with hearty greens, meaty beans, and plenty of rich olive oil and umami-packed Parm.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titBasicallyCanned TomatoesRecipes you want to make.
