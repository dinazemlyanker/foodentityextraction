As you cook the potatoes, add just enough water so they can steam and turn tender without sticking to the pot. You want the final texture to have chickpeas and broken chunks of potato suspended in a delicious mash. Serve it alongside Fruit Chow, Tomato Choka, Curry Goat, and the main event: the flaky Buss Up Shut Paratha Roti.Ingredients4 - 6 Servings2Tbsp. vegetable oil2Tbsp.

I would cut it back to 1 teaspoon next time. Anonymouscold spring, ny2/9/2022whew, this one is <b>SPICY</b>. It was fun to make the Green Seasoning, and overall the dish was not super labor intensive. I was pretty generous with the seasoning since that recipe makes a ton, so that could explain the spicy level. I agree with the other reviewer that I'll be a little hesitant eating the left overs since its so intense. Enjoy! KonstantinDurham, NC2/7/2022Such a comforting, limey dish with nice heat. It is a bit involved to make the green seasoning (mostly because it requires a lot of ingredients), but you really can't skip it. Don't sub Trinidad seasoning peppers with more 3 more scotch bonnets like I did. Once you have the green seasoning, it is simple to make. I found that the potatoes took 15-20 minutes longer than the recipe calls for...and it dried out a few times, so you'll want to keep an eye on it. Overall it was pretty good, but I didn't end up reaching for the leftovers.AnonymousBrooklyn, NY10/27/2020Explore Bon App\u00e9titTrinidadianCaribbeanPotatoVegetableChickpeaBeanYukon Gold PotatoSideGluten-FreeDairy-FreeVegetarianVeganSimmerDinnerRecipes you want to make.
