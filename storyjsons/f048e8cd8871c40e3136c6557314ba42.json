I\u2019m my own plot twist! The following is a day-by-day prep\u2014a training montage, if you will\u2014for my recent weeknight party that could model how to grab your own enemy by the guts, even on a Tuesday.Five Days Out: Mopping and ShoppingClean: There\u2019s a micro-particulate layer of dust in my house that\u2019s only visible when I know a judgmental guest is about to visit. Four or five days is near enough to the party that my deep-ish clean (like, I get out the counter sprays) will hold up. Since I have two tall friends, I also dust even the high shelf.Supply: A weeknight dinner party isn\u2019t the time for ingredients that could take their last breath on the way home from the store, and it\u2019s not the time for a creamy pasta that has to be mixed \u00e0 la minute. Because I can\u2019t stash fresh morels (a tragedy!) five days in advance, I always stack the menu with dishes that either cook fast or keep well. For this party, I decided on parsnip soup, steak with chimichurri, zesty-ass couscous, and a huge salad that I\u2019m mainly excited about because of pistachios. Every dish has make-ahead components: the steak marinates, the soup matures. This staggering is key to time management for a hectic  night. The day before, I\u2019ll snag the few sensitive dudes (sad bagged arugula; cherry tomatoes) on my way home from work.Recruit: On the night of the dinner, I\u2019ll only have an hour and this hour will feel like 38 seconds. I ask my prompt friends to bring over cheeses now so that they can shop with ease. Some dreamy Bucheron during the drinking-and-immediate-gossip hour will distract from my howling in the kitchen.I also pick up an easy-breezy-beautiful dessert that will hold its own in the freezer. Wow, you sized me up very quickly: Yes, I always buy ice cream. My greatest design flaw is that I don\u2019t like sweet things, but my greatest asset is that I\u2019m selfless. I get cardamom ice cream (Three Twins!) and ginger cookies and think about my shortcomings.Three Days Out: Soup and Other Things That Keep WellIf you have a lovely little boring streak like me, the sensation of being prepared and organized is fleeting but ecstatic. So a few days in advance, I set out to accomplish the bulk of the prep: I make a trough-load of lemon vinaigrette. I roast beets for the salad. And since many soups are most delicious after hanging for a couple days\u2014so the ingredients can stop being polite and start getting real\u2014I make the parsnip soup from start to finish.Doing the labor-intensive tasks now also means I have my pre-hosting panic\u2014let\u2019s cancel everything! let\u2019s leave! let\u2019s go to Ojai!\u2014two nights in advance, rather than two hours in advance. This is a very generous amount of time to wind myself back to baseline.The Night Before: MarinatingIt\u2019s weeknight dinner party eve! It\u2019s the hour of marinating! A convenient phone alert reminded me to scootch home and get the steaks under their sauce. For this party, I\u2019ll also toast and plump the couscous a day in advance (controversial, yes, but if well-stirred, a lemony couscous can be just as delicious a day later). And with the steak getting juicy and the couscous getting cozy in the fridge, I\u2019m 85% done.Late Night Before: OverachievingI employ some useless restless energy to set the table, with the glasses and plates turned upside down for dust protection (and doesn\u2019t it sort of look like they\u2019re sleeping?). Usually, I\u2019m super cool/casual and save table-setting for when first guests arrive, but a weeknight dinner party is never not a scramble, so I know something else will crop up. It\u2019s the time to use all the forward-thinking I can get.Morning Of: Pre-Scramble ShuffleHousekeeping tasks. I empty the dishwasher, tidy the counters, take out the trash. I make sure the wine is in the fridge. I get the stool out and unearth the water pitcher from a high place. I rustle my bones about 20 minutes early to get through the list, knowing it will be worth it on the other end. This is the stuff that really adds up in the WILD HOUR before people arrive.The WILD HOUR BeforeThe time is now! When I arrive on the scene, many dishes squeal for attention, so I triage, focusing on the most urgent matters: Since the soup will take the longest to warm up, I get that on the stove first. Then I pull out anything from the fridge that needs to be at room temperature  and start chopping the vegetables and herbs to complete the salad and the couscous. Then, I leave the kitchen to air out my armpits and change clothes. I think it\u2019s kinda elegant to be chopping parsley as someone arrives\u2014instead, someone usually rings the doorbell as I\u2019m brushing my teeth or putting a bra back on.My friends always run late, which I love because it means I actually have time to extract the goat cheese from its tube and throw fresh things on top of the couscous. I sear the steak after we\u2019re done with soup, waiting for the perfect moment to say: \u201cRare or medium-rare?\u201d While the steak rests, I dress and toss the salad, then bring everything to the table at once. Wow, it\u2019s almost like I planned this graceful staggering! I\u2019m waiting for someone to call me organized. Instead, reviews are only in for the steak (\u201cprovocative\u201d; just kidding no one said that, it\u2019s steak, everyone loves it).At dessert, I steal someone\u2019s seat so I can face away from both the rubble of pots in the sink and the fact it\u2019s almost Thursday. If the dinner party never ends, you\u2019ll never have to do the dishes!Maggie Lange writes for magazines mainly about music, salty food, books, curly hair, and other things she loves.
