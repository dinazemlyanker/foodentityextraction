But does that mean we should all be vegetarian...or vegan? Not everyone thinks it\u2019s that easy, not even BA\u2019s senior cooking editor Sarah Jampel and video host Chrissy Tracey, both lifelong vegetarians. On the third episode of the Healthyish podcast, Sarah and Chrissy join Amanda Shapiro (not a lifelong vegetarian) to talk about their plant-based paths, when and why they break the rules, and how to cook to please even your most carnivorous friends...just in time for your July 4th cookouts.ContentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Stuff we talk about in this episode:Andrea Nguyen\u2019s Vegetarian Chicken Soup Recipe\u00a0Sarah Jampel\u2019s vegetarian column on HealthyishChrissy\u2019s Fried Oyster MushroomsChrissy\u2019s Rum-Soaked Fruit and Coconut Sundae recipeChrissy\u2019s Rum-Soaked Fruit and Coconut Sundae videoHow to ListenListen to this episode through the audio player on this page or subscribe via\u00a0Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you get your podcasts for all six episodes.
