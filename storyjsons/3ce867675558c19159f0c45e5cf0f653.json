I started Sugar and Charm in 2010 to inspire readers on how to host beautiful parties and teach the art of entertaining. From shooting recipe photography to cooking for my own family, our kitchen is the most important room in our home\u2013and for a good reason!We\u2019ve designed our last two kitchens, and the options for stylish appliances have been pretty minimal. Of course, we still love a classic stainless-steel look, but gone are the days that you are limited to one color. With the new Caf\u00e9 Matte Collection, you can build your own beautiful appliances to match your dream kitchen and choose something that reflects your personal style\u2013select from a stylish Matte Black or an elevated Matte White finish, and match with four different hardware options. From Brushed Black, Brushed Bronze, Brushed Stainless, and Brushed Copper, you can refresh your kitchen just by switching out the hardware.There\u2019s something about a clean, all-white kitchen and this one is stunning! It uses the Matte White finish with Brushed Bronze hardware. The Matte White is timeless and creates a warm and inviting atmosphere. This kitchen would be a dream to bake something sweet and savory in like Cast Iron Olive Oil Apple Pies, one of my favorite recipes for fall.Notice how everything goes beautifully with the matching cabinet knobs? The Brushed Bronze accents perfectly complement some of our favorite kitchen accessories. Whip up a Tokyo Mule and serve it in a copper mug.Eden PassanteFor a bolder look, I love the sleek Matte Black appliances with a darker cabinet color. It connects natural tones and creates a soothing, layered look with just the right amount of contrast.Grab your favorite serve ware and throw together your go-to meal. One of my all-time favorites for entertaining is Slow Cooker Chili, which is great for making in large batches and easy to prep (plus, the aromas that fill the house from cooking all day are sure to get them hungry!). Serve your guests in matte black bowls to match your kitchen.Eden PassanteIf white is more your preference, the Matte White also looks great with darker cabinets. Paint your open shelving the same color as the cabinets for a complete chic look. Brushed Bronze looks fantastic in this kitchen and adds warmth to the kitchen.Finally, high-performance appliances that are incredibly stylish and customizable.
