I\u2019ve never read the ingredients on the back of the tube, nor have I thought twice about buying a drugstore brand\u2014but should I? Some mainstream toothpastes contain controversial ingredients, like the antibacterial agent triclosan, which which can disrupt hormones and promote drug resistant infections. Yet again, Instagram presented me with a well-branded alternative: Hello charcoal toothpaste. Yes, black toothpaste made with the stuff you might barbeque a hamburger on. It promised to be \u201cdetoxifying\u201d and \u201cwhitening,\u201d so I decided to give it a try.Hello\u2019s toothpaste, like many of these alternative charcoal toothpastes, are vegan and free of dyes and artificial sweeteners. Some are also fluoride-free, but I wanted to try a version with fluoride because research has shown that brushing with fluoride makes a big difference for cavity formation, and I don\u2019t want to mess with that. The verdict? It was definitely different from the stuff I\u2019ve been using since I was brushing my baby teeth. The flavor was familiarly minty, but it made a huge mess in my sink because it really is pitch-black. And while the charcoal seemed like it was buffing out surface stains because of its abrasive nature, according to the Mayo Clinic, extreme whitening can be difficult to get without peroxide.I liked using this toothpaste for the flavor and because it made my teeth feel super clean but I did have some concerns about the safety of consuming activated charcoal, an ingredient I don\u2019t usually put in my mouth. So I asked Dr. John K. Brooks, a clinical professor at the University of Maryland School of Dentistry, what he thought about the trend of charcoal toothpaste. I say trend, but he notes in a recent academic publication that charcoal has been used for oral hygiene for thousands of years\u2014Hippocrates (yes, ancient Greece Hippocrates) even wrote about it.Looking at the charcoal toothpaste brands on the market, Dr. Brooks discovered that most do not release their abrasiveness scores, which are required to be under a specific value to get an American Dental Association (ADA) seal of approval. This makes it difficult to know how tough they are on enamel long-term. Two of Hello\u2019s toothpastes are ADA approved, but not the ones containing activated charcoal.\u201cThere is not a body of research to support the effectiveness or safety [of charcoal toothpaste]\u201d Dr. Brooks says. Studies done on charcoal and dental care to this point have been about the use of raw charcoal in indigenous populations around the world. In these cases, overuse of charcoal actually made teeth look more yellow once the outer layer of enamel was scraped away.Dr. Brooks also notes that Hello\u2019s and other brand\u2019s claims that charcoal toothpastes are detoxifying are not backed up by research. \u201cShow me the evidence there,\u201d Dr. Brooks says, pointing out that charcoal compounds do have viable medical uses, but their antibiotic properties in oral care remains uninvestigated. He recommends that consumers look for the ADA seal of approval when deciding on a toothpaste.\u201cI\u2019m not saying don\u2019t use these products, but you should have a conversation with your dentist,\u201d Dr. Brooks says. For me, the fact the abrasiveness of activated charcoal toothpaste hasn\u2019t been rigorously tested yet means I\u2019m going to be sticking with my old standard toothpaste for now. It doesn\u2019t look as pretty on social media, but it makes my sink look a whole lot better. And why are we \u2019gramming our toothpaste, anyway?Buy it: Hello Activated Charcoal Toothpaste, 4 for $18.All products featured on Healthyish are independently selected by our editors.
