Birthed from this notion, and from their frustration with local laundromats and drop-off and app services, German-born sisters Corinna and Theresa Williams created Celsious, a new kind of laundromat. Nestled on North 7th street in Williamsburg, the \u201cclean\u201d laundromat uses biodegradable detergents, hosts regular community events, and, now, offers a full cafe menu in collaboration with Nourish Kitchen + Table.\u201cWe\u2019re very diligent when it comes to sourcing ingredients and aim to be zero-waste in our operations,\u201d Theresa explains. \u201cWhen we decided to expand [our existing] caf\u00e9 menu, we wanted to showcase these values in the food.\u201d Leading this charge is nutritionist and chef Marissa Lippert, whom the duo met through Igna Lena, a mutual friend and fellow entrepreneur. \u201cWe immediately bonded with Marissa over shared NYC-business-owner trials and tribulations,\u201d Corinna says.Sisters Theresa and Corinna Williams, who own Celsious laundromat and cafe\nPhoto by Emma FishmanOn a recent light-drenched afternoon, customers lingered in the cafe, even if they weren\u2019t doing laundry. \u201cSince the roll out, we have more customers hunkering down for hours-long work sessions or meetings, and it\u2019s great to have sweet and savory offerings now to carry them through a full day,\u201d Theresa says. Behind a subway tile-inspired counter is a menu inspired by the brick-and-mortar Nourish Kitchen + Table, which Lippert ran until last year, with plenty of custom additions, like the Wash & Wait cheese plate with Goatlet, Bandaged Bismark, and Naked Pruner cheeses sourced from Brooklyn\u2019s own Crown Finish Caves.Lippert took a conscious approach to the menu, incorporating methods like fermentation, dehydration, and  whole-ingredient cooking. Watermelon radish-apple kimchi, fermented quince, and pear, cabbage and fennel krauts are added to baked goods and served on toasts and salads. Dehydrated fruits and vegetables get turned into the flours that go into the rotating pastry offerings. A carrot cake cinnamon bun is savory, sweet, and vibrantly colored thanks to the carrot flour that\u2019s folded in. A savory baby babka bun made with kimchi puts an umami-packed spin on a New York classic. On a recent weekday, a tartine with labneh, fresh mint, harissa-brown butter, preserved Meyer lemon, mustard greens, and lamb kofte exploded with flavor and deterred a 2:30 p.m. slump.House-cultured yogurt with blood orange, hibiscus-vanilla reduction, toasted hazelnut and cacao nib.\nPhoto by Emma Fishman\u201cMy goal for the cafe is to continually evolve our food while we inform and feed customers in the most intentional way possible,\u201d Lippert says. \u201cFor me, that comes through working closely with local farmers and purveyors, respecting the ingredients we feature, and passing that along to customers.\u201dThe daily laundry scene at Celsious\nPhoto by Emma FishmanThe beverage list aligns with the thoughtfulness and quality. Ronnybrook Creamline Milk is delivered in glass bottles, which are returned to maintain a zero-waste way of doing dairy. Almond milk is made in-house daily using raw organic almonds, serving as the base for the Coco Matcha, which features CAP Beauty\u2019s organic ceremonial grade matcha. Leftover almond meal shows up later in the caf\u00e9\u2019s Turmeric Power Balls. There\u2019s also cold brew on tap along with rotating kombucha flavors from Vermont-based Aqua ViTea, apple cider vinegar from Westwind Orchard, the first organic orchard in New York State, and tea from Jil Larsen of Magic Mix.\u201cThere\u2019s a connectivity between how we eat, what we wear, and how we feel,\u201d Corinna says. \u201cWe hope that while you care for your clothing, you can care for your mind and body too.\u201dThe caf\u00e9 and laundromat are currently open 7 a.m. to midnight, with the opening hour switching to 8 a.m. as of April 22.The perfect snack plate: Turmeric-rose tea egg,  housemade \u201ceverything spiced\u201d focaccia, fenugreek labneh, smoked chili salsa macha with meyer lemon, and seasonal pickles\nPhoto by Emma FishmanExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishNew York CityTrendsBrooklynRead MoreLifestyleHow to Make and Drink the Perfect Cup of Yerba MateBy Aliza AbarbanelRecipes you want to make.
