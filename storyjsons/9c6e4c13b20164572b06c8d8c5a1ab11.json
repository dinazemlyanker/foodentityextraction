Flip the steaks often so the fat renders evenly without overcooking the meat. And don\u2019t sleep on that herb salad\u2014it brings some freshness to the sticky-salty-sweet steaks.Ingredients8 servings4medium shallots, 2 chopped, 2 thinly sliced6garlic cloves\u2153cup plus 3 Tbsp. fish sauce\u2153cup plus 3 Tbsp. fresh lime juice3Tbsp. light brown sugar, divided8\u00be\"-thick pork shoulder steaks (3\u00bd\u20134 lb. total)2red or green Thai chiles, thinly sliced3cups Thai or sweet basil leaves, cilantro leaves with tender stems, and/or dillPreparationStep 1Blend chopped shallots, garlic, \u2153 cup fish sauce, \u2153 cup lime juice, and 2 Tbsp. brown sugar in a blender until smooth.Step 2Season steaks lightly with salt (the fish sauce will also season the steaks). Transfer to a large bowl or a 12x9\" baking dish. Pour marinade over and turn steaks with tongs to coat evenly. Let sit at room temperature 1 hour, or cover and chill up to 12 hours, turning once (halfway through if you can).Step 3Preheat a grill to high heat. Grill steaks, turning every minute or 2, until lightly charred and crisp and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part registers 140\u00b0, 7\u20139 minutes. Transfer steaks to a cutting board and let rest at least 5 minutes before thinly slicing.Step 4Meanwhile, mix chiles, remaining 3 Tbsp. fish sauce, remaining 3 Tbsp. lime juice, remaining 1 Tbsp. brown sugar, and 1 Tbsp. water in a large bowl to combine. Add sliced shallots and herbs and toss to coat; season lightly with salt.Step 5Arrange sliced meat on a platter and scatter herb salad over.How would you rate Grilled Pork Shoulder Steaks With Herb Salad?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (5)Back to TopTriangleSo Delicious! \n\nI made this along with the Tri Tip with Tiger Bite Sauce for a dinner party and people couldn\u2019t stop eating either, but for me this became my new favorite. I only needed to marinate the pork a few hours max - and the sauce was delicious - I was worried I didn\u2019t have enough herbs, but a little went a long way. 100% will make again. AnonymousMichigan 9/1/2020This dish was amazing! I added rice noodles which made the meal go a little further and it was spectacular. I also couldn't find Thai chilis so I drizzled sambal oelek on top. I'll be adding this meal to my regular dinner options. AnonymousMinneapolis, MN8/11/2020I know a dish is good when I keep thinking about it days after I cooked it. This is one of those dishes. The marinade, the fresh herb salad and (for me) a new take on pork shoulder and steak. Love. This. Dish!mufb87PA5/20/2020Quite possibly one of the best pork dishes I\u2019ve ever made. The herb salad with the dressing was so good I\u2019m gonna make a batch of the dressing for regular use! AnonymousChicago 5/10/2020This was delicious. I was low on fish sauce and used it all in the marinade. I left it out of the herb salad with no substitutions, and we didn\u2019t miss it.
