So\u2014in this age of ultra-efficiency and impatience, when we demand that everything we order from the internet come the next day and every show we watch be released all at once\u2014why bother?Well, you probably already know that from-dry beans have a superior texture (creamy-not-mushy) and\u2014since you season them from the get-go\u2014a superior taste. But enough about that. What we don't talk about enough when we talk about cooking dried beans is that you're not just making beans: You're also making soup.By adding lots of vegetables, aromatics, and all sorts of other goodies (spices, Parmesan rinds, lemon peel, dried chiles, slab bacon) to the bean-cooking liquid, you're not only flavoring those beans. You're also multitasking, cooking beans and making broth at the same time. How's that for ultra-efficiency?This technique is the basis of Navy Bean and Escarole Stew, Pasta e Fagioli, and Carla Lalli Music's newest recipe, Hammy Chickpea Soup. You add carrots, garlic, onion, crushed red pepper flakes, smoked paprika, cumin seeds, and\u2014the not-so-secret secret ingredient\u2014a smoky, salty ham hock to the pot with the chickpeas. You let the whole thing simmer away until the beans are tender and the vegetables have given all they have to give to the greater soup cause. You could stop there\u2014shred the meat from the ham hock, toss it back into the pot, call it dinner\u2014but by pur\u00e9eing the vegetables and a portion of the chickpeas, the soup goes from thin and brothy to silky and creamy.Let's say that you want beans but you don't want soup. Maybe it's \"still summer.\" Maybe you live in Southern California. Maybe you're making pasta or salad because maybe you're not yet a \"soup person.\" Fine. Fine! We'd still argue that you should make that cooking liquid taste so good that you'd want to slurp it. Because once you've strained those beans, you can save that liquid (freeze it, even) and use it whenever you'd use broth\u2014braises, stuffing, gravy, or...soups. Hey, we said you weren't a soup person yet.Soup's on:Hammy Chickpea SoupName a better activity for an autumnal, sweater-weather Sunday than simmering a cozy soup.
