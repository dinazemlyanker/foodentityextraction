As it hits the pinto beans, dancing in their pot, notes of garlic, achiote, and oregano fill the air. While the beans cook, she pulls the tostones out of the fryer and hits them with a light sprinkle of another powder, this one as yellow as the plantains. A beloved standard in many Boricua kitchens, saz\u00f3n and adobo are always kept at the ready\u2014and when I need to replenish, I look for Loisa.Loisa Organic Saz\u00f3n Seasoning$11 at Amazon$19 at Loisa (pack of 2)Historically, my family (and almost everyone else I knew) always used Goya\u2019s saz\u00f3n and adobo. So when I came across Loisa, I was intrigued: A company that dared to compete with Goya? (This was a year before the boycott of the brand, which sent many looking for alternatives.) After I got my hands on Loisa\u2019s adobo and saz\u00f3n, I hurried to my grandma\u2019s house, and with a lot of convincing, she gave it a try. The deep red saz\u00f3n carried a strong aroma of cumin and garlic, and the almost glistening gold adobo popped with the flavors of turmeric, garlic, and a hint of oregano. After using Loisa, Goya seemed pale in comparison. Even my grandma, grudgingly, was impressed.Kenny Luna, Scott Hattis, and Yadira Garcia started Loisa to recreate the Latin seasonings they loved but with organic ingredients and no dyes or preservatives\u2014and they ended up with products that taste brighter and more flavorful than the other versions too. The saz\u00f3n adds smokiness and depth to sancocho or arroz con gandules. I sprinkle the adobo on top of root vegetables for an enhanced savory flavor (your fried yuca will never be the same) and incorporate it into marinades for pernil.Loisa Organic Adobo Seasoning$11 at Amazon$19 at Loisa (pack of 2)I don\u2019t have to change my grandma\u2019s recipes when using Loisa because the seasoning blends have been formulated with Puerto Rican cooking in mind. They may not be the ones that my grandma grew up with, but Loisa adobo and saz\u00f3n have earned spots in her kitchen\u2014and in mine.Explore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingLifestyleHighly RecommendRecipes you want to make.
