But you might not know that this gloriously shellacked pork shoulder from James Dumapit, former chef de cuisine at Aaron Franklin and Tyson Cole\u2019s new Austin barbecue spot, Loro, is practically begging to be cooked in one. Inspired by the classic Cantonese barbecued pork dish known as char siu, this marinated pork shoulder is cooked in a closed Egg until tender, then glazed over a blast of heat that creates addictive crispy bits all around the outside.\u201cWe could have given you a smoked pork shoulder that takes all day and gets super shred-y,\u201d says senior food editor Chris Morocco, who tested the recipe. \u201cBut the goal here is something more unexpected. We wanted the meat to be consistent throughout, but not have it take so long that it would bum you out.\u201dThe Egg, of course, has a longer lifespan of heat than a chimney full of coals. Plus, you can control and adjust the temperature, as opposed to ultra-hot flames that gradually cool down as time goes on. But that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t actually make this recipe if you don\u2019t have a Big Green Egg. The solution? The pork shoulder goes in an oven for the majority of the time and then finishes on a grill.You don\u2019t need a Big Green Egg to make this pork, but it does make all the cooking happen in one place.\nBig Green EggThe ingredients are the same and the time involved is the same\u2014it\u2019s just a matter of starting the meat in a 350\u00b0 oven, as opposed to a 350\u00b0 Big Green Egg. See, the oven is as controlled of an environment as the Egg. But then instead of cranking up the heat in that same vessel, you light up your grill (either gas or charcoal is fine in this case), transfer the pork shoulder to that, and let the flames work their magic to create the glazed, crackly, caramelized crust that sets this dish over the top.\u201cYou\u2019re going to lose some amount of smokiness, because your oven doesn\u2019t get smoky, and it doesn\u2019t spend too much time over open fire\u201d Morocco says. \u201cBut it\u2019s still truly worth doing.\u201d Let\u2019s just say that the iterations made in the test kitchen with the oven and grill combination disappeared exceedingly quickly. Point being, either way you make it, just call it pork candy.Get the Big Green Egg recipe:Sticky-Sweet Grilled Pork ShoulderBarbecue god Aaron Franklin and his team came up with the recipe for this sticky-sweet pork shoulder you\u2019ll want to make all summer.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titGrillPork ShoulderRead MorecookingI\u2019m Sick and Tired of People Hating on Pork TenderloinBy Alex Delanyculture7 Online Butchers That Bring Quality Meat to Your DoorstepBy Ashley MasonRecipes you want to make.
