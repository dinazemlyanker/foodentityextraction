And the vinaigrette from her book \u00c0 Table is decidedly solid. Spiked with earthy capers, bright with acid, and barely tempered with honey, it makes this already great salad truly memorable. Tempting as it might be, don\u2019t skip blanching the lemon slices before frying. It takes only a few more minutes and stamps out unwanted bitterness in the lemon pith.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.
