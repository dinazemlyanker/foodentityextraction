Because it's delicious, that's why.By Alex DelanyJanuary 29, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailPeden + MunkFacebookTwitterEmailMarinating meat in yogurt will change your life. Well, maybe not change your life but...at least how you think about marinating. Don\u2019t believe me? Read on, dear reader.Yogurt tenderizes meat much more gently and effectively than regular marinades. While acidic vinegar- or citrus-based marinades can toughen proteins like chicken breast to a rubbery consistency, yogurt slowly tenderizes them, resulting in meat that can practically be pulled apart by hand. Yogurt marinades are highly effective when left on proteins for an elongated period of time (in the 12 hour ball park), but they work well in short-term scenarios too.That\u2019s because yogurt marinades also create a uniquely-textured and flavorful crust around proteins, regardless of marinating time. Like all marinades, yogurt will be the first thing to cook when your meat is exposed to heat. The sugar in traditional marinades is the first thing to caramelize, but in yogurt, it\u2019s dairy that caramelizes initially. Instead of a crispy, golden brown texture, you\u2019ll get something else entirely. Sure, you\u2019ll still have crispiness, but there will be an underlying softness (almost like a layer of insulation) from the caramelized dairy proteins and sugars. It makes a piece of tender, juicy meat that much more special.Our favorite cooking method for yogurt-marinated proteins is grilling\u2014there's something incredibly alluring about the combo of caramelized yogurt and smoke\u2014but a high-heat oven roast or pan sear will also get the job done. It\u2019s really up to you (and, you know, the weather).And if you\u2019re wondering what yogurt to use, we can help. Plain, unstrained yogurt is best (You definitely do not want any vanilla in there.). You can use Greek yogurt, but since it contains less moisture, you\u2019ll need to loosen it with a little lemon juice or vinegar to properly coat your protein.You can marinate a whole chicken in yogurt.\u00a0\nChristopher TestaniNow, you just need to decide what flavor profile you\u2019re going for. Mixing in some ginger and lemongrass works beautifully. Taking a more Middle Eastern route, with cumin, ground chiles, garlic, and fresh herbs, is always a solid move. At the end of the day, the same flavor profiles you\u2019d use with regular beef, lamb, chicken and pork marinades work with yogurt. And if your friends need convincing, don\u2019t bother trying to use words. Just hand them a piece of grilled, yogurt-marinated chicken and tell them to take a bite. Trust.Yogurt. Marinated. Lamb.
