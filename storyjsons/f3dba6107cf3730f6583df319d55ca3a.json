Felicia Cocotzin Ruiz, a folk healer who educates on using food as medicine through her brand Kitchen Curandera, pairs alliums with ginger and honey for a soothing, savory-sweet syrup. \u201cThis has the same soothing feeling as chicken soup,\" she says, though she adds that \u201cpeople dealing with a bad cough should go see a healthcare provider.\u201d Cocotzin Ruiz makes this cough syrup with small, sweet I\u2019itoi onions, which grow in the Sonoran Desert where she lives, but shallots can be substituted without compromise.Ingredientsmakes about \u00bd cup1small bunch I\u2019itoi onions, white parts only, or 2 large or 3 medium shallots, coarsely chopped12\" piece ginger, peeled, sliced \u00bc\" thick\u00becup runny honeyPreparationStep 1Place onions and ginger in a small saucepan (1\u20132 qt. works well) so they cover bottom. Pour honey over to submerge. Bring to a boil over medium-high, then immediately reduce heat to low. Simmer gently, running a heatproof rubber spatula across the bottom from time to time, 30 minutes (this will give the onions and ginger time to infuse the honey). Let cool slightly.Step 2Strain honey through a fine-mesh sieve into a small heatproof jar. Let cool and cover. Save onions and ginger separately to eat, if you\u2019d like.Step 3To use, mix 1 Tbsp. throat soother into tea or hot water, or eat directly off the spoon. (Use 1 tsp. for children.)Step 4Do ahead: Throat soother can be made 1 month ahead.

I\u2019m saving it for when I really need it Linda in Albuquerque Albuquerque NM1/25/2021Wouldn't you know, I was scrolling the new bon appetit recipes and happened to come across this with a sore throat. Delicious on it's own by the spoonful, and nice stirred into tea as well (I did yerba mate). For having onions in it it's really quite pleasant. Can't say it's a magical cure but it does feel soothing, as advertised.
