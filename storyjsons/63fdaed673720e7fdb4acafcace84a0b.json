Until recently, I had no idea how to seed a pomegranate; those ruby-red seeds were one of the few ingredients that I always bought ready-to-eat.There is a myth\u2014and yes, it's just a myth!\u2014that pomegranates are a huge pain to de-seed yourself, that you're not very likely to get all of them out, and that you'll make a big stain-inducing mess in the process. But what if we told you it's not actually as hard as you think? And that from now on you can buy full pomegranates for way less of the money than it costs when someone else is doing the work.Here's how: Cut the pomegranate in half through the equator, then a hold it over a bowl of water, cut side down. With a wooden spoon, smack the skin assertively and repeatedly and watch the seeds hail down. Yep, that's really it.There are other videos on the internet that use a similar method, though often they use a paring knife to carve the pomegranate into a flower-like shape ahead of time. We think that's unnecessary if you use our patented (not really) water method. While the seeds sink to the bottom, any white membrane bits that come out will float the top. You can scoop those out with a slotted spoon once you're done, then drain the water from the seeds.Sure, you might still want to a wear an apron to avoid splatter, but now you're well on your way to making wheat berry bowls with merguez and pomegranate, citrus-pomegranate relish, and Moroccan lamb shanks with pomegranate.Lady from the subway, if you're out there, I hope you're reading this.More pomegranate recipes right this way:1 / 21ChevronChevronShredded Cabbage Salad with Pomegranate and TomatoesView RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titPomegranateHealthyishFruitRecipes you want to make.
