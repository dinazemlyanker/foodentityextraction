The cult-favorite fast-food chain with locations across the Southeast is centered on burgers (which you can get as part of a combo tray at 3 a.m. with a corn dog and a chicken quesadilla on the side, if you\u2019re into that).But there are also more than 40 shakes on Cook Out\u2019s menu, including flavors like fresh banana and peach cobbler. I\u2019ve never tried one I didn\u2019t like. However, the flavor I look forward to all year long is watermelon, made with the creamiest vanilla ice cream and bite-size chunks of real fruit. It\u2019s only available in July and August, a.k.a. the two most sweltering months of summer, but that\u2019s part of what makes it so craveable: You gotta strike while the temps are hot. And you\u2019ll keep going back until September hits because this thing is like air-conditioning you can drink.Go there: Cook OutExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendRecipes you want to make.
