How could you not?!By Alex DelanyAugust 6, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Chelsie CraigFacebookTwitterEmailThis is Highly Recommend, a column dedicated to our very opinionated editors\u2019 favorite things to eat, drink, and buy.Last time I was in Baltimore, I was thirsty. Really thirsty. As I perused the little happy hour menu card at Wet City Brewing, I waited for something extra cold and quenching to catch my eye. I got all the way to the end when I spotted it: Spaghett - $5. I ordered it based on the name alone. How could you not!?! Spaghetti without the eeee?!?Truly, I\u2019m thankful I did, because this cocktail has become my official drink of summer. It\u2019s got just three ingredients\u2014Miller High Life, Aperol, and lemon juice\u2014and had all the characteristics I was looking for without my even knowing it: light, fruity, slightly bitter, and just tart enough to lead you back for another sip.It\u2019s so straight forward, I\u2019ve brought the recipe home. I just pour an ounce of Aperol and lemon juice directly into a bottle of High Life, aaaand done. The bubbly, rose gold liquid goes down easy, especially when it\u2019s cold as it can be without turning into a beer slushie. Which, now that I\u2019m thinking of it, might not be that bad of an idea. Regardless, this is on deck for the rest of August and most of September for me. Long live Baltimore. Long live summer. And long live the Spaghett.Go there: Wet City BrewingExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendCocktailBaltimoreRead MorecookingIf You Can Open a Cheap Beer, You Can Make This CocktailBy Alison RomanRecipes you want to make.
