(Don\u2019t even think about wearing any other baseball uniform or hat.) Since it\u2019s close to the stadium, you\u2019ll find just as many customers wearing blue as cashiers in the front taking your order. The decor is a little drab, with fluorescent lights and brick-hued tables with wobbly stools, but you won\u2019t mind, or notice, once you get into that sandwich.PRACTICAL STUFF: Open every day: 6 a.m. to 10 p.m.\u2014Elyse InamineRen FullerWE ALSO LOVEBay Cities Italian Deli & BakerySuper Italian-style sandwiches in Santa MonicaLanger'sL.A.\u2019s unbeatable pastrami sandwich (sorry Katz's)Son of a GunThe seaside homage from L.A.\u2019s most dynamic chef duo (and home to a great chicken sandwich)Explore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
