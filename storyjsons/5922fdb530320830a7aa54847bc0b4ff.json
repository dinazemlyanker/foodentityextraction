It\u2019s the challenge that gave birth to wine charms, but a) I\u2019m using disposable cups, not wine glasses, and b) I am not especially cool, but I am definitely cooler than wine charms. In the past I\u2019ve asked guests to write their names on their cups, but unless you\u2019re standing guard by the bar, that directive gets lost pretty quickly. Plus I learned I have a lot of friends named Dan.So I deployed a strategy I picked up at a Friendsgiving a few weeks before: pre-labeling disposable cups with celebrities\u2019 names. It is now my new favorite party trick. Even the brainstorming was fun, as we threw out names we thought would be familiar to the group\u2014athletes, actors, politicians, musicians, writers, our new five-month-old baby\u2014then committed them to cups. We stacked these cups next to the cider, then waited to see just how unconfused people would be about their ownership.It worked. (Though not perfectly, I realized as I took a sip of what I was sure was my Ariana Grande cup, then discovered it was actually Aretha Franklin.)Beyond practicality, it was a legit highlight of the party. It was an icebreaker among people who didn\u2019t know each other (\u201cWho\u2019s on your cup?\u201d). And people were excited to talk about \u201ctheir\u201d celebrities. My friend Yaran told me repeatedly that he was upset he drew Les Moonves. I learned that Teddy has an inexplicable beef with Lin-Manuel Miranda. Laura was jealous that someone else had gotten RBG. Have you ever seen anyone get this animated over a wine charm?Explore Bon App\u00e9titEntertainingholiday2018Holiday DrinksRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
