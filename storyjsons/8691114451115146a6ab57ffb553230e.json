Henry Bohoskey\u2019s preferred harissa is New York Shuk brand\u2014it\u2019s thick, punchy, and just spicy enough\u2014but for bonus points go ahead and make your own. We like these saucy meatballs over mashed white beans, but they\u2019re also good with polenta or orzo.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

The meatballs as written were a bit bland, so we upped the salt, pepper, and garam masala quite a lot. We also added an egg and a scoop of yogurt to moisten them up and bind them together properly. I might add fresh breadcrumbs next time, too. The sauce was so simple that I didn't think it would work, but it did! Since the harissa is such a major part of the sauce, the one you choose can make a huge difference here. We used New York Shuk which is complex but pretty mild in heat, and also added a little bit of tomato paste for umami. We served the meatballs over polenta instead of beans. For a healthier version, I think it would work nicely with saut\u00e9ed kale!lasagnaqueenPortland, Oregon3/15/2022This meal is hearty and warm for a winter night but it was really spicy! I used 1/4 cup Trader Joe\u2019s harissa paste and had to tame down the heat with Greek yogurt. I would like to try it again with less heat so I could taste the flavors of the meatballs. I really liked the mashed beans as a base.Angela ACCentral Coast, CA3/1/2022Like another reviewer mentioned, the sauce was super oily. I would reduce the oil, and drain in between the meatballs and veggies. I also listened to another reviewer and upped the seasoning in the meatballs themselves. AmySeattle, WA1/25/2022Loved this recipe! The flavors in the harissa sauce were bold and flavorful but not over powering. Especially like the mashed beans with the sauce.Cherie FarrellDanville, CA1/6/2022I had high hopes for this one given the reviews but it was just ok to me. The coconut-harissa sauce was different, but not in a good way. The flavor profile seemed almost overpowered by the sumac. The meatballs themselves lacked flavor. Maybe I needed to punch up the garam masala or add chilies, but something was missing. Not a bad meal but not something I would ever make again. Shane New York, NY1/3/2022Warm, fiery, and filling! Perfect on a freezing winter night. Trader Joe\u2019s harissa did the job, but I imagine it is milder in flavor than other brands. I substituted ground pork for turkey, and even with a leaner meat the dish was a bit too rich, so I cut it with acid (fresh lime) like other reviews mention. AnonymousSeattle 12/30/2021Echoing other comments, I suspect the brand of harissa makes a big difference. Cooks should add two-thirds at first and adjust accordingly. We were fine with the heat but felt it lacked bright notes, so added a tsp of sumac to the sauce. I also upped the garlic and garam masala in the meatballs 50%. We did one can of beans (with the full compliment of spicing) and added rice as a side. Meatballs were with ground turkey and a 1/4 cup of panko to help with texture. Eric WDurham, NC12/25/2021Loved this recipe so much.. tweaked it a little, added extra sumac and a grated garlic clove to the beans because they were tasting a little bland.  Also added a couple of tablespoons of ketchup to the sauce at the very end after tasting and realizing I was looking for a little more acid and didn\u2019t have any tomato paste\u2014 the harissa I used could be the reason for that, every brand I\u2019ve ever tried has been so different from the last.  Can\u2019t wait to make it again and add some vegetables.. I\u2019m thinking spinach or peas AnonymousBrooklyn, NY12/18/2021Did anyone else have trouble with excess oil? I only could find Harissa sauce, not paste, but, it seems like the coconut oil is the true culprit. Now I'm skimming oil and will try to freeze some and remove from sauce. (Harissa sauce from TJs has olive oil in it- )and the color is nothing as deep as this recipe- hummmm? will try to find a paste or lower the coconut oil by a LOT.\nAnonymousSanta Monica CA12/11/2021This was delicious, but the brand of harissa must make a huge difference in the color of the sauce! Mine turned out quite beige/pinkish in the end so I was surprised at the bright-red color in the photo. Love the beans as a more interesting serving option than plain rice or pasta.Anonymous12/8/2021Flavorful, filling, fabulous! Every element (sauce, meatballs, beans) of this dish would taste great made separately - combine it all - delicious. In a pinch, I had to use ground beef but still tasty. Looking forward to eating the leftovers! Anonymous12/7/2021This is a great recipe with tons of flavor! It's nice to have a healthy base that isn't cauliflower. Easy to make this with pork or even with the Beyond meat substitute. I added mushrooms to the simmer and it was great. Also, if you can find a mild harissa it's nicer for those who can't handle as much spice. Would make this again for sure!BetsyDallas, TX12/6/2021Wow, amazing! \n\nI made minor tweaks but this is pretty perfect. I used 1lb ground beef, 1 lb ground turkey, onion instead shallots, 1 tbsp garam masala, 2 tbsps harrisa spice, instead of paste and 2 cans of coconut milk. Just because I was working with what was in my house. I also served it over buttery, smoky rice instead of beans!\n\nMy in-laws raved and my father in-law usually doesn't like \"fancy\" flavors.  Nika SMontana12/1/2021I'm so thankful for this cozy, cold weather recipe (especially the day after getting home from Thanksgiving with my little cousins' cold). I used it as a guide and raided the freezer and pantry- subbed ground lamb and wagyu for the pork and ranchero sauce for the harissa. Saut\u00e9ed sliced red peppers and cabbage before adding the coconut milk and served it over yellow peas. My sweetheart says, \"better write that one down!\" Thanks for a excellent inspo!LeahNantucket, Massachusetts11/30/2021Anything I can substitute sumac for? Can't seem to find it in the store around here. \nmahalogleekailua, HI11/30/2021Explore Bon App\u00e9titMeatballHarissaCondiments, Sauces & PastesCoconutFruitWeeknightEasyDinnerGround PorkPorkMeatCoconut MilkOther IngredientsGluten FreeRecipes you want to make.
