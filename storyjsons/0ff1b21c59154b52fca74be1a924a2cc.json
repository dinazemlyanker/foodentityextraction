Oats? I don\u2019t want a balanced breakfast in my coffee mug.By Ryan SmithJune 26, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Emma FishmanFacebookTwitterEmailA few years ago, on a sunny Los Angeles morning, my life changed forever\u2014or at least, my familiar morning routine did. I was at Sqirl in East Hollywood having breakfast (read: admiring all the beautiful people) and I asked for soy milk with my coffee. \u201cWe have almond milk!\u201d the waif-like Angeleno server chirped back. I froze. \u201cI\u2019ll, uh, take it\u2026. black.\u201dOver the course of the week, I found that I was in a soy milk no-man\u2019s land. Every caf\u00e9 in town had converted to almond milk. Over time, the affliction spread. Hip cafes in towns like Scottsdale and New Orleans had ditched my precious soy in favor of hemp or oat milk, as if they could differentiate themselves by the alternatives they offered. Even my local spot in the East Village had moved on to almond and oat. I was really starting to appreciate drinking my coffee black, the way I should have been drinking it all along, I\u2019m sure.Over the past few years, various health concerns have spooked many long-time soy drinkers into seeking out something healthier. \u201cExcess amounts of soy mimics estrogen production which causes estrogen levels to rise, which can feed into prostate cancer and breast cancer,\u201d explains Monika Arenas, a Miami-based nutritionist and \u201cgrocery guru\u201d for the Carillon Wellness Resort in Miami Beach. \u201cEveryone is looking for other alternatives that aren\u2019t going to mimic the body\u2019s natural activity.\u201dRecently I've watched as even almond milk is phased out in favor of alternatives. Walking down the aisle of dairy-free \u201cmilks\u201d at Whole Foods is exhausting. Rice, hemp, flax, cashew: It feels like every month, we\u2019re on to the next new milk trend.But is it so wrong to keep wanting to drink soy? Here's what I know: It makes my amazing coffee taste even better. Almond could never compete\u2014it made my coffee taste like cardboard, plus, Arenas warns, it takes excessive amounts of water to produce just one gallon of the stuff. Hemp should only be for making necklaces. Oats? I don\u2019t want a balanced breakfast in my coffee mug. My day just isn\u2019t right if I don\u2019t start out with a bit of soy creamer\u2014basically the soy version of half and half\u2014in my cup.My solution? I\u2019ve started packing little 3 oz. bottles of soy with me wherever I go. I am, however, willing to give one alternative a shot. Arenas recommends a homemade creamer made with unsweetened coconut milk, coconut oil, coconut sugar, and a touch of vanilla and cinnamon. For me, the coconut milk is the closest texturally to soy, and it\u2019s just sweet enough. So call me a coconut convert for now, but I\u2019ll always have a travel bottle of soy stashed in my bag\u2014just in case.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishDairy-FreeMilkSoyTrendsRead MoreLifestyle4 Non-Dairy Milks We Love Besides AlmondBy Ashley MasonRecipes you want to make.
