Here\u2019s What Tastes BestIt\u2019s me, your soy sommelier.By Karen YuanJanuary 15, 2022FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Isa Zapata, Prop Styling by Paige HicksFacebookTwitterEmailAll products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Like so many Chinese families, my parents and I almost always drank soy milk for breakfast. We weren\u2019t lactose intolerant. We didn\u2019t think soy milk had any magical benefits. We just knew it tasted best, especially when hot and freshly ground, like coffee. (Yes, at eight I was already a snob about nondairy milks. No, I didn\u2019t grow up in Brooklyn!)Nowadays I\u2019m more tolerant of the various types of milk out there. But I still drink nondairy milks just for the taste\u2014and I\u2019m obsessed with trying out all the nutty, beany blends and origins. After a lifetime of playing soy sommelier, I\u2019ve homed in on the best nondairy milks\u2014not based on alleged health properties or sustainability claims, but purely on taste. I can\u2019t compare apples almonds and oranges oats, so I\u2019ve named the best nondairy milk for lattes, cereal, smoothies, and all our other favorite ways to drink mylks, malks, and m\u00fclks.The Best Milk for LattesThis faintly tastes like\u2026chocolate. I\u2019m not kidding. Sproud\u2019s Original Pea Milk does not taste like peas\u2014instead, it has a vaguely bittersweet aftertaste that kind of reminds me of cacao. For some, it might be a little unusual to drink on its own, but I\u2019ve discovered that a warm cup of coffee plus splashes of pea milk tastes almost like mocha, or at least like someone\u2019s gently whispered the word \u201cmocha\u201d into the drink while brewing it. It\u2019s nice.Sproud Dairy-Free Milk$5 at Target$30 at Amazon (6-pack)The Best Milk for SmoothiesMilk goes in smoothies and hemp seed goes in smoothies, so Good Mylk\u2019s Hemp Mylk is a double whammy. It tastes strong and earthy and really rich when blended with cacao powder, bananas, dates, and honey. The brand actually provides the milk as a concentrate (in a bag, fun) that you stir into water, so it\u2019s a DIY hemp milk. I\u2019ve found this quasi-homemade version to taste a bit textured and gritty, but I\u2019m the kind of person who likes orange juice crammed with pulp, so I enjoy it.Good Mylk Hemp Mylk$60 at Good Mylk$83 at Amazon (6-pack)The Best Milk for Drinking in a Whole Damn GlassWow, Minor Figures's Barista Oat. I could drink a bathtub of it. How does water and oats taste like this??? Its texture is so creamy, and it tastes like cow\u2019s milk amped up with a hint of natural sweetness. I\u2019ve maniacally added this to everything, including coffee, cereal, and tea. At one point I found myself drinking more coffee just so I could drink more of this milk and realized that was a very bad way to be. Then I realized I could just drink the milk all by itself, and my life has never been the same since.Minor Figures Oat Milk$32 at Amazon (6-pack)$32 at Amazon (2-pack)The Best Milk for Dunking CookiesWilla\u2019s Creamy Oat Milk features whole grain oats, so it\u2019s full of protein and fiber and light on sugar\u2014one cup includes fewer than three grams. And because it uses the whole oat, it\u2019s also zero waste! Drink this oat milk to feel like a good person. As for its taste, the mouthfeel is super smooth and creamy, and because it\u2019s less sweet than other oat milks, I\u2019ve discovered it\u2019s perfect for dunking Oreos, chocolate chip cookies, and any funky sugary cookies left over from the holidays (okay, maybe not the last one if you want to live).Willa\u2019s Organic Oat Milk$7 at Hive$10 at Amazon$40 at Willa's Kitchen (6-Pack)The Best Milk for OatmealsThis is rich and nutty and transforms a regular bowl of oatmeal into an enigmatic dish layered with flavor and secrets. I like adding almonds and all sorts of nuts to my oatmeal or muesli, so Elmhurst\u2019s Unsweetened Milked Almonds brings me halfway there. I top my bowl with extra nuts and berries so I\u2019m basically eating trail mix for breakfast. Like Willa\u2019s, Elmhurst\u2019s production process is also zero waste.Elmhurst Unsweetened Milked Almonds$6 at Hive$5 at Thrive Market$40 at Amazon (6-pack)The Best Milk for CerealsThis is the OG. Silk\u2019s Organic Unsweetened Soy Milk is the nondairy milk I grew up drinking, and at this point, it\u2019s a comfort bev. It doesn\u2019t have fancy packaging or ingredients, but it\u2019ll always be there for me. I don\u2019t eat cereal that much, but when I do have a bowl of Kashi or Cinnamon Toast Crunch (more likely the latter tbh), this milk completes it. It tastes very mild and very creamy and very nostalgic. When I just want a taste of home, this is the one.Silk Unsweetened Organic Soymilk$16 at Amazon (6-pack)Explore Bon App\u00e9titCultureLifestyleShoppingRecipes you want to make.
