Abiodun Henderson had agreed to make sauce for a dinner benefiting her Atlanta-based social enterprise, The Come Up Project, and the day of the dinner had arrived, sauce-less.\u201cIt was last minute,\u201d Henderson recalls, laughing. \u201cI went to Dekalb Farmers Market and just picked up a whole bunch of random seasonings: lavender, turmeric, muscovado sugar. I had never even heard of muscovado sugar.\u201dThough she\u2019d worked in restaurants for well over a decade, Henderson\u2019s jobs had always been front of house, not in the kitchen. But she did some internet research and worked off a few recipes she found on YouTube. Riffing with the more unexpected ingredients, she added plenty of habanero and cayenne peppers for heat, rounded it all out with a reliable base of onions, garlic, and apple cider vinegar. The result? A fragrant, fiery blend the color of Georgia clay that somehow tastes great on everything.\u201cIt\u2019s a super blast of tropical, pungent heat, but it finishes very clean and a touch sweet,\u201d says our highly discerning (read: very picky) senior food editor, Chris Morocco, noting how subtle hints of lavender back up the intense heat of the habanero. \u201cHonestly, you could just literally spoon it into your mouth.\u201dGangstas to Growers' Sweet Sol hot sauce.\nPhoto by Emma FishmanA few weeks after the charity dinner, Henderson and her team were brainstorming ways to help fund the Come Up Project\u2019s core program, Gangstas to Growers, which seeks to reduce recidivism in formerly incarcerated youth (statistically, more than 50 percent of young people end up back in the system within three years of release) by teaching them an array of important life skills. The program\u2019s approach is holistic, but much of the work revolves around agriculture and food\u2014Henderson partners with SWAG Co-op, a Southwest Atlanta farmers\u2019 organization dedicated to sustainable urban food systems, along with other food businesses and restaurants around the city. After graduating, classes of six to ten trainees, ranging in age from 18 to 24, are placed into jobs and externships around the city.\u201cThe original idea was for the young people to come up with a product we could sell,\u201d Henderson says. \u201cWe were deciding between tomato sauce or hot sauce. Then Beyonc\u00e9 came out with her song, you know, \u2018hot sauce in my bag, swag,\u2019 and that was it. Beyonc\u00e9 decided for us.\u201dGangstas to Growers trainees came up with the sauce\u2019s name, Sweet Sol, during a marketing workshop, and they gather weekly at a church kitchen in Atlanta\u2019s West End to make it. Henderson and her team started off peddling the sauce at local events and farmers markets, but it now ships nationwide through the Come Up Project\u2019s website.Born and raised in Brooklyn, Henderson experienced the fruits of activism early, and the struggles, too. Her mom\u2014a Liberian-born social worker, educator, and entrepreneur who started both a school and an employment agency for immigrant women\u2014died of AIDS-related complications when Henderson was 14. Her dad, a \u201crank and file Black Panther member,\u201d passed when she was 29, eight days before the start of the Occupy movement.Henderson was working as a waitress at an Atlanta airport restaurant when her father died, and the news sparked something in her. She took the money she\u2019d inherited and joined the thousands that had gathered on D.C.\u2019s National Mall for Occupy Congress. There she met Malik Rhasaan of the offshoot group Occupy the Hood, which seeks to centralize the strife of underserved black communities. \u201cI looked at all the signs, like, who am I supposed to be?\u201d Henderson says. \u201cI\u2019m supposed to be doing this work.\u201dHenderson returned to Atlanta and homed in on her own neighborhood, Westview, where rapid development had begun to displace predominantly black residents en masse. She enrolled in a training program with an urban agriculture center called Truly Living Well and upon graduating took over a defunct community garden, where she started teaching basic growing skills to local kids. In 2016 she turned her attention to the older set, and piloted Gangstas to Growers. \u201cI found my organizer family within the farmers,\u201d she says. \u201cIn my experience, the folks in local food movements are the most grounded, the most void of ego, the most thoughtful about how we can really be liberated and what this work should look like.\u201dToday, Henderson is halfway through her second class of trainees and focused on securing investment for a hot sauce production facility and creating partnerships with local food businesses in Atlanta so they can one day employ Gangstas to Growers graduates. Her ultimate goal is to build a local food cooperative that can train and employ everyone who wants to get involved. \u201cComing from Occupy the Hood, that\u2019s what we\u2019re about: one hood at a time, block by block,\u201d she says. \u201cBlack folks got the answers, we just need the resources.\u201dBuy SweetSol Hot Sauce, $8All products featured on Healthyish are independently selected by our editors.
