Cantonese dishes don\u2019t have the heat of Sichuan or Hunan cooking, and it was only many years later, after he moved to New York, that Som came to appreciate the wide range of Asian cuisines that balance heat and sweet. The combination of Korean gochujang, maple syrup, and brown butter creates that ideal union in this side dish, a staple at his Thanksgiving table. If you can\u2019t find gochujang (he likes the one from Mother-in-Law's brand), Som suggests using 2\u20133 Tbsp. Sriracha instead.For the rest of Som\u2019s Thanksgiving menu, see his recipes for Asian Pear Salad With Peanut-Lime Dressing, Sweet Potato Tian, Dutch Oven No Mai Fan, Char Siu Wellington, and Milk Tea Bread Pudding With Cr\u00e8me Anglaise.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Roast, rotating baking sheets top to bottom and front to back halfway through, until brussels sprouts are charred in spots and tender, 16\u201318 minutes.Step 2Meanwhile, if using walnuts, toast in a dry medium skillet over medium heat, tossing often, until fragrant and slightly darkened, about 4 minutes. Transfer to a small bowl and let cool.Step 3Cook butter in a small saucepan over medium-low heat, swirling occasionally, until milk solids are a deep amber color and butter smells very nutty, 5\u20138 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in gochujang and maple syrup. Season with kosher salt and pepper.Step 4Combine brussels sprouts, half of walnuts, and half of scallions in reserved bowl; add brown butter mixture and toss to coat.

Don\u2019t leave out the lemon zest - it adds a fresh finish to a spicy/sweet/crunchy/gooey dish. Anonymous12/11/2021This recipe was so delicious that my guests were putting the extra sauce on everything and begging for more.  I added lemon peel and the juice of peel of half a lemon.  Didn't use all the sauce on the sprouts, seemed like too much but it was used up!! Have made it numerous times, with and without the walnuts.  It's a keeper! I air- fried the sprouts last time and worked well too.AnonymousLakeport CA12/7/2021My mouth had a party! I could taste the layers of flavors, the nutty butter, maple syrup, onion, toasted nuts, lemon zest and of course the gochujang. This was so, so, good. Every time a recipe calls for \u201croasted\u201d my brain translates to burned and dried out so I covered the Brussel sprouts and baked on 375 for about 25 min. I chopped the pecans, finely chopped the onions (didn\u2019t have walnuts and ate the scallions the night before) and once the gochujang was flavored and the butter separated I poured off most of the butter because it was too much; the nutty butter flavor remained. \n\nI put everything in a bowl and tossed! I'll make this dish for Christmas and will add more lemon zest. Again, so, so good!\nAndiWashington, DC12/4/2021Fantastic combination of flavors! I never thought of gochujian and Brussel sprouts, but when combined with the butter and maple syrup, my taste buds exploded and did the happy dance!DebbieKBarrington IL11/29/2021Absolutely delicious! Made these for thanksgiving this year, and they were a favorite of all who came. I did add a splash of rice wine vinegar to the sauce, and also used crushed peanuts instead of walnuts. Delicious and easy to make. LoulouChicago, IL11/26/2021This came together quickly on a weeknight and was well received. Subbed honey for maple in a pinch. Served with miso mashed potatoes also featured in this months issue. \n\nIf I could add one thing it would be crunch. Maybe crispy shallots on top or pork katsu on the side. CambroWestport WA11/18/2021Without a doubt, absolutely delicious.  Easy prep. The spice is subtle (I used Sirachi). Presentation is decadent.  I lined a no-rim cookie sheet with parchment.  Saves on clean up.  My test kitchen (my family) gave it 2 thumbs up for Thanksgiving.RedheadChicago, IL11/15/2021I followed the advice of previous reviews and added rice vinegar to the sauce. I also used extra lemon zest and extra scallions after combining the sauce and brussels. This was saucier than I was expecting but that's not a bad thing. I used Mother-In-Law's \"extra spicy\" gochujang and the sauce definitely had a kick but it wasn't too much. Will make again!Killer_BeetsAtlanta, GA11/12/2021Saw the previous review saying this recipe needed some acid so I mixed in some rice vinegar which also helped to thin the sauce a little. Never cooked brussels sprouts at this high of a temp but turned out great.AnonymousMorgantown, WV11/4/2021Made as written sans optional walnuts.  Taste buds wanted a touch of acid in the gochujang brown butter sauce so used a splash of Rancho Gordo pineapple vinegar but lemon juice or other would have worked too.  Used more lemon zest than specified to finish.  Will use more scallions next time.
