She cooks, he serves\u2014looking tidy and welcoming in a folded apron\u2014and they do it all at Haroo, a quirky upstairs space at the end of Richmond\u2019s Alexandra Road (nicknamed Food Street for its plethora of restaurants).ORDER THE: delightfully crisp seafood pancake; cheese tteokbokki in targin (Korean rice cakes smothered in a smoky, spicy tomato sauce and topped with cheese); and bibimbap with all the banchan. But for a crowd, the special flower-shaped bibimbap is really great: layers of rice, bulgogi, kimchi, and vegetables are pressed into a flower-shaped mold, which is removed before an elaborate display of garnishes are added on top.THE VIBE IS: down-home Korean grandmother with quaint curtains and apple-print pillows. Diners predominantly include young couples and groups of friends in the know. If there\u2019s music, it\u2019s barely audible; instead, it\u2019s all about the quiet enjoyment of food and friendly service.PRACTICAL STUFF: Open Tuesday to Sunday, from 5 p.m. to 10 p.m. Closed Monday. Reservations welcome by phone.\u2014Lindsay AndersonGrant HarderGrant HarderWE ALSO LOVEMaenamReinvented Thai cuisine (and cocktails) in Kitsilano   Vij\u2019sGame-changing Indian cuisine and hospitality in Cambie since 1994Caf\u00e9 MedinaThe city\u2019s downtown brunch institutionExplore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
