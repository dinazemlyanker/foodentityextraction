So I tried it.By Alex BeggsNovember 30, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Chelsie CraigFacebookTwitterEmailI went to a beauty event recently for a new Goop product called GOOPGENES. It\u2019s an orange collagen drink that's supposed to make you have everlasting plump skin and stuff. This story is not about that at all. STAY WITH ME THO. At the event, I sat next to a lovely (everyone was lovely, everything was lovely, the drink was ...fishy) beauty writer who told me her skincare routine is now all CBD. \u201cHow does your face feel?\u201d I asked. \u201cVery relaxed,\u201d she said. Whoa. On the other side of me, an editor cut a sliver from an already sliced kiwi and took a tiny bite.The main element of this lady\u2019s CBD routine, she told me, is a new face oil from the well-designed, plant-friendly brand Herbivore. It's called Emerald because it\u2019s green, get it? You know what else is green? Weed, kids. However! There is no CBD or THC in this specific product. It\u2019s hemp seed oil, scientific name: cannabis sativa. This is good marketing.So obviously I had to try it. Every morning and night for about two weeks, I squeezed four to six drops from the minimalist dropper bottle, massaged it into my cheeks, and studied the results. My dehydrated skin, a victim of the desert conditions in my radiator-heated apartment, soaked up the oil desperately. Emerald really smells like weed. My face smells like weed. It was jarring at first, and then it would fade, especially if I layered another moisturizer on top. Herbivore suggests their Pink Cloud Creme, which has a light, rose-coconut scent that diminishes the hemp reek. After a week of use, I noticed my skin was definitely moisturized, soft, smooth, and clear of zits. But was I glowing like a rotisserie chicken, my true beauty icon? I might call it \u201cshiny.\u201dI wanted to understand how Emerald actually works, so I called licensed medical esthetician and skincare guru Jordana Mattioli (I avidly follow her on IG for legit product reviews and her walkthroughs of the drugstore beauty aisle), and she broke down the ingredient list\u2014the power players and the not-so-hot.Hemp seed oil. \u201cHemp seed\u2019s awesome. Hemp has been around the block for years,\u201d Mattioli said. Hemp seed oil is packed with Omegas 3, 6, and 9, which are \u201cgamma linolenic acids,\u201d and while that sounds like some Star Trek shit, it just means it\u2019s super moisturizing and won\u2019t clog pores. However, it might not soak into the skin very fast, she noted, which explains why I felt shiny versus glowy. \u201cGlow is light reflecting off face,\u201d Mattioli reminded me; I really need to stop talking about it like it comes from within.Ashwagandha, turmeric root, shiitake mushrooms. That\u2019s right, there are adaptogens here too. Touting mushrooms in skincare is a sign of the times, (not to say that the ingredients and herbs themself are new\u2014they\u2019re ancient); it just hasn\u2019t been studied extensively yet in the ol\u2019 journals of medicine. For that reason, it\u2019s hard to say if the shiitake in the product is the cause for say, reducing inflammation, more so than other ingredients also present. \u201cStress and inflammation, that\u2019s where adaptogens come into play,\u201d said Mattioli. \u201cI don\u2019t think [adaptogens in skincare are] harmful, and we know how awesome they are when taken internally, so I\u2019m all for anything that would help reduce stress in the skin.\u201dSqualane is first in the ingredient list, meaning it\u2019s the major player. Squalane is a hydrocarbon that\u2019s found in your own skin as well as in plants, which is how Herbivore gets it in Emerald. Plant-based squalane is \u201ctotally safe and fine,\u201d Mattioli told me. Also: super-hydrating. A-ha.Essential oils. \u201cThe only thing I don\u2019t love are the essential oils,\u201d Mattioli said. They\u2019re used to add fragrance, and in Herbivore\u2019s marketing, chill-vibe aromatherapy from the scent of hemp. Essential oils are sort of a misnomer, because these aren\u2019t oily like olive or coconut or jojoba. They\u2019re actually super-concentrated extractions of plants that can be very volatile, especially citrus oils, and can include high-proof alcohols that might preserve flower essences successfully but sting your skin. \u201cSome [essential oils] are more intense than others. For the general population, and my clients, when someone has skin issues, I say cut out all potential irritants like essential oils. Hemp seed oil is fine for everyone, but this product wouldn't be my go-to [because of the essential oils].\u201d So make sure you try it on your skin by doing a patch test before slathering your face, especially if you have sensitive skin or have had reactions to products with essential oils before (I have\u2014a mask made my face break into a full-on red, burning fire but the essential oils in Emerald didn\u2019t irritate me.)\u201cWe have to remember,\u201d Mattioli concluded, \u201cthere\u2019s so much benefit in companies taking the first step and including these new ingredients. Innovation is important. The adaptogen component is really cool. I just want to make sure claims are taken with a grain of salt. Nothing is a miracle product, and when it is, trust me, we will all know about it.\u201d I\u2019ll remain all ears.Buy it: EMERALD Deep Moisture Glow Oil, $48 from HerbivoreAll products featured on Healthyish are independently selected by our editors.
