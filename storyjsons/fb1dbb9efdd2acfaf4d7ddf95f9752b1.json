The cause of eating more cookies. When Alison Roman's Dining In cookbook came out in October, she told Grub Street about these cookies\u2014buttery, shortbread-like, rolled in crunchy Demerara sugar:  \u201cIn the book, I only have one cookie recipe,\" she said, \"and it\u2019s for these salted butter-chocolate-chunk shortbreads that are, in my opinion, way better than a chocolate chip cookie. So I ate a bunch of cookie dough before 10 a.m., because you need to know if it\u2019s good before you bake.\u201dA cookie craze was in motion.The official recipe name is: Salted Butter and Chocolate Chunk Shortbread or Why Would I Make Another Chocolate Chip Cookie Ever Again?Roman writes in Dining In that traditional chocolate chip cookies are \u201cdeeply flawed\u201d\u2014a hot take!\u2014and that her recipe aims to solve all the things that bothered her about them. The salted butter has a \u201cdeeper saltiness than using just salt\u201d and the shortbread dough has barely enough flour to hold everything together, while chocolate cut into chunks prevents \u201cchip congregation.\u201dInstagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Cookie season came in December, and Roman started noticing that more and more people were making the cookies. By now,\nshe\u2019s been tagged in over 200 photos, easy, she told me. Eater and Refinery29 posted the recipe, and just last week, Smitten Kitchen's Deb Perelman made them and hinted that they might just be Cookie of the Year.Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Perelman told me why she thinks the cookie is a sensation: \u201cWe\u2019ve had years of sea salt flecked everything, many things that we wish weren\u2019t. It\u2019s an accent, an apology. But salt lifts flavor, and salted butter tastes more aged (cured) and developed. This cookie has gravitas.\u201d It\u2019s easy, with few ingredients, and the compact shape makes it pack up and travel well (to parties), she added. Oh, and: \u201cYou can really taste the butter first here. What\u2019s the first thing you taste in a traditional chocolate chip cookie? Brown sugary softness?\u201dEater senior editor Daniela Galarza made the cookies and told me: \u201dI think this rejection of the overblown, very complicated cookie recipe that needs aging and a million ingredients is interesting. Roman honed in on a moment in which going back to basics: butter, sugar, salt, chocolate\u2014is a welcome respite.\u201dNow Roman wakes up to 10-20 notifications of tags on Instagram of people cooking from the book, about half of which are the cookies. She screenshots their stories and posts them on her own so that following her seems like an endless stream of cookie madness, \ud83c\udf6a \ud83d\ude0d emojis, and !!! The coin shape, the sugar crust, even if some people's are...lumpier than others...you can immediately recognize the cookies.Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\u201dThese are now in my top 10 best cookies i've ever made\u201d a commenter wrote on Instagram.\u201cNOT VEGAN but oh so good\u201d wrote, presumably, a part-time vegan.\u201cIf you buy @alisonroman's #diningincookbook and don\u2019t make salted butter chocolate chunk shortbread, do you even Instagram?\u201d \u2014 that one sort of confused me.\u201cwouldn\u2019t be December 2017 home baking without @alisonroman's instantly classic shortbread\u201d wrote someone who lives by a cookie calendar.\u201ccookies > Clif bars\u201d wrote a fan skiing in Deer Valley, who Instagrammed the cookie in front of a snowy mountain scene with her glittery manicure.Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.But one person wasn\u2019t happy about it.A cranky follower sent Roman a direct message along the lines of: \u201cI love your work and your feed, but please, enough with the cookies.\u201d\u201cAs if I would give one sh*t!\u201d she laughed. Then she put together an all-cookie story, 50 slides of cookies cookies cookies.\u201cPeople DM me all the time, how do I get them more round, like everyone else? I\u2019m like, don\u2019t even stress about that, part of the beauty of the cookie is that it\u2019s irregular, that\u2019s why I like to use chocolate chunks and not chips, I like how natural and real it looks. They all look different but taste delicious, they all have their own cookie personality. That\u2019s why I like sharing them, it empowers people to know they can look like this, or like that.\u201dThe cookbook is sold out on Amazon! (It will be restocked\u2014the fourth printing!\u2014on January 12th or 14th.) Meanwhile, find it at Barnes and Noble Sign up for her newsletter here, and then keep an eye out for her next cookbook, which she\u2019s about to start working on...And FINALLY, here\u2019s the recipe:Salted Butter and Chocolate Chunk ShortbreadLess chocolate chip cookie, more brown sugar shortbread with chocolate chunks\u2014these cookies have started an Instagram craze.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titCookbooksCookieShortbreadRead Morerecipes99 Christmas Cookies to Fire up the Festive SpiritGallery99 SlidesBy Mehreen Karimrecipes47 Easy Cookie Recipes You\u2019ll Make on RepeatGallery47 SlidesBy Alyse WhitneycookingHow to Tell When Literally Every Baked Good Is DoneBy Claire SaffitzcookingBreakfast Cookies Are the Reason We're Getting Up In the MorningBy Chris MoroccoRecipes you want to make.
