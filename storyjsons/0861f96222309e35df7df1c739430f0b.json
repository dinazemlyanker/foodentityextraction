A few blocks away it's a different story.\u00a0By Priya KrishnaJanuary 21, 2021FacebookTwitterEmailThe outdoor dining setup at Spicy Shallot in the Elmhurst neighborhood of QueensPhoto by Laura MurrayFacebookTwitterEmailThis past summer, on any remotely pleasant Saturday night, Vanderbilt Avenue in Brooklyn\u2019s Prospect Heights neighborhood was a full-on block party. The street was shut down to vehicular traffic. People laid red-and-white-checked picnic blankets on the streets. Others lazily sipped gin cocktails outside Weather Up. The restaurants along the avenue, places like Olmsted, Alta Calidad, and Chuko, served plates of glistening spareribs and oversize bowls of miso ramen to packed tables of customers on sidewalks, under the glint of string lights, surrounded by umbrellas, snake plants, and beds of artificial turf.A few blocks over, on Nostrand Avenue in Crown Heights, it was a different story. There were plenty of open restaurants, but none were busy. Cars zoomed up and down the street. Chairs and tables were minimally stationed outside but with few decorative accents. No string lights, no artificial turf, but the food spoke for itself, from the thickly crusted jerk chicken at Peppa\u2019s to the grilled shrimp skewers stained with tamarind sauce at La \u00d1apa, a tapas bar.\u201cIt does feel pretty dead,\u201d Francisco Anton, chef-owner of La \u00d1apa, messaged me one August evening. He added that his neighbors were heading to Vanderbilt to hang out.Last June, New York City\u2019s mayor, Bill de Blasio, announced an outdoor dining program that\u2019s now become a permanent fixture of the city despite the fickle opening and closing of indoor dining. For many struggling restaurants, it's been a lifeline. But not for Anton. The $10,000 he was quoted by an architect for an outdoor build-out is more than his small family-run restaurant can afford. And in November, the city sent out new guidelines requiring roadway barriers and at least two open sides for outdoor booths. Anton says the cost of an insulated, well-designed outdoor dining setup is the same as opening a second restaurant.There are other factors too: Anton says street cleaning doesn\u2019t happen frequently on his block, resulting in clogged storm drain grates and dirty sidewalks. And during the heightened tensions in June, the city removed trash cans from his block and other neighborhoods in the city to prevent people from throwing them into storefronts, which has caused an increase in street waste. Nostrand is also a major avenue with tons of traffic, and its express Select Bus Service route would make it ineligible for Open Streets, the program that allowed restaurateurs along Vanderbilt Avenue to expand their business beyond the sidewalk. \u201cNo one is going to want to sit outside with a bunch of gray snow to eat at my restaurant,\u201d he says. \u201cThey will go to neighborhoods that are better kept by the city.\u201dRestaurants are an aesthetics-driven business. Design and atmosphere set the tone for a meal before any food arrives at the table. But hiring a designer means ponying up for fees and materials in an industry with single-digit margins. And in New York City, where socioeconomic divisions run deep, rents are sky-high, and one-third of small businesses are expected to close because of the pandemic, many restaurants lack the infrastructure and financing that their high-end counterparts do. And many of those restaurants are run by immigrants and Black and brown communities and are located in under-resourced neighborhoods. Outdoor dining\u2014and the winter\u2014has made these inequities even worse.In the 10014 zip code, which covers the affluent and nearly 73 percent white Greenwich Village, an estimated 64 percent of restaurants are open for outdoor dining (according to data calculated by dividing the number of restaurants open in a zip code, per the Department of Transportation, over the number of restaurants in that zip code, per the NYC Department of Health). By contrast, in the 11213 zip code of Crown Heights\u2014a majority Black neighborhood where the average salary is $35,000\u2014just 16 percent of restaurants are open for outdoor dining. This speaks, in part, to the lack of access to design resources that would allow owners to make their restaurants compliant with city regulations and reopen, says Sreoshy Banerjea, the assistant vice president of urban design for the New York City Economic Development Corporation.Banerjea helped start Design Corps, a recent partnership between NYCxDESIGN, a global design festival in New York City, and the New York City Economic Development Corporation to offer pro bono design assistance to restaurants. So far, 50 restaurants have applied to the program\u2014many seeking help with weatherproof setups\u2014and there aren\u2019t enough volunteer architects to meet the demand.Other organizations doing similar work include the Van Alen Institute\u2019s Neighborhoods Now, which connects design firms with businesses in neighborhoods hardest hit by the pandemic, and Design Advocates, an organization of architects offering pro bono design services to small businesses in New York City in need, including restaurants like La \u00d1apa, whose setup is still in process.Michael Chen, one of the cofounders of Design Advocates (and the founder of his own architecture firm, Michael K Chen), says there\u2019s a huge gap in understanding of government regulations around outdoor dining, especially among restaurateurs who can\u2019t afford lawyers but also can\u2019t afford to temporarily close. Often, these are small restaurants in under-resourced neighborhoods operating day-to-day, without elaborate business models. A big part of Chen\u2019s work is just translating the legalese and coming up with solutions to help restaurants avoid receiving violations (Design Advocates is currently working on plans for plastic partitions, heated seats, and overhead electric heaters that can be made affordably and installed easily). Other barriers include language, technology, and physical street space available, adds Val Hoffman, the program director for NYCxDESIGN.The outdoor dining setup that Design Advocates is currently working on for La \u00d1apa will definitely be a game changer, according to Anton. With 31 seats, it\u2019ll help him to hire back many of his workers, largely immigrants who he says were unable to receive unemployment. But it\u2019s taking time to design, and it keeps getting more expensive as winter creeps in, with the cost of heaters and air curtains. He\u2019s not sure when the outdoor installation will be up and running and must rely on takeout and delivery in the meantime.Photo by Laura MurrayMouna Thiam, the owner of Le Paris Dakar, a French Senegalese caf\u00e9 with three locations in Bed-Stuy, says that if Design Advocates hadn\u2019t offered to help, she wouldn\u2019t have any outdoor dining. She was initially quoted $8,000 without the furniture for a build-out by another design firm, and her restaurants are making half the revenue they were before the pandemic. Her outdoor setup, which includes pale pink umbrellas and big bunches of daisies, brought in meaningful business over the summer, though she can\u2019t afford heat lamps right now.\u00a0But access to design resources like these don\u2019t resolve existing inequities in these communities. Even if she were offered help, Cassandre Davilmar, who owns Lakou Caf\u00e9, a Haitian-American restaurant in Weeksville, Brooklyn, isn\u2019t sure she could make outdoor dining work in her neighborhood.\u201cWe are on Utica, which is a pretty congested area, and we are not one of those streets with a huge sidewalk,\u201d she says. She initially saw outdoor dining as \u201ca hindrance in the neighborhood, taking up parking spots in an already congested area.\u201d Like on Nostrand, there isn\u2019t much street cleaning along Utica. \u201cThere is a lot of trash rolling down the street,\u201d Davilmar adds.On top of this, her neighborhood was one of those hardest hit by the COVID-19 virus. \u201cDo I really want to encourage folks to sit outside when we were a coronavirus hot spot?\u201d she asks. Still, she set up four tables on the sidewalk with umbrellas, plants, and tents. \u201cWe are one of the few places in the neighborhood that was a sit-down spot, so I don\u2019t want us to just do takeout,\u201d she says. But the wind knocked over the plants and broke the umbrellas and tents. She put in a request with Open Streets to get her street shut down to traffic on weekends, like Vanderbilt Avenue, but it was denied because of the location along a major bus line. \u201cI was like, \u2018There are bus lines on Vanderbilt,\u2019\u201d she says.\u201cIt is hard, because we deserve nice things, too,\u201d Davilmar explains, \u201cbut at the same time all those structural inequities cause things to hit us harder and make us be more cautious. It is a lose-lose situation.\u201dJames Lam\u2019s restaurant, Spicy Shallot, which he co-owns with his wife, Inthira Lam, is situated in Elmhurst in Queens, another area devastated by the virus. He was able to set up outdoor dining with partitions, thanks to a friend who is a contractor. But he says many people in the area aren\u2019t able to do much more than some outdoor tables and chairs, and the neighborhood hasn\u2019t fully recovered from being a virus epicenter. Customers outside the neighborhood are hesitant to visit. Still, the restaurant\u2019s basic setup has been helpful\u2014revenue is up 30 percent.Some restaurateurs fear that setting up outdoor dining might open themselves up to unwanted scrutiny. Abigail Coover Hume, a board member at Design Advocates, has noticed that enforcement of outdoor dining guidelines has been inconsistent among different neighborhoods. Restaurants in under-resourced neighborhoods are receiving violations that she doesn\u2019t see those in more affluent neighborhoods getting. (Joseph Yacca, the Director of Operations for the Department of Transportation\u2019s Highway Inspections & Quality Assurance unit, refuted this.)At La \u00d1apa, Anton has put up a chain-and-post barrier to separate his restaurant from the lengthy line at the UPS store next door and to prevent people from blocking the door of his restaurant. He hasn\u2019t even set up outdoor dining, yet the restaurant has received three violations.To drum up business, he collaborated with other restaurants in the neighborhood to run a 10 percent discount across the board. Other places are discussing sharing resources such as heat lamps. But the challenges seem greater than what grassroots initiatives can accomplish.\u201cI haven\u2019t seen anything large-scale that would really alleviate those pressures on a systemic level,\u201d Chen says, referring to the unequal distribution of city resources across neighborhoods, the barriers to capital and funding that restaurateurs without Rolodexes of investors face. \u201cWe are cobbling together the resources we can on a case by case basis.\u201dAnton agrees, fearing that without government funding for small businesses and better unemployment benefits for the general public, small independent restaurants like his, which make up the backbone of the industry, will not be able to survive. And with a slumping economy, he adds, \u201cEven if we have a beautiful, warm, and cozy structure outside, even if we have no COVID, people will not come out and spend.\u201d\u201cPeople like me, like my family, this is all we have,\u201d he continues. \u201cWe don\u2019t have money behind us, pushing a brand or pushing a book deal or pushing a TV show. We just like working every day and making the money, so we can have a decent life or whatever we can afford.\u201dOutdoor dining has become more than a way to seat more guests and make more money\u2014it\u2019s become a symbol of systemic inequity long ingrained in the city. And it\u2019s no longer a design solution but a burden in itself.\u201cRight now, we are not caring about aesthetics,\u201d Banerjea says, \u201cbecause it is about survival.\u201dExplore Bon App\u00e9titRestaurantsNew York CityDesignRecipes you want to make.
