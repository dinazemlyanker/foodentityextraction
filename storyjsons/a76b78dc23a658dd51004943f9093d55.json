It\u2019s a grim scene, and, unfortunately, I\u2019ve been there a lot. What makes it even grimmer is when the fruits and vegetables staring back at me are on their deathbeds: lackluster greens, molding berries, and avocados so black that even guacamole couldn\u2019t save them. And the only backups I can think of are greasy takeout or a slice of pizza from the shop next door, both bound to leave me with a salt hangover the next day.Kale + Coriander Flatbread\nThanks to Daily Harvest\u2019s flatbreads, nights like these are rare now. I keep my freezer stocked with options so that I know I can always get my servings of vegetables in. Their flatbreads go from freezer-to-plate in minutes but hear me out: these aren\u2019t your mom\u2019s frozen meals. First of all, they\u2019re completely plant-based and 95% organic. The all-veggie crusts on the flatbreads are made with cauliflower, broccoli, or sweet potato\u2014and without any of the cornstarch, corn flour, xanthan gum or other processed ingredients that some gluten-free crusts use. They\u2019re topped with delicious sauces like creamy cauliflower and tahini as well as more vegetables, and they\u2019re all gluten and dairy free. I love the Kale + Coriander Flatbread, which has a sweet potato crust and a cilantro and parsnip-based green sauce and is topped with red cabbage (Vitamin K!), kale (fiber!), and hemp hearts (omega-3s!). Spicy, hearty, pizza-y, and happens to be great for me.Artichoke + Spinach Flatbread\nEating these flatbreads\u2014along with Harvest Bowls like Spinach + Shiitake Grits and Sweet Potato + Wild Rice Hash\u2014has made me think about frozen food in a new way. The produce in these dishes is actually fresher than what I can find in the grocery store\u2019s produce aisles much of the time. Grocery supply chains harvest produce when it\u2019s still green (before it reaches peak-nutrition) and it degrades in nutritional value over the weeks and months before it appears on the shelf. It also often requires chemicals and preservation methods to help keep it \u201cfresh.\u201d On the other hand, all the fruits and vegetables in Daily Harvest\u2019s dishes are harvested at the perfect moment\u2014when their nutritional (and flavor) potential is highest. Then the produce is frozen, on the farms, within 24 hours, which locks in these nutrients and flavor eliminates the need for preservatives. (No ultra-refined, hyper-processed, oversalted, and additive-laden products here). That means food that tastes incredibly fresh straight from the freezer to the pan to my mouth.Artichoke + Spinach Flatbread\nFreezing also helps reduce food waste, producing 47-percent less waste compared to non-frozen foods. That means, even if the grocery store is full of wilting kale, it won\u2019t end up sitting in my fridge. And I\u2019ll be supporting sustainability-minded farmers, and my tastebuds, instead.
