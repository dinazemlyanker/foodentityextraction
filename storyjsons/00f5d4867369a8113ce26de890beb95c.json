We asked 80 of the most interesting people we know to reveal the local spots they love the most.I wish I could tell you that my go-to Honolulu restaurant is Ono Seafood for the poke over hot rice; or Helena\u2019s for the kalua pork straight from an imu (underground oven); or perhaps even Palace Saimin for the namesake noodle soup hybrid of wonton mein, pancit, and ramen.But after a ten-hour flight from New York City to Honolulu, the first stop I make is the Zippy\u2019s two miles from my grandma\u2019s house in Kuli\u2019ou\u2019ou Valley in the the Koko Marina mall. For 52 years, Hawaii\u2019s iconic diner-esque chain has been supplying locals with over 100 tons of meaty chili a month across its 24 locations scattered throughout the islands and soon Vegas.Yes, it's in a mall.\nCOURTESY OF ZIPPY'SSure, there\u2019s no poi on the menu. There\u2019s no poke. But there is Spam. There\u2019s mac salad, the mayo-meets-elbow-macaroni side dish that\u2019s become a staple on any menu in Hawaii. There\u2019s a patty melt and a Kraft Singles\u2013topped thin-patty cheeseburger. There\u2019s saimin. Then, of course, there\u2019s the chili, which is a totally normal thing to pile on spaghetti (or a bowl of rice) in Hawaii. This is what has shaken out in the short but storied history of the state. Without launching into a full-on history lesson, many forces have shaped Hawaii\u2019s cuisine and this literal fusion of dishes remains. (We can thank the U.S. military presence for the Spam.) And the locals really like it.My sister adds chubby little wontons to the saimin. My mom pours at least three small bowls of nose-clearing, locally produced Tropics Chinese hot mustard into hers. My brother loves the fried chicken, and my dad orders the Zip Pac (c, not k, he corrected me over a family text). In it, there\u2019s Spam, fried and crackled around the edges from cooking in its own fat; craggy fried chicken; beef teriyaki; breaded and fried hoki (blue hake); and white rice speckled with furikake. It\u2019s the thing he ate as a teenager growing up in Hawaii, and it instantly transforms him from lawyer dad to local boy in a matter of hours anytime he flies in from LAX. A little bit of pidgin slips into his speech. The Hawaiian shirt comes out. We kids always made fun of him for this\u2014betting on how quickly we\u2019d start hearing \u201cya\u201d tacked on to the end of his sentences\u2014but now I get it.The saimin, my sister's favorite.\nCourtesy of Zippy'sStepping into Zippy\u2019s is like being home, if home had sea-foam-green leather booths. You\u2019ll find summer soccer camps breaking for the evening, older couples making their routine dinner stop, and families just like our own. There was nothing like Zippy\u2019s in Valencia, California, the small suburb north of Los Angeles where I grew up and where my parents still live. So we had to cobble together our own sort of Hawaii, an homage of sorts to my dad\u2019s childhood. During each visit, my parents stocked up on frozen Portuguese sausage at the Costco close to my grandma\u2019s house and smuggled it back in suitcases. They found the only shave ice place in Valencia, and we basically kept it in business for a few years. At our favorite all-you-can-eat sushi restaurant in Valencia, Light & Healthy, my dad settled for a very abbreviated Zip Pac with beef teriyaki, mac salad, and rice.My dad's beloved Zip Pac.\nCourtesy of Zippy'sWe still trek to Hawaii nearly every year despite living all over the country. And Zippy\u2019s welcomes us back each time with with its mash-up of diner staples, a menu of immigrant dishes that bumped up against each other and birthed a cuisine wholly unique to Hawaii. There\u2019s something comforting that 22 of the 24 Zippy\u2019s live on Oahu alone. We can be anywhere on the island\u2014making the rounds to extended family, hanging out at Kailua Beach\u2014and know that Spam, fried chicken, and chili-slicked spaghetti is always within reach.Elyse Inamine is the digital restaurant editor of Bon App\u00e9tit.ContentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Explore Bon App\u00e9titNeighborhood RestaurantsRead Morecity-guidesWhere to Find the Best Poke in OahuBy Ashley MasoncultureHow a Surf Goddess Eats to WinBy Alejandra BorundarestaurantsAndrew McCarthy Seeks Banana Bread in Maui, HawaiiBy Bon App\u00e9titRecipes you want to make.
