As long as the brew is good, I\u2019ll take it in a tall boy or a frosty bottle or one of those tiny ca\u00f1as that you get at bars in Spain. But if we\u2019re talking about the best beer glasses for your home bar, the ones that will really let your craft beer be all it can be, there is a clear winner\u2014Rastal\u2019s Teku glasses.Teku Beer Glasses (6 Pack)$60 at AmazonWhat makes the Teku the best glass for beer?The Teku glass was designed by Italian craft beer experts Teo Musso and Lorenzo \u201cKuaska\u201d Dabove and is manufactured by the German glassware company Rastal. Here in America, we historically haven\u2019t given much thought to our beer glassware. Shaker pints\u2014which, from a form perspective, are essentially Solo cups, but made of glass\u2014are ubiquitous in bars not because they\u2019ve been designed to highlight the nuanced bouquet of an imperial stout. Rather, they\u2019re hard to break, easy to clean, and can be stacked 20 high by a barback making the rounds after last call. Teo and Kuaska (TeKu, get it?) thought craft beers deserved better.In a world of softly rounded tulip glasses and tall, willowy Hefeweizen glasses, the Teku is stemmed and angular, like a wine glass crossed with a witch\u2019s cauldron. A good beer glass should trap the aroma of the beer so that when you go in for a sip, you\u2019re smelling as well as tasting. To do this, the glass needs a body with a top that\u2019s smaller than the base, so the aroma doesn\u2019t leave your glass all at once. (This same logic applies to wine glasses.) You want your IPA\u2019s notes of tropical fruit and pine needles and dank marijuana to sit at the top of the glass, not dissipate into the ether within seconds of being poured.That\u2019s fruity beer! Not wine!\nPhoto by Alex LauThen there\u2019s the stem\u2014same idea here as with a wine glass. I\u2019m a slow drinker, and I\u2019d like a perfectly chilled Gose to stay that way until my glass is empty. One thing that doesn\u2019t work in my favor? Perpetually sweaty palms. But with the Teku, I don\u2019t have to worry about bringing my beer up to body temp because I\u2019m only touching the stem.Finally, there\u2019s that little lip, curving outward from the top of the glass. This is a thoughtful if not totally necessary flourish, but the slim rim of the glass nestles pleasingly along your lip when you sip\u2014a contrast to a chunky pint glass.Do I even need a glass?If you\u2019re headed to the beach or going camping or popping a Miller High Life at a backyard barbecue, no, you don\u2019t need to bring along your fancy stemmed glassware. But pouring your beer into a glass does objectively allow you to better appreciate it. (The 14-ounce Teku is perfectly equipped to hold the contents of a 12-ounce can or bottle of beer.) You won\u2019t be able to admire the tangerine hue of a hazy IPA through aluminum, and good luck trying to huff its juicy aroma through the mouth of the can. Drinking a great craft beer from a can is like when you hear the song of the summer blasting so loudly from a car across the street that you can hum along even though its windows are up. It\u2019s still a banger, but wouldn\u2019t you rather be in that car? (Don\u2019t drink and drive.)Should you build your own Teku pyramid at home? Eh, probably not.\nPhoto by Alex LauIs the Teku glass the best glass for all beers?The beauty of the Teku beer glass is that it\u2019s a true all-rounder, as good with a saison as it is with a hoppy ale. If you\u2019re going to have one set of house beer glasses, go with the Teku. But if you\u2019re more of the \u201cvariety is the spice of life\u201d type, consider picking up this craft beer tasting kit from Spiegelau, another German glass manufacturer. They\u2019re particularly well known for their IPA glass, beloved by many hopheads, and you\u2019ll get one of those in this kit in addition to glasses for wheat beers, stouts, and barrel-aged beers. If you\u2019re into the Teku but you\u2019re an even slower drinker than I am, opt for the slightly smaller, 11.2-ounce Mini Teku.Spiegelau Craft Beer Tasting Glasses Kit$46 $40 at AmazonMini Teku Beer Glasses (2 Pack)$33 at AmazonHaven\u2019t I seen these before?The Teku glass is so beloved that independent breweries often make branded versions as merch. Collect them like Pok\u00e9mon from Copenhagen\u2019s Mikkeller, Brooklyn\u2019s Other Half, and Alaska\u2019s 49th State Brewing. Or go the custom route and have a set engraved with your favorite inspirational quote.How much are these going to set me back?You might assume that a specialty craft beer glass imported from Europe would be obnoxiously pricey, but a set of six Tekus clocks in at $58\u2014under ten bucks a piece. If you\u2019re serious about your craft brews, that\u2019s a reasonable price to pay for the best beer glass out there.Wait, what\u2019s an IPA?10 Styles of IPA to Know Before Your Next Round of BeersOnce you know the difference in IPAs, you can find your IPA soulmate.View StoryEditor\u2019s note: This article was originally published July 12, 2018.Explore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingToolsRecipes you want to make.
