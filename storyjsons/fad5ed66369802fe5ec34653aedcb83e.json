And yet, that\u2019s never stopped me from baking a brand new (at least to me) dessert from Bon App\u00e9tit each Thanksgiving, much to my family\u2019s chagrin. There was the year I over-pulsed the hazelnuts for this Pumpkin-Caramel Tart and spent half an hour carefully blotting away the nut grease that kept seeping out of my oily baked crust. Then there was the time I opted for this Cranberry-Lime Pie, which looked GREAT until I tried to slice it. Can you even cut something the consistency of pudding? But on my quest for redemption in 2018, I picked this new Glazed and Flaky Apple Tart and then proceeded to break my own rule by testing it out first.This is the part where I\u2019m supposed to convince you that you NEED to make this apple tart, and honestly I\u2019m not even sure where to begin. So I\u2019ll say this: It\u2019s likely one of the only times you\u2019ll feel extreme satisfaction while watching something you\u2019ve spent hours making completely crumble apart.Apples, face down in a complex maple syrup\u2013brandy\u2013vanilla situation.\nMichael GraydonIf that\u2019s not convincing, there\u2019s this: The apples are halved and cored (no chopping! No slicing!), then roasted in a maple syrup-brandy-vanilla mixture that infuses the fruit with lots of complex, toasty flavor. These tender apples then get laid atop a delightfully crunchy bed of stir-together almond streusel. But the real pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance is that you make your own freakin\u2019 amazing PUFF PASTRY, like some kind of dough god.True puff pastry is made via a technique called lamination, in which pastry dough is repeatedly layered with butter then folded and rolled again and again until you end up with endless layers that tower and puff up as they bake\u2014this is what gives croissants, palmiers, and turnovers their irresistibly buttery-crisp texture. This recipe\u2019s streamlined method requires far fewer fold-and-rolls, but achieves a similarly impressive effect. I have no better baking skills than your hobbyist cake baker, but I came out of this tart-making experience feeling like I could school Pierre Herm\u00e9 in a croissant-off, which is how I imagine this tart\u2019s genius mastermind, Claire Saffitz, feels every day. Here\u2019s the thing I never realized until I made this recipe: If you can make pie crust, you can make puff pastry.To create layers and layers of flaky pastry, fold the dough into thirds like a letter then roll out into a smooth sheet with a rolling pin.\nPhoto by Michael Graydon + Nikole Herriott, food styling by Rebecca Jurkevich, prop styling by Kalen KaminskiI learned a few more tricks from Claire that made my finished tart look like it belonged behind the display case at a high-end bakery. 1) She suggests using a melon baller for the most neatly cored apple halves, but I haven\u2019t seen a melon baller since 2002 and have found that a round teaspoon also works perfectly. w) Use a ruler when slicing off thin dough strips from the sides of your tart dough to create the neatest border. 3) And don\u2019t worry about arranging your roasted apple halves in a perfect 3x4 grid within your tart\u2014in fact, the more askew and random they are, the prettier and more natural the final effect. As my test-run tart baked in the Test Kitchen oven at 6:30 p.m. a few weeks ago, scenting the entire room with maple and vanilla as it cooked, I kept cracking open the oven door and screaming at Claire over my shoulder, \"It\u2019s WORKING!!!\"A crunchy bed of streusel before it\u2019s topped with baked apples.\nMichael GraydonThere are few things I\u2019ll do differently when I make this for Thanksgiving. One of them is to use medium apples as, uh, the recipes calls for, and not the cute, slightly-too-tiny apples I acquired during an apple-picking sojourn. I\u2019ll also break up the project over the course of a couple of days. Making it all in a single day is an excellent way to procrastinate for 6 hours at work, but it wasn\u2019t  the most effective way of going about the recipe. Next time, I\u2019ll make the dough and roast the apples a day ahead (though you can make them up to two days ahead) and assemble and bake on Thanksgiving day. I\u2019ll then cut it into slabs and serve it with scoops of vanilla ice cream. I\u2019ll probably eat seconds standing up in the kitchen watching my dad do the dishes and start his turkey-corn chowder with all the leftover meat. And if I\u2019m lucky enough to wake up to thirds for breakfast, well, there\u2019s a high chance that last night\u2019s pint of ice cream will be joining me at the table.Get the Recipe:Glazed and Flaky Apple TartIf you're the type who prefers fruit desserts that go heavy on the fruit, this flaky, crunchy, juicy apple tart's for you.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titThanksgivingAppleDessertRead MorecookingThe Easy Thanksgiving Dessert For \"People Who Don't Bake\"By Amiel StanekcookingThis Shaved Carrot and Charred Date Salad Will Make You Ditch Lettuce for GoodBy Aliza AbarbanelcookingThe Glazed Brussels Sprouts You\u2019ll Be Making All FallBy Alex BeggsRecipes you want to make.
