This is where you go on your birthday, anniversary, or the day you get a raise. It\u2019s a special occasion spot, but for all other occasions, hit the bar.ORDER THE: the tasting menu for $255, please. At the bar, however, you can order \u00e0 la carte. Musts: the fried chicken, fried four times and served cold (go with it); the tangy-nutty sourdough crepes (eat with your hands); foie gras pork pie (you\u2019re here, aren\u2019t you?); and the crudo in a bowl-licking sauce. However, the menu changes daily, written in near-illegible notebooks, so best to ask for the verbal version. Don\u2019t sleep on the wines by the glass, an offering of out-there, rare bottles you\u2019d have trouble tracking down elsewhere. We almost forgot the most important dish (!!!): Japanese cheesecake, a brick-shaped sponge-cloud of heaven.WORD TO THE WISE: Ask a lot of questions! These chefs are at the top of their game, and they have a good sense of humor\u2014they\u2019re also right there in front of your seat, so it\u2019s sort of awkward (and rude) to ignore them. If you have no idea what\u2019s on the plate in front of you, get all of the details. It\u2019ll enrich your experience and reveal the near-absurd methods to the madness behind the menu.THE VIBE IS: a dark and moody lair with smooth wood surfaces, like an interior treehouse decorated minimally, save for a fantasy-novel-spray-painted mural and a windowed wall that displays the meat freezer (aging meat counts as art here). Attention to detail of the utmost level, from every handmade ceramic tea cup to delicate glassware that feels like holding a hologram.TO DRINK OR NOT TO DRINK: That\u2019s the question that\u2019s entirely up to you. The alcohol pairings will knock your clogs off. Or you could stick with the incredible tea selection, or explore the ingenious (limited availability!) non-alcoholic pairing, which is unlike any other in town. Instead of clever juice mocktails, they put time\u2014and fermentation\u2014into it, serving complex, flavorful NA drinks that mimic the depth of wine and spirits. Mind-blowing, tbh, especially the hibiscus brew that winks at pinot noir.PRACTICAL STUFF: Open Tuesday through Thursday, from 3 to 11:30 p.m; Friday and Saturday, from 12:30 to 11:30 p.m.; and Sunday, from 12:30 to 3:30 p.m. Closed Monday. Reserve via OpenTable, but, you can\u2019t order the tasting menu at the bar, so don\u2019t even try. The bar is walk-in only and serves as the entrance to the dining room, so it fills up with tasting menu guests at around 7:45 p.m. The good news, though, it\u2019s an unexpected after-work spot where you can easily grab a seat at 6:30 or 7 p.m.\u2014Alex BeggsWE ALSO LOVEAskaThe new New Nordic tasting-menu blowout.Le CoucouA fine French meal that turns any night into a special occasionMission Chinese FoodIt's back.
