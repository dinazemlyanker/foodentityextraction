When something\u2019s so easy to make that you don\u2019t even need one. Welcome to It\u2019s That Simple, a column where we talk you through the process of making the dishes and drinks we can make with our eyes closed.I associate summer with the abundance of squash: Zucchini, calabazita, and yellow squashes are at every farmers market, in every CSA box, and overflowing from crates at fruit stands all over New York City. But more specifically, I associate summer with the taste of kabachkovaya ikra, Russian squash caviar, a silky and flavorful dip made from summer squash that have been cooked down with tomatoes, carrots, and other veggies until they reach a state of jammy perfection. The caviar is often canned or frozen during the summer and fall to enjoy during the long winters\u2014a taste of sunshine when our daylight hours are shortened to a skimp five.The simplest way to enjoy it is slathered on a slab of toasted and buttered borodinsky khleb (a dark rye sourdough bread)\u2014a breakfast or after-school snack I often shared with my mother in our tiny kitchen in Moscow. While she opted for the store-bought canned product, popularized during the Soviet Union, I grew to love making my own, often inspired by my aunt\u2019s lush garden on the outskirts of Moscow and those at my high school friends\u2019 dachas, where their babushkas tended their vegetable rows and processed their own compost.It\u2019s the perfect way to use up squash and can be endlessly modified to your taste. More modern recipes now have added roasted red peppers (which I really enjoy), apples, and even mayonnaise. This recipe is as versatile and flexible as you want it to be\u2014and is always a crowd-pleaser. (Bonus: It\u2019s vegan and gluten-free!) Here's how to make it:Peel and thinly slice 1 large yellow onion and heat 3 Tbsp. neutral oil in a heavy pan with a lid or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the onion to the oil and cook until starting to brown and caramelize, about 15\u201320 minutes. While the onions are cooking, char 1 red bell pepper directly on a gas burner or under the broiler until blackened on all sides, then set aside to cool in a resealable plastic bag. (This step will ensure easy peeling. Peeling all the vegetables is key to a smooth dip!)While the pepper cools, peel and finely chop 3 large garlic cloves and 2 small carrots. Add to the onions and cook until soft. Peel and chop 1 medium tomato and 2 medium zucchini and add both to the pan. Peel, seed, and chop the cooled-off pepper and add to the pan.Stir in 2 Tbsp. tomato paste and season the vegetables with salt, freshly ground black pepper, and some fresh chopped dill. Then lower the heat and cook it all down until the vegetables are soft and jammy. Let the mixture cool slightly, then pur\u00e9e until smooth using an immersion blender or high-speed blender. (Don\u2019t add water; the vegetables\u2019 water content should be sufficient.) Adjust salt, pepper, and dill to taste. The squash caviar can then be stored in the fridge for up to seven days, but also freezes extremely well, a great option when you have a ton of squash to use up.My favorite thing to do with the caviar while it\u2019s still hot is to toss it with just-cooked pasta\u2014it makes for the perfect summer sauce, light but boldly flavored. After a night in the fridge, it makes an excellent dip for all manner of crudit\u00e9s, crackers, and breads. In Russia, it\u2019s also commonly layered with fried or boiled potatoes, added to an omelet, or simply dolloped atop rice for a boost of flavor and nutrients. Many of us who grew up in Russia were fed squash caviar in school canteens, a vitamin-packed dish beloved by even the most finicky eaters.Every summer I yearn for the nostalgic taste of this dish, one that every Russian knows like the back of their hand. I hope someday to pick my own squash on the soil of my motherland again, but for now, I share my childhood memories with my partner in our Queens apartment, eating homemade kabachkovaya ikra by the spoonful.Explore Bon App\u00e9titIt's That SimplecookingRecipes you want to make.
