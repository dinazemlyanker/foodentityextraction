Plus, an impressive-yet-unintimidating wine menu that breaks down wines into simple descriptors like \"bigger, bolder reds\" and \"full and round whites.\u201dORDER THE: trio of pastas, served family style, for a \u201csurprise me\u201d situation. There are new hand-rolled specials daily, but mainstays are the carbonara-style spaghetti chitarra; translucent, tender pappardelle with a simple butter and Parm sauce\u2014and optional shaved truffles in season\u2014and inventively-filled tortellini. Also look out for \"not pasta\" options like 72-hour braised short ribs over polenta with tender, sweet onions agrodolce or whole fish. There are also gluten-free options for those friends who usually can\u2019t do Italian with you.FOR A LITTLE MORE BALANCE: At lunch, \u201cMaria\u2019s Menu\u201d offers a two-course healthyish Mediterranean menu (from grilled cod and chickpeas to summer gazpacho), giving you a nice excuse to end the meal with house-made soft-serve gelato.THE VIBE IS: bright and spacious by day, cozy and homey by night. As casual or as formal as you\u2019d like\u2014you could just as easily come from work or take a date here. Sit at the bar and watch pasta fed through the extruder into dozens of shapes, or lean into comfortable pillows at a wooden booth in the back. In the warmer months, pick a table in the covered veranda or outdoors on the patio. It\u2019d be excellent for a birthday party.PRACTICAL STUFF: Reservations available via Reserve or by phone at at 202-350-1312.
