I don\u2019t hear another word the guide says. I\u2019m too mesmerized by hope, the idea that the various messes in which we find ourselves are not the endgame. For an afternoon, a week, a month, I\u2019m an island of optimism. Of course, it doesn\u2019t last. Bad news pierces the bubble. The most recent decade saw more greenhouse gas emissions than the one before; the curve is going in the wrong direction. But I return again and again to this notion: There are solutions that will save everybody.James Rogers, founder of the produce preservation company Apeel, must believe it too. He didn\u2019t have a makers\u2019 lab when he was in school, but weekend trips to the local hardware store were enough to fire his imagination. At first, his visions centered on the democratization of clean energy, but then one day, driving past some particularly lush farmland, he thought about the magnitude of food waste and how hard it is for \u201cgrowers to optimize their harvest practices, so that produce can stay on the vine longer in order to reach full nutritional and flavor potential,\u201d as he puts it now.It was then that he had his lightbulb moment: Nature had it right, it was just a bit parsimonious. The idea is one you\u2019ll be familiar with if you\u2019ve peeled citrus, sliced open a perfectly green avocado, or shaved the tough part off a stalk of asparagus. If so, you\u2019ve observed how skins naturally preserve fruits and vegetables. The problem is that for most produce, the protective layer doesn\u2019t last long enough for the way we live now. Take English cucumbers, for example. You buy a couple on your weekly trip to the grocery store and if you don\u2019t use them by the end of the week, they\u2019re so mushy you have to toss them.Rogers didn\u2019t come at this problem from the perspective of a frustrated home cook but rather as a scientist. \u201cWhat causes produce to go bad? Water going out and oxygen going in,\u201d he explains. Thinking back to his undergraduate days at Carnegie Mellon University, where he learned about how steel reacts to oxygen in the air and rusts, he recalled how elements like chromium or nickel can form an oxide barrier that physically protects the steel from further oxidation. \u201cI thought if food goes bad in the same way, could we put a little barrier around it that would slow down perishability? And could that help put a dent in the hunger problem?\u201dWhat if we could make this barrier out of food? Then we\u2019d be using food to preserve food, and that would be something worth building.Of course, nobody wants chemicals on their food, but at the same time, Rogers says, \u201cwater is a chemical. Food is a chemical. Wait a minute\u2014everything we eat is a chemical! So what if we could make this barrier out of food? Then we\u2019d be using food to preserve food, and that would be something worth building.\u201dApeel\u2019s technology uses plant-derived materials to make a tasteless, odorless, invisible \u201cpeel\u201d that is then applied directly to produce including limes, avocados, mandarin oranges, and apples. This extra skin keeps moisture in and oxygen out, delaying the time it takes for the produce to go bad. The proof is undeniable: An apple treated with Apeel will stay fresh two to three times longer than one that hasn\u2019t been treated. It also works on cucumbers, a win not only for retailers and chefs, but for anyone looking to decrease plastic usage. According to Rogers, treating English cucumbers with Apeel\u2019s technology rather than plastic wrap saves the equivalent of 85 million straws.All of this is a boon for consumers and for grocery stores, which have to throw away 43 billion pounds of food each year. According to its own internal research, Apeel has saved over 5 million avocados at grocery stores from going to waste since 2018, which in turn has saved enough water to fill 427 Olympic-size swimming pools.As for consumers, Apeel offers a minimal-effort way to reduce food waste\u2014and financial waste too. Imagine one of those nights when you\u2019re all set to go home and make dinner with the fresh produce that\u2019s been languishing in your crisper drawer (I highly recommend Fat Choy\u2019s Smashed Cucumber Salad). But then a friend spontaneously snags a reservation at an in-demand restaurant. If you\u2019ve got Apeel veggies in your fridge, you can go out to dinner without worrying about them going bad.Of course, Apeel isn\u2019t operating in a vacuum. There are other forward-looking companies addressing the staggering amount of food wasted in the U.S., which is estimated to be as high as 40 percent of the food supply. Biodegradable coffee pods, reusable silicone storage bags, sustainable alternatives to deforestation-causing palm oil. Other tinkerers, other visionaries. One might not yet be 14, on her own tour of a makers lab, her imagination ready to be set afire. Ready to come up with new solutions that just might save everybody.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishTechnologyRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
