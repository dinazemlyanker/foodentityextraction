Usually these tools are utensils: Microplanes, fish spatulas, offset spatulas, chef\u2019s knives. Sometimes they are certain pans or storage containers or gadgets. For me, it\u2019s the toaster oven, which is my most-used kitchen appliance.The one I own\u2014the one every single person in my family owns, actually, as though getting one is a level that must be unlocked in the simulation of our lives\u2014is the Panasonic FlashXpress Toaster Oven. Unlike my Instant Pot, KitchenAid mixer, and Vitamix blender, it resides in a place of honor on my countertop, out in the open for everyone to see. Partially this is because of its modest footprint\u2014only 12x13\". Mostly it\u2019s because it is the best thing in my kitchen.Photo by Isa ZapataPanasonic FlashXpress Toaster Oven$170 at Amazon$160 at Michael'sWhy is the Panasonic FlashXpress the best toaster oven?With a compact design\u2014although it can still fit up to four slices of bread\u2014and a $150 price tag, this stainless-steel toaster oven is versatile but less expensive than a big, fancy, bells-and-whistles toaster oven (more on that later). It has one infrared heating element toward the front and another in the back for speedy, even cooking and maximum efficiency with no preheating required. In addition to its temperature controls, which go up to 500 degrees, it has six preset cooking functions for toast, frozen waffles, rolls, pizza, hash browns and french fries, and reheating leftovers. It also has a removable crumb tray, an interior oven light, and \u201cshade control\u201d functionality so you can tailor your toast to the perfect level of doneness. I appreciate the retractable baking rack; every time I open the door, it\u2019s as if the Panasonic FlashXpress is presenting me with a tiny gift of a gently warmed brownie or perfectly toasted cashews.Besides four slices of toast, what can I cook in my toaster oven?This toaster oven does so much. It toasts bread, as you\u2019d expect. It bakes cookies and brownies and summer-fruit cakes without raising the temperature in my apartment the way the full-size oven would. It roasts veggies of all kinds, from Sungolds that burst into saucy perfection to heartier items like root vegetables and brussels sprouts. (My favorite Thanksgiving tip: Roast your brussels sprouts in the toaster oven to save on valuable oven real estate.) It turns tofu crisp and bakes marinated paneer; it cooks salmon and chicken breasts and basically anything you can fit into an 8x8\" square pan. It toasts nuts; it reheats meals if you, like me, don\u2019t have a microwave; it handles frozen pizza and waffles marvelously. I love it so much that I feel bad for calling the other oven in my home the \u201creal\u201d oven\u2014I definitely use this one much, much more.The Panasonic FlashXpress is the best small toaster oven out there, and I recommend it to everyone and anyone. But I accept that perhaps your needs are different from my own. I got you.If your oven is busted and you really need to roast a chicken:If counter space and money are no object, seek out the Breville Smart Oven Pro. When professional baker Yossy Arefi\u2019s regular oven broke, she tested all the recipes for her cookbook Snacking Cakes using this very oven! The Smart Oven Pro holds its temperature consistently and, at 15.75x18.5\", it can accommodate a quarter-sheet pan or a 9x13\" baking dish. It toasts, roasts, bakes, slow-cooks, and broils\u2014you can even fit a whole chicken in there.Breville Smart Oven Pro$525 $280 at Sur La Table$280 at Bloomingdales'sIf you have a small kitchen. Like, a really small kitchen:You, friend, should consider the Dash mini toaster oven. It\u2019s adorably petite at only 9x9\"\u2014perfect for a dorm room\u2014and comes in a variety of pastel colors like butter yellow and peony pink. Former art assistant Annalee Soskin kept one of these at her desk for her toasting her morning bagel or heating up those midafternoon pizza bites. This is not going to be your kitchen workhorse by any means, but this compact toaster oven is cute, it\u2019s tiny, and it works.Dash Mini Toaster Oven$25 at Amazon$25 at TargetIf you desire a toaster oven that\u2019s also an air fryer:Air fryers use a little convection fan to circulate hot air and achieve max crispiness. Some toaster ovens come with a convection setting, so if you\u2019re in the market for a combo appliance, we recommend the Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer Pro. If you have a lot of counter space (this thing is big at 21.25x17\") and want a toaster oven that can both roast a 14-lb. turkey and dehydrate mushrooms, you\u2019ll love the Breville\u2019s large capacity. The Smart Oven Air Fryer toaster oven is equipped with a digital display and six heating elements that automatically adjust according to your setting selection. When you want to air-fry some sesame-coconut chicken tenders, set it to \u201cSuper Convection\u201d and your food will emerge extra-crispy (the setting also reduces cooking time by 30%). This convection toaster oven also comes with two heavy-duty oven racks, an enamel baking pan, a nonstick pizza pan, and a mesh basket for air-frying.Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer Pro$750 $400 at Sur La TableIf you need a designer toaster oven for your designer kitchenThere\u2019s only one countertop toaster oven sold by the MoMA Design Store, and it\u2019s Balmuda\u2019s The Toaster. This Japanese stunner comes in colors like matte black and an incredibly sophisticated shade of greige. Compared to all the buttons and displays on Breville toaster ovens, it\u2019s minimalist in design with just two knobs\u2014one for cook modes and one for cook time. It also comes with a delightful mini coffee cup that holds exactly a teaspoon of liquid. Fill the mug\u2014which looks like it\u2019s sized for a mouse\u2014with water and pour it into the oven\u2019s reservoir before turning it on; the Balmuda will then release steam into the interior (you\u2019ll hear a pleasant hiss and see the glass fog up), which allegedly toasts bread more quickly while sealing in moisture and flavor. While we can\u2019t say we can taste the difference between steam-toasted bread and traditionally toasted bread, Balmuda\u2019s The Toaster works like a charm, has a small footprint (12.6x14.1\"), and is so beautifully designed that it\u2019s practically an objet.Balmuda The Toaster$299 at Amazon$330 at Sur La TableTiffany Hopkins contributed additional reporting to this piece.Explore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingToolsRecipes you want to make.
