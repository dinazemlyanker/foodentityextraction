(Yeah, you heard us right.)By Alex DelanyJune 14, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailFacebookTwitterEmailSome would call us big whipped cream people over here at Basically. Others would say we're whipped cream fanatics. Some might even go so far as to claim that we include whipped cream whenever and wherever possible. So yeah, we'll admit it: We love whipped cream. But just because you love something doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t make it better (just don't try to do that with your significant other).Sometimes creamy, lightly sweetened, and pillowy just isn\u2019t enough. Sometime you need to introduce one more flavor to the spectrum: Tang.And where does that come from? Sour cream. Thick and tart, it's our secret weapon when it comes to turning whipped cream up to 11, lending a brightness that makes buttery, sweet desserts taste more refreshing. (Sour cream is also what helps to make the biscuits in our Strawberry Shortcakes so light and tender.)Here\u2019s how to upgrade your whipped cream:\nWhisk your heavy cream in a large bowl using a whisk (if you're strong) or a hand mixer (if you're efficient) until soft peaks start to form. (If you're using an electric beater, gradually increase the speed as the whipped cream thickens to avoid messy splattering.) Once you start to see soft peaks (the shapes that cling to the edge of your whisk and stand up in the bowl but slump over in cloud-like billows), add \u00bc sour cream for every 1\u00bd cups of heavy cream. Whisk in the sour cream in until it\u2019s incorporated fully, but don\u2019t go any further!
