When something\u2019s so easy to make that you don\u2019t even need one. Welcome to It\u2019s That Simple, a column where we talk you through the process of making the dishes and drinks we can make with our eyes closed.One December day in 2015, my friend Folakunle Oshun, a Nigerian-born sculptor, organized an Around West Africa in Jollof cook-off as part of his exhibition and installation called \u201cWolof/Jollof.\u201d Each volunteer, of which I was one, got assigned a version of jollof rice, the spiced red rice beloved in every country south of the Sahara. I drew Senegal, and so began my journey.The base of thi\u00e9boudienne, Senegal\u2019s national rice dish and, some say, the mother of all jollof, is fish and seafood that\u2019s slashed and stuffed with a thick, spiced herby paste-slash-sauce called rof. The thi\u00e9b was so good, it changed my mind about parsley, for good and forever. Before rof, Greek salad was the only dish where I allowed parsley to feature\u2014where sweet and tart tomatoes meet intense Kalamata olives, crisp lettuce, and crunchy cucumbers, a sprinkling of fresh parsley works well. Otherwise, though, I\u2019d look over this herb in favor of others.In the city of Thi\u00e8s in western Senegal, there is an area called rof, but I\u2019m not a hundred percent sure if this is where this sauce gets its name. While my research continues, this bright green sauce made me fall in love with Senegal and parsley all at the same time\u2014and it might have you doing the same.How to make Senegalese rof:Traditionally, parsley, onions, scallions, a mix of hot chiles (which we call peppers in West Africa), and stock cubes are pounded in a mortar and pestle to create a bright assertive paste. Unfortunately, short of making a chopping board version, my blender is the only piece of processing equipment in my rental apartment.To make it, add \u00bd small red or white onion, chopped, the whites of 2 scallions, chopped, 1 bunch parsley, roughly chopped (about 2 cups), 2 cloves garlic (or more, to taste), 1\u20132 small green chiles (like Thai chiles), \u00bd tsp. freshly ground black pepper, \u00bd tsp. crushed red pepper flakes, and \u00bc tsp. salt to a food processor or blender. (If you\u2019re worried about the heat levels, hold off the green chiles until the end and add them gradually to taste.) Pulse until coarse or pound in a mortar with a pestle.If you\u2019re using a blender, as I do, you may have to add a touch of water or oil to get the ingredients to meld. But if you\u2019re using a food processor, you might not need any additional liquid. The result is a multi-textured paste that resembles finely chopped greens and onions with specks of red from the red pepper flakes. It\u2019s a bright assertive mixture that reminds me of pesto, without any graininess from nuts and hard cheese.Rof\u2019s flexibility is another thing I love. I like to use it in its original applications\u2014to stuff fish and to season seafood\u2014but also as a dip, especially for tostones. I\u2019ll also thin it with oil and citrus juice to dress my salads (tomatoes are a favorite), stir it into yogurt, or fold it into hot pasta.And while my version may not be certifiably classic, it approximates the deliciousness of the first time I tried it and provides a very good reason to purchase a bunch or two of parsley.Ozoz Sokoh, The Kitchen Butterfly, is a Nigerian-born exploration geologist turned food-obsessive who uses foodways to explore personal narratives of history and heritage, culture, identity, and belonging.Explore Bon App\u00e9titParsleyherbSauceAfricanIt's That SimpleRecipes you want to make.
