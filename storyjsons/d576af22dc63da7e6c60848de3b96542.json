And she\u2019s done keeping quiet about it.By Deborah VanTrece, as told to Hilary CadiganSeptember 24, 2020FacebookTwitterEmailIllustration by Alexis EkeFacebookTwitterEmailI was in my early 20s the day I went shopping at a store in Independence, Missouri. It was a day like any other; I don\u2019t even remember what store it was. What I do remember is being accused of stealing something. Within minutes a policeman was approaching me. I told him I hadn\u2019t done anything. He hit me over the head with a billy club and knocked me unconscious.I remember coming to as he was dragging me across the ground and throwing me into the back of his police car. I remember the long drive to the station. I remember that when we got there, they went through my bag and saw right away that I hadn\u2019t stolen anything. That I was a college student. That I\u2019d never been in trouble. \u201cOkay,\u201d they said. \u201cYou can go.\u201dBack then I wasn\u2019t a chef yet. I didn\u2019t have any awards under my belt or recognition to my name. I didn\u2019t know what the decades ahead would look like, what I\u2019d go through to get where I am today\u2014owner of an award-winning Atlanta soul food restaurant. Back then I was young and I was Black. That was it. I was young and I was Black and I was shopping someplace somebody thought I shouldn\u2019t have been.Every Black person has stories like this. We have some that are collectively the same and some that are our own as individuals. But something\u2019s happened to all of us\u2014and that\u2019s why we have to speak out.Growing up in Kansas City, I was the kid who didn\u2019t order kid\u2019s meals. I ordered full-on entr\u00e9es. I fell in love with cooking in seventh-grade home economics. Those fluffy French omelets got me. Beating the egg whites, watching them come to a peak, folding in the fillings\u2014it was all so cool. I didn\u2019t realize you could do that much with an egg. So I went home and made fluffy omelets for everybody. Then I started looking at cookbooks, playing with chicken pot pie, stir-fries. My mom caught on and would let me do the grocery shopping and make dinner while she was at work. I\u2019d only get so much money each trip, but I learned to clip coupons and shop smart so that whatever cash I had left over would be my allowance. I didn\u2019t realize she was teaching me some real life lessons there, but she was.I always wanted to be a chef, but it never seemed possible because I\u2019d never seen a Black woman in that role. All I had to look up to was Julia Child and a bunch of white men. So instead I moved to Atlanta, became a flight attendant, traveled the world, and ate everything I could find: paella in Spain, adobo in the Philippines. It was exciting, getting to know different cultures through their food. In my free time I\u2019d re-create recipes for friends and family, dreaming of a career where all I did was cook.I was in my mid-30s and raising a two-year-old daughter by the time I finally enrolled in culinary school. There were no scholarship opportunities for people my age, so I doubled up on classes, finished in a year (valedictorian with a 4.0 GPA!) and got a job as a sous-chef straight out of graduation.\u00a0Two months into the job, we were catering this huge corporate event, and we were behind on prep. The chef went home, but I opted to stay through the night. By the time he showed up the next morning, I had everything lined up and ready to go. I thought he\u2019d be thankful, but instead he told me: \u201cI never would have hired a n-gger like you had I known how good you really were.\u201d Then he said, \u201cYou can run back and tell everybody I said that, but it\u2019ll be your word against mine.\u201d And that\u2019s exactly what happened. There was no recourse. I quit the next day.When you\u2019re Black in America, racism is a constant. And as a queer Black woman working in restaurants, I\u2019ve experienced it all firsthand. Sometimes it\u2019s action and sometimes it\u2019s words, but it all comes from the same place.On my better days I find happiness in the simple acts of cooking: methodically chopping vegetables; pan-frying chicken in cast iron like my grandmother taught me; following the handwritten chocolate chip cookie recipe my mom left behind after she died. In the kitchen I can sometimes forget there are people out there who see my skin color as a threat.Then I get that wake-up call\u2014maybe it\u2019s small, like a put-down from a white chef who feels threatened by Black talent, or maybe it\u2019s big, like a Black man murdered on camera for using a counterfeit bill\u2014and suddenly everything that\u2019s ever happened to me and the people I love based on the color of our skin comes flooding back. When things have been so wrong for so long, you tiptoe around them so they don\u2019t hurt you directly. And then one day they do.Illustration by Alexis EkeBy the time I opened my second restaurant in 2015, I was well-established. It\u2019d been 13 years since I closed my first one, Edible Art Cafe, but in the meantime I\u2019d accumulated decades of catering experience and a definitive style: soul food with a twist. I called my new restaurant Twisted Soul and built a menu out of the dishes I grew up eating, infused with the flavors of my travels and the skills I learned in culinary school. Cajun grilled chicken with crawfish butter sauce, cornbread-stuffed pork tenderloin, red bean ravioli\u2014this was food that told my story, not somebody else\u2019s. Food that reminded me why I wanted to be a chef in the first place.I rented a space in downtown Decatur, a city just east of Atlanta, because it was cute and walkable with lots of shops and restaurants. I hadn\u2019t spent much time there myself\u2014in fact, not many people I knew did either\u2014but I didn\u2019t question that at the time. I just thought I was going into a smaller version of Atlanta that was right next door.Almost as soon as we opened, I realized I was wrong. Some of the other big chefs in the neighborhood were young enough to be my kids, but because I didn\u2019t come up through their channels they didn\u2019t respect me. See, there\u2019s this thing in the industry where if you worked for known white chefs, if you came up through them, then you\u2019re all good. You\u2019re wonderful. But if you got there on your own, well, how the hell did that happen?Much like Black chefs themselves, soul food has never gotten the respect it deserves. People play down the influence African Americans had on the food of the U.S. and then try to take our traditions away from us. They cook soul food but call it \u201cSouthern food\u201d instead. When the whole sustainability thing got big, I watched the dishes we\u2019ve been cooking for centuries become the popular items on all the white Southern chefs\u2019 menus, as if they had never existed before. All the castoffs we grew up on\u2014neck bones and oxtails and hog heads\u2014were disguised and called different names. I\u2019d be at a festival with all these top chefs serving pork terrine on peppery crackers or whatever, and I\u2019m like, \u201cOkay, girl. This is the same stuff all the country people are boiling in big black kettles at the cookout.\u201dAs Black chefs we\u2019re always being asked to explain ourselves. I have to explain why I\u2019m putting macaroni in my paella, even though I learned from a lady in northern Spain who does the exact same thing. And then, if we stick to what we grew up on, we get asked, \u201cWhy is your food always soul food? Is that all you can do?\u201d Nobody asks an Italian chef that. Maybe the question should be: How do you do what you do?Of course there are Black restaurateurs all over the country who have succeeded in spite of everything, who started from the ground and worked our way up without any help. And everyone loves those stories. But when it\u2019s time for the neighborhood restaurant crawl, we don\u2019t get invited because we don\u2019t draw the type of crowd the other chefs are looking for. So they exclude us. And then put Black Lives Matter signs up in their windows.I\u2019ll say it now, flat out: I left Decatur because of racism. All those microaggressions over the course of my career: racism. It may be more insidious than getting knocked out by a cop\u2014it may be dressed up in nice liberal clothing\u2014but that doesn\u2019t make it any less racist. And I\u2019m done being quiet about that. I\u2019m done sugarcoating ugly truths because at 60 years old I no longer fear the repercussions of honesty. There\u2019s power in calling things what they are.Looking back now at all these experiences written down on paper makes me cry, but I know each one of them has only strengthened me, as a chef and as a person. I think about my mom dropping me off at an elementary school where I was one of only six Black kids because I tested into the accelerated program. How strong she had to be\u2014and how frightened\u2014watching her daughter as the only Black girl in the Girl Scout troop or at the sleepover. I think about my daughter, Kursten, who was a toddler when I went to culinary school, who has seen me fall to my knees, who has seen me get back up. Now, at 28, she\u2019s the general manager and beverage director at our new Twisted Soul location on Atlanta\u2019s Westside. She understands the importance of ownership, of building a foundation that can stick around for generations so that Black people can come into the world having something.I\u2019m no longer content just sneaking through the door; I\u2019m going to put my foot in it and hold that door open for the young Black chefs behind me.\u00a0The Westside of Atlanta is a mixed neighborhood with a welcoming spirit, a place where people who look like me don\u2019t just survive but thrive. And the new Twisted Soul is a safe space\u2014a space for positivity and communion and feeling good, both for the young Black chefs I mentor and the diners who eat with us. Come by and we\u2019ll serve you hoisin-braised oxtails and sticky sweet potato pone and the best fried fish you ever tasted. COVID-19 has changed things, but we\u2019re resilient. There may be a shortage of prime meats, but there are plenty of neck bones, and I\u2019ve always known how to make something beautiful out of the things no one else wants.These days I see resilience as a responsibility. The food industry has always needed more financing and mentorship for people of color, and now I can help with that. I\u2019m no longer content just sneaking through the door; I\u2019m going to put my foot in it and hold that door open for the young Black chefs behind me. That\u2019s why our leaders\u2014MLK Jr., John Lewis\u2014laid their lives on the line. To tell future generations: You don\u2019t have to stand for this.Now there\u2019s an army of young people out there. They are frustrated, but they are educated and strong and smart. They\u2019re leaving jobs where they\u2019re treated badly and starting their own things: restaurants and pop-ups and cooking shows on Instagram\u2014that\u2019s their pivot. And it\u2019s not just because of COVID-19; it\u2019s because opportunities have never been offered to them. So they\u2019re learning to exist outside of the traditional power structures. They\u2019re shaking up the institutions. They\u2019re protesting out in the streets.Here in the restaurant world, those changes are reverberating. White chefs have always set the rules, but it\u2019s time to question them. Maybe the little white man from Kentucky on the side of that bucket isn\u2019t the authority on fried chicken. Maybe that biscuit recipe didn\u2019t come from your grandmother but an enslaved person somewhere down the line. Maybe French cuisine isn\u2019t the standard. Maybe we need to kick the damn door down. And maybe, on the other side, there are possibilities beyond what we\u2019ve ever imagined.Deborah VanTrece is an award-winning chef and owner of the restaurant Twisted Soul in Atlanta.
