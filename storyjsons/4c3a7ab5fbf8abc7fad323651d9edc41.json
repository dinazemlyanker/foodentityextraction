Save the trim of making cauliflower rice or roasted florets.Ingredients2 servings1medium head of cauliflower3Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil, dividedKosher salt, freshly ground pepperPlain whole-milk Greek yogurt and Coconut-Turmeric Relish (for serving; optional)PreparationStep 1Preheat oven to 400\u00b0. Remove the toughest outer leaves from cauliflower (leave the tender inner leaves) and trim stem. Resting cauliflower on stem, cut in half from top to bottom, creating two lobes with stem attached. Trim off outer rounded edge of each piece to create two 1\u00bd\"-thick steaks; reserve trimmed off florets for making cauliflower rice or roasted cauliflower.Step 2Heat 2 Tbsp. oil in a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high. Cook cauliflower, gently lifting up occasionally to let oil run underneath, until deep golden brown, about 5 minutes. Add remaining 1 Tbsp. oil to skillet, turn steaks over, and season with salt and pepper. Cook until second side is golden brown, about 3 minutes, then transfer skillet to oven. Roast just until stems are tender when pierced with a cake tester or toothpick, 8\u201312 minutes. Let cool slightly.Step 3If using relish, swipe some yogurt over each plate and place a steak on top. Spoon one-quarter of relish over each. Season with more salt and pepper.Read More: The 29 New Essential Recipes from the Bon App\u00e9tit Test KitchenHow would you rate Cauliflower Steaks?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (2)Back to TopTriangleP.S.
