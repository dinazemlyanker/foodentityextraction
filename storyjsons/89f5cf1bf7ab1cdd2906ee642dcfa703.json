I had read that owners Evin and Evrim Dogu source grains from local farms and then mill them in house to create a more intense, unique flavor in their baked goods. But seeing everything IRL was almost overwhelming (in the best way). There were plump loaves of sesame rye perched like trophies on the wall. Glossed morning buns, whose layers of pastry were coiled together tightly like a slinky. Even the lighting was perfect, casting this beautiful, sun-freckled shadow over everyone\u2019s breakfasts. But the thing I fell the hardest for was the quiche.I\u2019m not the kind of person who goes to a bakery and orders the quiche. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t like quiche. It\u2019s just that I have other priorities. I\u2019ll do a croissant, a cookie, or even a cake (better indicators of a bakery\u2019s abilities, I\u2019ve always thought) before I\u2019ll go for the quiche. But when I asked the woman behind the counter what everyone in the bakery loved the most, she immediately gestured toward the quiche. The ingredients change regularly, she explained. Today\u2019s were fennel and onion. So I tacked on a quiche to my order. It arrived warm, the top slightly puffed and golden brown, buttery crumbs falling off the sides. The interior had that custard-y creaminess. The slices of onion and fennel had practically melted into the egg. The crust was light. Most importantly, the ratio of crust to filling was exactly right\u2014neither element overwhelmed the other. I forgot about everything else I had ordered, and turned my attention squarely on polishing off that quiche.Later that day, I Instagrammed my morning bun because it was the prettiest picture I had taken at the bakery, with the laminated layers catching the light streaming through the window. Sure it was something to admire, but really, all I was thinking about was the quiche.Go there: Sub Rosa BakeryExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendRichmondRead MorerestaurantsWhere to Eat in Richmond, America\u2019s Next Great Restaurant-Obsessed TownGallery9 SlidesBy Stephanie GanzRecipes you want to make.
