In a city with so much excess, sights to see, wonders to absorb, I keep my list small. And at the top of that tight, practiced list lies my favorite bar in the city, a mandatory stop where Singapore Slings, Zombies, and other extravagantly garnished tiki drinks can be found: Frankie\u2019s Tiki Room.Frankie\u2019s is one of those places that couldn\u2019t exist anywhere other than where it does, in a graceless stucco block next to a gas station, a couple miles northwest of the Strip. The massive Miami Vice-esque pink neon sign illuminates the parking lot below, but when you enter the bar, that\u2019s when Frankie\u2019s allure begins to take hold. It\u2019s dark. It smells like someone has been continuously ashing a cigarette onto the floor since the \u201850s, when Frankie\u2019s was a non-tiki mob hangout. Old Hawaiian tunes seep out of the jukebox. Artificial palm leaves drape around the bamboo-clad architecture. And people are drinking.Those drinks\u2014whether you opt for a tiki classic like a Fog Cutter or a Frankie\u2019s original like Surf Dragon (rum-based and filled with flavors of strawberry and violet) or a Frankenstein (golden rum, ginger liqueur, lemon, papaya, and fresh raspberries) are strong. But having just one is not and never has been the move here. Strength is only part of the appeal. The main reason you\u2019re ordering another round is because the bartenders know\u2014and have known for over a decade\u2014exactly what they\u2019re doing with the sweet, punchy, fruity flavors that make for a brilliant tiki drink.When you go to Frankie\u2019s, you go to forget all the mistakes you made in this ridiculous city. And soak up the fact that you\u2019re in one of America\u2019s most amazing tiki bars.Go there: Frankie\u2019s Tiki RoomExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendBarsLas VegasRumRum DrinksRecipes you want to make.
