I arrived at the airport so late that I couldn\u2019t check luggage and ended up needing to buy a smaller suitcase from a pre-security kiosk. I figured it all out and eventually boarded my international flight with literally zero time to spare. Luckily, I\u2019d packed light since I knew the trip would involve a lot of shopping. Unluckily, the four giant bags of Chex Mix I\u2019d bought for my family (and to pad out my mostly empty suitcase) did not fit into my carry-on and were, regrettably, left behind.I\u2019d planned not to tell any of my relatives about my near miss with disaster, but I didn\u2019t quite anticipate their disappointment when the Chex Mix didn\u2019t arrive on schedule. I had to fess up, and my brother, who was flying out a few days later, was enlisted to bring the bags I had failed to produce. Although probably everyone else involved has forgotten this story, it wouldn\u2019t be completely inaccurate to say I have been trying to make up for my transgression ever since.Many immigrant families I know all have that one thing they bring their relatives when visiting from the U.S. For my grandmother in Delhi, it\u2019s Chex Mix. She will put it out on the coffee table in her living room, where everyone gathers, in small bowls during teatime and anytime anyone needs a snack. Sometimes it\u2019s nestled between plates of dhokla, sweet mithai, home-fried shoe-string potatoes, and other salty, crispy namkeen. Sometimes it\u2019s a solo treat. It\u2019s always beloved, but still, without fail, a week or so into a trip, someone will comment on how the best part of the mix is the rye chips, and everyone else will agree. We still eat all the rest of the mix, but you can definitely tell the rye chips are favored.Since my grandmother is never far from my mind (nor are my familial wrongdoings), I think about this a lot. So when I was recently deep in the middle of an online grocery order and came across Gardetto\u2019s Rye Chips, something sparked in my brain. Were these the rye chips my relatives loved? I promptly ordered a few bags to try and found them to be crunchy, garlicky, and delightful, an ideal snack situation. I think still there is something to be said for the mix: The cereals and pretzels allow the rye chips to really shine. (In fact, the garlic rye chips were originally a part of a snack mix from the brand Gardetto\u2019s, a Chex Mix competitor now owned by the same company before becoming a stand-alone \u201cspecial request\u201d product in 2006.) But whenever I finally get to go back to India, I\u2019ll be taking a bag of Gardetto\u2019s rye chips too in the hopes that I make up for the snacks I once left behind.Photo by Isa ZapataGardetto's Roasted Garlic Rye Chips$3 at Amazon$3 at WalmartExplore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingHighly RecommendCultureRecipes you want to make.
