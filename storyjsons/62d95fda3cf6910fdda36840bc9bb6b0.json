That\u2019s Why You Gotta Take Your Breakfast Burrito To-Go.And inside that burrito, there\u2019s a layer of fluffy egg that will change your burrito technique forever.By Alex BeggsMay 17, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Chelsie Craig,  Food Styling by Yekaterina BoytsovaFacebookTwitterEmailIn the Planet Earth Volume 4 documentary of my life, you\u2019d witness me staring into a bubbling skillet of eggs, my hair twisted in a towel, Walmart slippers looking a little worse for wear. And here she is, the American Female, trying to find something new to eat for breakfast.But then the music would abruptly transition from ambient aquatic sounds to a jazzy number\u2013Planet Earth\u2019s a musical now!\u2014because WAIT A SECOND SHE DID.She\u2019s making a breakfast burrito with an egg rolled up inside!!!So there she is, standing in front of the eggs, because that\u2019s all you need to do. Two, three eggs, whisked a little, and then left to bubble and solidify in the pan, 2-3 minutes. Then you flip the egg crepe creation. This flip sounds harder than it is, because flipping can be stressful. But even when I did a sloppy job, the side of the egg I\u2019d been cooking was forgiving, and I spread the egg crepe back into place with my spatula. A few seconds of cooking later, slide it onto a warmed tortilla.Optional, but are they, really?\nPhoto by Chelsie CraigFrom there, add your toppings\u2014cheese, avocado, sour cream, hot sauce, healthy green things\u2014and then roll the burrito in some aluminum foil. DO NOT skip this step. This makes the burrito convenient to stash and take to work, yes that\u2019s the point. But it also steams the eggs and melts the cheese. Steamed eggs are fluffy eggs, fluffy eggs are a goddamn delight. So even if you\u2019re eating at home, let it steam in there, slice it in half, and then un-foil your beautiful burrito. I\u2019ve made this three times this week, which is more than I can say for flossing.I used to softly scramble eggs with cheese, throw them in a tortilla, have a ball. But something was missing, and it was that complete layer of fluffy egg. You get egg in every bite; none of those dry all-tortilla bites. Curds of scrambled eggs don\u2019t fly out on a rogue mission for your cat to conquer. Maybe I\u2019m getting granular here, but that\u2019s sort of my job. Our job. To overthink breakfast. To turn breakfast into a moment so important, you\u2019d narrate it to yourself as you stand in front of the stove, thinking about your goals for the day, and if you\u2019ll need to pack an umbrella.Get the recipe:Breakfast Burrito to GoThe layer of fluffy egg inside will change your breakfast burrito expectations forever.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titBreakfastBurritoEggRecipes you want to make.
