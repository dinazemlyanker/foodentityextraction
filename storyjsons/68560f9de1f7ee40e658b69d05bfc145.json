I'd highly recommend them with the dried apples, although I've done it both ways and it was great. 10/10 Half Sour Saffitz!!Troy ScottAtlanta, GA2/3/2022Stellar recipe, finally something that's apple-y enough! Sometimes I make it without the crumble, and it's still great. AnonymousMichigan 5/21/2021Excellent. Very similar tasting to BA's best pumpkin bread. It was great served with yogurt as suggested.\n\n Some substitutions: I used gluten free flour with xanthan gum. I baked it in a 10 inch round springform pan and it took about 40 minutes that way. I also added a handful of chopped walnuts. \n\nI'll definitely make it again since I have apple butter and rings leftover.AnonymousWashington DC1/9/2021Absolutely delicious. I used apple chips in the recipe instead of the dried apple rings and used less than the recipe called for. Also I wasn't able to get the crumb topping to a crumb consistency, it was more of a glaze. But it was still really good. Anonymous4/24/2020This smelled so fragrant and winter-y in the oven, and the end result was incredible. Perfect crumb, great structure that was conducive to slicing, and absolutely heavenly flavor.AnonymousColumbia, SC1/11/2020Easy and tasty cake. Was a little worried the dried apple pieces would result in odd chewy bits within the cake, but they must have been hydrated a bit from the batter and didn't post a problem at all (I'll note that I even used very old dried apple pieces I had had hanging around in my cupboard).  Brought this cake over to a dinner party and the entire thing was consumed in one go, will def make again!
