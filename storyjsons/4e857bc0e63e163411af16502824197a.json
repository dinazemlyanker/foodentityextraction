Her \u201cChicali\u201d taco, a vegan version of the carne asada tacos sold across Mexicali, a city in northern Mexico where Vallejo\u2019s family is from, costs $7, on the higher side for the neighborhood.But people line up regardless. They\u2019re drawn to her food and her philosophy: that Mexican cooking can be vegan, and that rooting out animal-based ingredients is actually better for Latinx bodies.Vegan Mexican food as a concept isn\u2019t new in Los Angeles. But for years the cuisine has been positioned in wealthier, whiter neighborhoods on L.A.\u2019s west side, and not the Spanish-speaking communities east of and near downtown. According to the USDA\u2019s Food Access Research Atlas, nearly all of L.A.\u2019s food deserts\u2014low-income areas with limited access to supermarkets\u2014sit in heavily Latinx neighborhoods. Recently, a growing number of Chicana chefs have launched their own niche food businesses, evangelizing the benefits of Mexican vegan food with the city\u2019s Latinx populations in mind.Photo by Graham Walzer\u00a0Denise Vallejo, Alchemy Org\u00e1nicaVallejo, and others like her, push vegan food not only because of its health benefits (Latinx populations/communities nationwide have soaring rates of obesity and diabetes), but also because it\u2019s a way to reject the modern narrative of Mexican cooking as being heavy on cheese, meat, and lard.When she first went vegan in 2008, after her father had a stroke and her aunt was diagnosed with cancer, Vallejo got flack from her Mexican American friends who told her she wasn\u2019t being true to her heritage. Her response was to dig into the roots of Mexican cuisine and create the food that she wanted to eat. \u201cOnce you start researching the things we ate before the Spanish invasion, it\u2019s like, \u2018Oh, this is what we\u2019re supposed to eat.\u2019\u201d Before the conquest, the average indigenous diet would have included foods like tomatoes, squash, amaranth, corn, beans, and chiles. It wasn\u2019t until the Spaniards brought pork, sugar, and wheat in the 16th century that these ingredients were integrated into indigenous diets. \u201cPeople are getting sick all the time because they\u2019re eating too many colonial foods,\u201d Vallejo says.A huarache with mashed black beans, tofu queso fresco, crispy mushroom chicharr\u00f3n, cactus salad, and micro herbs.\nPhoto by Graham WalzerNow she sees more and more people lining up to eat her food at Alchemy Org\u00e1nica, which has occupied the same corner, painted with a cartoonish mural of her face, since October 2018. Vallejo, who lives nearby, offers a sliding scale for locals, the elderly, and people with EBT cards. But plenty of customers seek her out from her Instagram account and pay full price. She also hosts monthly multicourse vegan supper club dinners (tickets are $120 apiece) at private spaces around L.A., where she eschews mock meats and focuses on plants.It\u2019s an enticing puzzle to solve: How do you capture the essence of a dish you grew up with and love, without the ingredients that made you love it in the first place? \u201cI\u2019m on my own little mission, my own journey,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I\u2019m finding a lot of other people who are joining me on the path.\u201dPhoto by Graham WalzerJocelyn Ramirez, Todo Verde\u201cWhat you\u2019re trying to capture is the nostalgic effect that food has on our body, our brain, our emotions,\u201d says Jocelyn Ramirez, chef-owner of Todo Verde, an L.A.\u2013based vegan catering business and pop-up.Ramirez grew up eating a fair amount of processed food; her immigrant parents worked long days, she recalls, and were often too tired to cook. After struggling with her own health issues and supporting her dad through two bouts of cancer, Ramirez decided to start cooking plant-based meals for the whole family, tweaking her family\u2019s favorite Mexican and Ecuadorian dishes (Ramirez\u2019s father is from Ecuador.). They loved the food so much, they told her she should open a restaurant.In 2015 she launched a line of smoothies at three farmers markets on L.A.\u2019s east side and one downtown. The Brown Power, a mix of raw cacao, oats, kale, vanilla, dates, and almond milk, was an immediate hit; Ramirez said her customers told her it reminded them of Choco-Milk, the fortified Mexican chocolate milk powder ubiquitous in their childhoods. Today Ramirez and her 12-person staff cater weddings and private events and have a stall at Smorgasburg downtown. There, smoky mushroom tinga and jackfruit tacos smothered in her grandmother\u2019s earthy pipi\u00e1n rojo\u2014both served on freshly pressed, organic corn masa tortillas\u2014are the biggest sellers. On the catering menu, Ramirez puts a healthy spin on classic Mexican dishes, swapping in julienned squash for her fideo (a dish usually made with fried noodles), and black rice and golden raisins in her arroz con leche.Clockwise from top: Cremini mushroom tinga, jackfruit al pastor with salsa verde, oyster mushrooms en mole almendrado, and jackfruit with pistachio pipian verde and cashew crema tacos.\nPhoto by Graham WalzerShe says she\u2019s targeting a very specific customer\u2014Latinas from 24 to 35 years old who want to eat consciously but still want the food to taste somewhat familiar.\u201cPrior to the last few years, whenever you looked at the food companies in the health category, they were all geared toward white folks. You haven\u2019t really seen people of color becoming prominent figures within that space,\u201d Ramirez says. That presence\u2014and the food\u2014is striking a chord with her customers. \u201cThey\u2019re like, \u2018That person looks like me, that person looks like my family member, that food looks like what I eat at home.\u2019 It\u2019s a sense of connection that I think Latinos haven\u2019t felt in a long time.\u201dPhoto by Graham WalzerDesiree Flores, Dear Mama LADesiree Flores didn\u2019t initially embrace veganism to be healthy. At 17 she\u2019d watched a documentary about the mistreatment of animals and workers at factory farms, and what she saw convinced her to eat plant-based foods. After becoming vegan, however, she became starkly aware of how few food options were available in her community.She started to make tortas for herself and friends, and then in 2016, she cooked lard-free jackfruit tamales in salsa roja for a local underground supper club, the now-defunct Green\u2019s Center for Plant Based Nutrition. Encouraged by the positive reception, she made a second appearance, with a jackfruit version of her grandmother\u2019s birria, spooned into tacos and topped with a crunchy red cabbage chipotle slaw. She launched Dear Mama LA, her vegan pop-up and catering company, shortly thereafter. Then in August, Flores and some friends created Veganos en East Los, a monthly plant-based pop-up event featuring food vendors and artists across East L.A. and Boyle Heights. The first event drew nearly 300 people, surpassing her expectations.The Mulita de Birria.
