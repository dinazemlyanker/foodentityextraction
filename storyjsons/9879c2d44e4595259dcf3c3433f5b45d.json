Read all the stories here.At dinner parties, getting the mood right is just as crucial as getting the food right. That\u2019s where music comes in. Sure, you could eat in complete silence if you want to depress your guests. Or you can curate some tunes to get the party going in a way that\u2019s so memorable that guests come up to you with the ultimate ego-stroking question for any DJ: Can you send me your playlist?Are you hosting a cozy gathering with close friends? A giant feast with dozens of people and plus-ones? We\u2019ve sifted through our Spotify accounts to find the perfect party playlist for your needs. These are playlists that we\u2019ve used at our own dinner parties, so they\u2019ve already been guest-tested and approved.For the Pajama Party PotluckContentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\u201cAs a Taurus, I was literally born to curate comfy vibes for an evening at home with good friends and even better food. I first made this playlist for a holiday pajama party potluck I hosted where guests were encouraged to BYOB (bring your own blanket). It\u2019s an eclectic mix of chilled-out tunes that pairs well with a hearty pot roast, some boozy eggnog, and a warm slice of pound cake. If you\u2019re the eccentric kind of host who puts out a face mask bar and likes the playlist jumping from Erykah Badu to Modest Mouse to Shaggy, we\u2019re birds of a feather.\u201d \u2014Chala Tyson Tshitundu, assistant editorFor the After-PartyContentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\u201cHosting a dinner party in the evening and a party party later that night? This playlist, heavy with R&B and hip-hop, seamlessly transitions from a slow, \u201cgooey\u201d vibe to an upbeat, bouncy energy. It\u2019s engineered to make you shovel those last bites of dessert, get up, and dance. I started this party playlist right around the same time I moved into a new apartment in New York with six other strangers, and I fell into their weekly roommates dinner party tradition during quarantine that brought us all closer together. One day they designated me to curate music that would help us forget about that food coma, and we\u2019ve been using this one ever since.\u201d \u2014Julia Duarte, art assistantFor the Not-Christmas FestivitiesContentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\u201cChristmas isn\u2019t really my holiday\u2014I\u2019m not religious, and I\u2019m lukewarm on capitalism. But I do love the trappings of Christmas. The scent of pine. Hot buttered rum. Cozy dinner parties that end around a roaring fire. And during these dinner parties, I want to be listening to songs that sound like Christmas but aren\u2019t literal Christmas songs. Don\u2019t know what I mean? \u201cEveryday\u201d by Buddy Holly is a classic piece of non-Christmas Christmas music. Ditto Kate Bush\u2019s \u201cArmy Dreamers,\u201d Cocteau Twins\u2019 \u201cLorelei,\u201d or any song ever from an Icelandic musician. Cue up my playlist \u201cA Very Secular Xmas\u201d (shout out to my collaborators Emily and Liz!) and get in the holiday late-December spirit.\u201d \u2013MacKenzie Chung Fegan, senior commerce editorFor the ~Cultured~ Cocktail HourContentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\u201cMy college roommate was an editor for our campus music magazine\u2014so I was usually the one handling playlist curation. His taste leaned a bit too specific, with every band\u2019s introduction requiring a mini lecture on what actually constitutes Midwestern emo or where the always-shifting border of hyperpop currently rests\u2014a one-sided chat you can only have so many times. In this playlist, I attempt to soothe the snobs with cuts from the Talking Heads and William Onyeabor (influential, but not way too obscure) while sprinkling in some indie faves like Haim and Japanese Breakfast that anyone would be hard-pressed to roll their eyes at, keeping vibes upbeat, synthy, and fun. Feel free to dip once 100 gecs comes on; the conversation\u2019s only going downhill from there.\u201d \u2014Nico Avalle, digital production assistantFor Dining Alfresco in the Balmy Breeze (or Imagining It)ContentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\u201cHollywood and Instagram and a billion cookbooks (and my own stomach) have successfully convinced me that Southern Italy is a promised land when it comes to long, gorgeous dinners that are sumptuous in both look and taste. Since I can\u2019t jet off to the Gulf of Salerno at the moment, I\u2019ve brought its summery vibes to my own apartment. Listen to this highly specific playlist, full of vintage bops by Italian singers, to evoke a meal out on a bougainvillea-covered balcony in a little town overlooking the Tyrrhenian Sea. You\u2019re pouring glasses of limoncello for the table. George Clooney is one of your guests. You\u2019re very rich!\u201d \u2014Karen Yuan, lifestyle editorFor Date NightContentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\u201cA wedding reception is...basically a giant dinner party, right? I spent hours sifting through the tunes of mine and my husband\u2019s many lifetimes in order to curate a playlist that evokes an airy romanticism studded with nostalgic gems. And I think I succeeded. This playlist is an audio-timeline of every little love story in our lives. I handpicked songs that symbolize moments we\u2019ve shared not only with each other, but also the love and memories we share with our guests. I have to say, I did shed a tear as I watched my closest friends and family sway and sing along to these beloved melodies while they went in on plates of tandoori chicken.\u201d \u2014Mehreen Karim, recipe production assistantExplore Bon App\u00e9titCulturePartiesLifestyleDinner PartiesRecipes you want to make.
