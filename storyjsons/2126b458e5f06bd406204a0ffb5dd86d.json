This version of sambal goreng is my go-to, with tempe (spelled \u201ctempeh\u201d in English) that\u2019s fried until crunchy, nutty, and irresistibly toasty. You can think of this as your new favorite \u201cwhatever\u2019s in the pantry\u201d recipe and swap the vegetables or tag out the tempeh for another protein (diced chicken, thin slices of pork or beef, or firm tofu all work).\u00a0The heart of a good sambal goreng is the sambal itself, and this version is fragrant with ginger, garlic, and shallots, the tang of tamarind, and the defining warmth of chiles. If you can\u2019t find kecap manis, you can substitute it with a mix of 3 Tbsp. dark soy sauce mixed with 3 Tbsp. light brown sugar. For the tamarind concentrate or paste, you can mix 2\u00bd tsp. fresh lime juice with 2\u00bd tsp. light brown sugar. For those less keen on deep-frying, you can also pan-fry tempeh: Heat \u00bc cup vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook tempeh about 3 minutes per side, adding additional oil between batches if needed. \u2014Lara LeeAll products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Cut two 8-oz. packages tempeh into 1x\u00bd x\u00bc\" sticks with a chef\u2019s knife. Pour vegetable oil into a medium heavy saucepan to come 2\" up sides (but make sure pan is no more than two thirds full); clip a deep-fry thermometer to sides. Heat oil over medium until thermometer registers 350\u00b0. (If you don\u2019t have a deep-fry thermometer, check oil temperature by adding a cube of bread\u2014it should turn golden in 15\u201320 seconds.) Line a rimmed baking sheet with paper towels.Step 2Working in 2 batches and bringing oil back to temperature between batches, carefully lower tempeh into hot oil with a slotted spoon or spider. Fry, turning occasionally until golden and crunchy all over, 7\u20139 minutes. Transfer to prepared baking sheet to drain; season with kosher salt.Step 3Now make the spice paste.

Diamond Crystal or 1/2 tsp. Morton kosher salt in a food processor to make a coarse paste; set spice paste aside.Step 5Prep the vegetables. Thinly slice 4\u20136 red serrano or Fresno chiles. (If you\u2019re heat averse, go with the smaller number and scrape away seeds and membranes before slicing.) Trim 3\u00bd oz. green beans and slice into 1\" pieces. Remove ribs and stems from \u00bd large bunch Tuscan or curly kale (about 6 oz.); discard. Chop leaves into large pieces.Play/Pause ButtonPausePlay/Pause ButtonPausePlay/Pause ButtonPauseChevronChevronStep 6Bruise 2 lemongrass stalks with flat side of knife.

Is Brooklyn too Italian for fresno chiles? What the hell. And why can I find sambal in ever market but not kecap manis. Got it all together except Palm sugar and really enjoyed it! Thanks for sharing this recipe and making it vegetarian! ChrisBrooklyn ny1/17/2022Needs more palm sugar, maybe some lime, maybe fish sauceAnonymous12/20/2021Maybe it's my tempeh, but the recipe calls for salt, but I think it's a bit too saltly? Could be my tempeh doe? IDK! Be careful with the salt! It's a very delicious recipe though! A+!\nClaudia CMelbourne, Australia11/23/2021I love sambal goreng \u2014 i always get the sauce as an appetizer (w naan) at papparich, but this dish is absolutely not it. Really funky taste \u2014 SO bitter and so strange. It's missing something \u2013 it tastes nothing like sambal goreng.Anonymous7/17/2021Made as described, as part of my meal prep for the week. Tasted off, flavours just weren't great. I have two portions left in the fridge that I'm really not looking forward to! Do not recommend.CSLondon, UK7/12/2021This delicious but complicated to try for the first time on a weeknight! I was able to use significantly less oil by cutting the tempeh length wise to make for thinner pieces before frying in about a quarter inch of oil. Could not find kecap manis so used a little extra brown sugar. And just about doubled the vegetables. Would definitely make again - even my kids liked it! Katherine Brooklyn, NY 6/24/2021Sure\u2026 the ingredients aren\u2019t as readily available as most\u2026 but that is part of the fun! I was able to find everything I needed at my local (TORRANCE) H Mart! Super easy to make and very delicious. It feels like it should be harder to make. Husband loved it! Will make again!ManzieLos Angeles, Ca6/22/2021This looks delicious! I love tempeh but haven\u2019t cooked it in a long time - can\u2019t wait to try it out! I think that the recipe author has given a lot of possible substitutions for key ingredients that may be hard to find - kecap mania, tamarind, lime leaves - which makes it easier to throw this dish together with whatever vegetables or protein you have on hand. cohekoCanada 6/11/2021Could you air fry Tempeh/cbicksterAustin TX6/7/2021I was attracted by the concept of  a \"use it up\" recipe only to find that I had to LOOK UP the definition of several of the ingredients. Not a pantry friendly recipe any way you look at it.AnonymousCalifornia6/6/2021What a RIDICULOUS recipe to term as one you can make with whatever you have in the pantry!  I live in Asia and so have some of the ingredients but many of these ingredients are not everyday items that the majority of people keep in their homes.  You're really off-base here if you are really trying to offer your readers something they can make with what they have on hand.
