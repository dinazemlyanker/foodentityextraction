I was young, skeptical of additions to the holiday buffet, but became an enthusiastic convert: Dairy-rich and custardy, flecked with sweet corn, it felt like some kind of Turkey Day missing link. In this version the eggy pudding stays classic while other elements gesture southwest, with hominy adding chew, peppers offering warmth, and funky, crumbly Cotija turning the savoriness up to 11.\u201d \u2014Amiel Stanek, contributing editorAll products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Butter a shallow 3-qt. baking dish. Remove green parts from scallions and thinly slice; set aside for serving. Thinly slice remaining white parts. Heat remaining 6 Tbsp. butter in a large skillet over medium. As soon as butter stops foaming, add white parts of scallions, poblano chiles, and jalape\u00f1os and season with salt. Cook, stirring often, until very soft and liquid is almost completely evaporated, 10\u201312 minutes. Add hominy and corn to pan, season with salt and pepper, and cook until mixture is heated through and dry, about 4 minutes. Transfer vegetable mixture to a shallow bowl or rimmed baking sheet and let cool. (It doesn\u2019t have to be room temperature; it just shouldn\u2019t be so hot that it will cook the eggs in the custard.)Step 2Combine eggs, cream, sour cream, and 1 cup grated Cotija cheese in a large bowl; season with salt and pepper and whisk vigorously until mixture is smooth and foamy. Add hominy mixture and stir to combine; scrape into prepared baking dish. Bake pudding until mostly set but still a bit wet and jiggly in the center, 35\u201345 minutes; remove from oven.Step 3Heat broiler. Sprinkle remaining \u00bd cup grated Cotija cheese over pudding and broil until completely set and browned in spots, about 2 minutes. Let cool 15 minutes, then top with reserved scallion greens and season with more pepper. Serve warm or at room temperature.How would you rate Corn and Hominy Pudding?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (2)Back to TopTriangleDelicious and rich!
