But the best pan for eggs, hands down, is a nonstick fry pan. For impeccable omelets, creamy scrambles, and crispy fried eggs, I want a fry pan that's as slick as a greased-up air hockey table. Zwilling's Madura Plus nonstick frying pan is just that. I own the entire cookware set\u2014from a 6-inch pan for a single fried egg to the 11-incher I use for a Spanish tortilla.PHOTO BY CHELSIE CRAIGZwilling Madura Plus Nonstick Pan, 9.5-Inch$81 $65 at Zwilling$81 $65 at TargetThe forged-aluminum construction of these pans means they heat quickly on the stovetop\u2014a nice change of pace from a cast iron\u2014and they're compatible with all cooking surfaces, including induction cooktops, thanks to a magnetic plate on the bottom of the pan. The handle is coated in a sturdy layer of plastic so it stays cool to the touch even when cooking over high heat. (Don't throw it under the broiler, but it\u2019s oven-safe up to 300\u00b0 F for finishing or warming a frittata and up to 400\u00b0 F on the stovetop.)For maximum non-stick pan longevity, use a rubber spatula when scrambling eggs.\nPhoto by Ted CavanaughIt's the DuraSlide Granite nonstick coating that makes this the best pan for eggs I've ever used. Nonstick cookware either features a ceramic coating, which is made from clay or sand and sometimes has durability issues, or a layer of PTFE, commonly known as Teflon. DuraSlide is a type of PTFE coating that is incredibly scratch-resistant and, according to Zwilling, 40 times sturdier than standard PTFE-coated pans.If the word Teflon makes alarm bells go off in your head, know that much of PTFE's checkered reputation is because of perfluorooctanoic acid, or PFOA, a potentially harmful chemical that was once used in the manufacturing of PTFE. Zwilling's Madura Plus pan set is PFOA-free, and the production and use of PFOA has been prohibited in the United States since 2015.I breathe easier knowing that my egg-frying pans are high-quality and heavy-duty, but that doesn't mean I\u2019m reckless. They live by themselves in a cabinet where they will never get scratched. Stacking a nonstick skillet with other pans or cutlery beats the hell out of them, so after I'm done cooking eggs, I clean, dry, and put mine away in a place where they won\u2019t be touched by anything else. (They're dishwasher safe, but I recommend handwashing.) Zwilling says it\u2019s cool to use metal utensils on the nonstick surface, but I use a rubber spatula when I whip up scrambled eggs. Why run the risk? This babying prolongs their life span, and when I\u2019m talking about the best nonstick pans there are, I want them to live as long as possible. I want them to live forever.Better get that scramble juuust right.Explore Bon App\u00e9titWere Into ItTest KitchenToolsShoppingBA RecommendsStaff PicksRead MorecookingThe Cooking Pot You'll Never Want to Put in a DrawerBy Amiel StanekcultureThis Kitchen Tool Is Perfect for Anyone Who Cooks.
