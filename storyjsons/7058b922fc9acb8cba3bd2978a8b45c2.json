Instead, she and her fianc\u00e9, drummer and Devandra Banhart collaborator Gregory Rogove, turned to her friends Laurel Gallucci and Claire Thomas at Sweet Laurel, a Los Angeles baking company known for its floral-topped cakes free of grain, gluten, refined sugar, and dairy.Galucci and Thomas took Bacon\u2019s favorite chocolate caramel cake\u2014the base includes almond flour, super-dark heirloom criollo cacao, coconut oil, Himalayan pink salt, and maple syrup\u2014and frosted each layer with their almond-butter and date-based vegan caramel and a ganache that had been \u201cdusted\u201d with Moon Juice\u2019s Sex Dust. (The waitlisted blend of herbs is said to combat stress and boost energy and \u201cmale reproductive strength.\u201d)\u201cI really didn\u2019t care how it looked, just that it was delicious, potent, free of ingredients that would cause inflammation, and was made by a friend,\u201d said Bacon. \u201cI knew Laurel was the only person for the job. She could really appreciate a 90 percent cacao ganache and not be intimidated by the Sex Dust.\u201d\u201cAmanda and her family have always loved our chocolate caramel cake, and adding Sex Dust made it perfect for her wedding day (and night) lol,\u201d wrote Gallucci, who has seen an uptick in requests for Sex Dusted cakes. (In addition to being in demand in L.A., Sweet Laurel recently started shipping nationally.) She and Thomas hope to eventually add the Sex Dust cake to their regular roster.Amanda Chantal Bacon confirmed that her version was perfect and enjoyed by the whole party. \u201cWe were encouraged to consummate our marriage after being sent off to our suite with a box of Sex Dust cake,\u201d she added.No word on whether they remembered to freeze a slice.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishWeddingCakeTrendsRead MoreLifestyleThis Gluten-Free Carrot Cake Made BA Staffers Pretty Much Lose Our MindsBy Amanda ShapiroRecipes you want to make.
