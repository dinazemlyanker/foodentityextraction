That\u2019s right: This South Asian dessert checks all the boxes. While the world of barfi is vast and varied, we love this mango version because it\u2019s bright and tart, with tang, fruitiness, and a soft chew too. Using canned or frozen mango pur\u00e9e ensures a consistent level of sugar and moisture and means you don\u2019t have to wait for rock-hard fruit to ripen (or mango season to come). Choose the shape that\u2019s pleasing to you: We went for triangles, but it can also be sliced into bars or diamonds or simply rolled into truffles.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

As others mentioned, it never set and was too coconut forward. Won\u2019t make again. MizziBoston, MA3/25/2022Not thrilled with this recipe. Pressed it into an 8x8 inch pan. It's so crumbly like it never set up. Should I have used the really finely shredded desiccated coconut?AnonymousAustin, TX3/18/2022Awesome recipe but with no cardamom powder as an ingredient doesn\u2019t sound exactly authentic. I always associate cardamom with Indian sweets. I\u2019ll try it as a diabetic friendly recipe with evaporated milk and tiger nut flour. I\u2019ll let you know how it turns out.RitzeegalHouston, TX2/28/2022Explore Bon App\u00e9titDessertEasy5 Ingredients or FewerGluten-FreeSouth AsianAsianBar CookieCookieMangoStone FruitFruitCoconutLimeCitrusRecipes you want to make.
