Toast walnuts on a baking sheet, tossing once, until golden brown, 6\u20138 minutes. Let cool; finely crush with the side of a chef\u2019s knife.Step 2Place a medium skillet over medium heat and add \u00bd cup water. As soon as you see bubbles, add one-third of the spinach and cook, stirring occasionally, until most of the spinach is wilted, then add more. Continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until all the spinach is in the pan and wilted, 6\u20138 minutes. Transfer spinach to a bowl of ice water to stop the cooking and lock in its bright green color. Drain and squeeze out excess liquid. Finely chop spinach and set aside.Step 3Wipe out skillet and heat 2 Tbsp. oil over medium. Cook onion, stirring occasionally, until soft but without taking on any color, 6\u20138 minutes. Add garlic and a pinch of salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until garlic is softened, 2\u20133 minutes. Transfer to a small bowl.Step 4Heat remaining 4 Tbsp. oil in a small skillet over medium. Once oil begins to shimmer, remove from heat and stir in dried mint. The oil will sizzle immediately and the mint will become fragrant. Transfer to a small bowl; season with salt.Step 5Combine yogurt, lemon juice, onion mixture, half of the walnuts, and reserved spinach in a medium bowl. Taste and season with salt and pepper. Scrape\ninto a shallow serving bowl and use the back of a spoon to carve a few swirls into the dip. Top with remaining walnuts and spoon sizzled mint oil over.How would you rate Spinach-Yogurt Dip with Sizzled Mint?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (5)Back to TopTriangleI gotta admit that I really wasn't sure about this one as I was making it- but by the time I tasted it - it won me over. It's definitely way  more sophisticated and nuanced than the usual run of the mill spinach dip and a lot prettier. I served it  in a beautiful ceramic dish with a lid which did give it a bit \"wow\" factor.  That being said you swap convenience and time for that. Whether or not you and your guests will appreciate it  depends on yours/their degree of foodiness and preferences for novelty vs nostalgia.  Of note, we have a milk allergy in the house and I subbed in cashew yogurt. ALSO didn't have walnuts, so used pistachios instead (which I think made for a fantastic sub).  Maile KarrisSan Diego, CA12/26/2020My new spinach dip !  I used dried basil and nonfat greek yogurt because that was what I had, and it still came out amazing.  It's so much more flavorful but lighter than regular spinach dip which has cream cheese.  Next time, I would just add another handful or so of spinach.NeelSan Francisco, CA12/25/2020Awesome, make a day ahead as it tasted even better the next day. cevans63855Chicago5/6/2019Delicious!
