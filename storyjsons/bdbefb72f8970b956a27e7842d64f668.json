Using a sip-worthy broth means you can skip sauteing aromatics, and while the rice is getting creamy you can do all of the prep for a pesto-esque sauce. The only knife work required to make this weeknight stunner is slicing garlic to sizzle with pine nuts, black pepper, and a touch of citrus-y turmeric. \u2014Christian ReynosoThis recipe is part of Short Is Sweet, our collection of summer dishes that deliver a whole lot of deliciousness in 30 minutes or less.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Add rice and increase heat to medium-high. Cook, stirring, until grains are partially translucent, about 2 minutes. Add 2 cups broth and bring to a rapid simmer, stirring often. Add another 2 cups broth and bring to a simmer again, stirring often. Reduce heat to medium and add another 2 cups broth. Cook, stirring often, until broth has slowly come back to a simmer. Continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until broth is almost completely absorbed but rice is covered with a thick layer of milky broth, about 20 minutes. If rice is still too firm, add another \u00bd cup broth and continue to cook until tender, about 3 minutes more.Step 2Meanwhile, cook garlic, oil, and pine nuts in a small saucepan over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until garlic starts to turn golden around edges. Reduce heat to low and continue to cook, stirring often, until pine nuts and garlic are golden, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat; stir in turmeric and season with pepper (as much as you like!).Step 3As soon as the rice is tender, remove pan from heat and stir in remaining 2 Tbsp. butter; season with salt. Stir basil into risotto.Step 4Ladle risotto into shallow bowls and top with garlic\u2013pine nut oil and Parmesan.

One note flavor and not worth the effort, even despite all the fat from the butter and flavored oil. JJGall8/4/2021Delicious, pretty quick to make,  and super easy!  We'll definitely make this again. We had the leftovers for lunch later in the week and it was just as yummy!Jolene L. McLean, VA6/30/2021I just made and ate this and it is divine! The crunchy garlic and pine nuts take this to another level. It's also very easy. It is rich so you don't need a lot. I'm glad I cut the recipe in half. I will keep the pine nuts and garlic separate from the risotto to reheat and repeat!LPCharlotte, NC6/27/2021Delicious ... next time I'll cut the recipe in halfElizabethWilliamsburg, VA6/15/2021HOT DANG\n\nThis was so easy and so good. My basil plant is exploding and I was on the hunt for new (to me) recipes that would help me use it up. This hit the spot! I made one serving by cutting everything by a quarter, and the instructions were still spot on. I served it up with a quick pan fried pork chop and a Lillet spritz. Absolutely making this one again. Sarah TNew Orleans6/15/2021Yes, this is an easy way to make (what everyone believes to be a grueling task) risotto. This however is bland and boring. The garlic pine nut sauce it good when it's fresh out of the pan but having this for leftovers leaves much to be desired. BA has great risotto recipes - this is not one of them. alexnew york, ny6/13/2021Very simple and very good.  I didn't have turmeric but it was delicious without!  Good recipe to have in my back pocket.  Thank you!!!\nLongport FoxPhiladelphia, PA6/10/2021I loved this risotto! It was easy to make. I love the oil, garlic and pine nut sauce. I was pleasantly surprised how much the squeeze of lemon added. Leslie M.Sharon, WI6/8/2021It's a great risotto, and so easy. But the boiled-in-oil garlic and nuts - no. Just not necessary. Some sauteed garlic is ok, but no instruction to mince the pine nuts and the the oil-thing - nah.HILARYAsheville, NC6/6/2021I always thought that you had to sit and stir risotto forever. Now that I know you don't have to do that, I'm going to make this all the time.
