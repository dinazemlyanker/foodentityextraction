That\u2019s $23.71 more than a Betty Crocker SuperMoist vanilla cake mix at Target, and I am deeply sorry for introducing the word SuperMoist into your day. So, if their competition is another box cake mix, the Caker\u2019s boxed kits are shockingly expensive. But if you accept that they have more in common with a $50 cake from a high-end bakery than they do with an industrially produced mix that contains \u201cpropylene glycol mono and diesters of fatty acids,\u201d then they\u2019re actually a pretty great deal.The Caker is the brainchild of Jordan Rondel, a self-taught baker from New Zealand who bears a resemblance to a young, tattooed Jane Birkin. She opened her Auckland bakery a decade ago, selling beautiful but unfussy cakes with naked sides, strewn with fruit and topped with pert roses. Now living in L.A., she saw a market for her lemon strawberry poppyseed, flourless dark chocolate, and matcha cherry cakes\u2014but in mix form, without the stabilizers and additives found in many commercial boxed offerings.You\u2014yes you!\u2014can make this.\nPhoto by Liz BarclayThe fudgy and rich flourless chocolate cake is the runaway hit of the trio. Pop open the box and the price point starts to make sense. There\u2019s the pouch with the dry ingredients\u2014sugar, almond meal, and Dutch-process cocoa powder\u2014but there\u2019s also a bag of Callebaut dark chocolate callets and a sheet of edible gold leaf. Premium! You\u2019ll need to provide your own butter, eggs, and cake pan, but a handy precut circle of parchment is included. After 50 minutes of bake time (the instructions say 40, but I found all three cakes needed longer in my oven), the cake is ready to be speckled with gold leaf and served, if you so choose, with a dollop of lightly sweetened cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche (not included).The flourless chocolate cake is by nature gluten-free, and although the lemon strawberry poppyseed and matcha cherry cakes aren\u2019t, they too contain some almond flour. This lends all of the cakes a moist (dare I say, SuperMoist?) consistency with a dense crumb\u2014think custardy and tender, not light and springy. The poppyseed and matcha cakes can also be made vegan; simply swap in alt-milk and oil for cow\u2019s milk and butter. And while you will need to provide your own fresh or frozen fruit for the non-chocolate flavors, the kit includes everything you need for decorating. That\u2019s the gold leaf for the chocolate cake and a glaze and freeze-dried fruit for the other two. Even without Rondel\u2019s signature fresh flowers, the cakes look like they\u2019re straight from an expensive bakery. Who would believe a cake dripping in gold came from a box?Wini LaoThe Caker Cake Kits$25 at The Caker (Single)$150 $106 at The Caker (6-Pack)Explore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendShoppingproductCakeDessertRecipes you want to make.
