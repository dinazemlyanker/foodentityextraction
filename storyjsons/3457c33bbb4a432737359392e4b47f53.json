Ribs! Cobbler! WaJu!By Alex BeggsMay 25, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Alex Lau, food styling by Chris Morocco and Tom Cunanan, prop styling by Elizabeth JaimeFacebookTwitterEmailEvery Friday morning, Bon App\u00e9tit senior staff writer Alex Beggs shares weekly highlights from the BA offices, from awesome new recipes to office drama to restaurant recs, with some weird (food!) stuff she saw on the internet thrown in. It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.Sweet talkThis week we had our May cookbook club tea party featuring recipes from Stella Parks\u2019 BraveTart. Not to toot my own toot machine, but my homemade Nutter Butters were pretty amazing. (Cut to me, squeezing leftover peanut butter creme from a piping bag directly into my mouth while watching Game of Thrones Sunday night.) Rachel Karten brought in her cinnamony, perfectly chewy snickerdoodles; Emma Wartzman had us dunking pecan sandies in our jasmine tea; Emily Schultz used a candy thermometer for the first time for her picture-perfect fudge; Sarah Jampel made sky-high biscuits we ate warm, one of life\u2019s greatest pleasures; and Christina Chaey\u2019s homemade Fig Newtons coulda fooled me. Find the cookbook here to make those Nutter Butters yourself.Photo by Stephen Kent Johnson, Food Styling by Rebecca Jurkevich, Prop Styling by Kalen KaminskiA spritz is a good drinkI feel bad for Rebekah Peppler, who was just trying to tell the world to use slightly better ingredients in their summer spritzes. The headline to her New York Times article, \u201cThe Aperol Spritz Is Not a Good Drink\u201d got the world is freaking out in defense of a dang refreshment, an unnecessary food feud for us all! (Don\u2019t even try to pry my ros\u00e9 Aperol spritz out of my pink manicured fingers.) HOWEVER. At the end of the story, Peppler recommends a drink that\u2019s going to go on vacation with me this summer, the Amaro Spritz. Amaro, prosecco, club soda, squeeze of lime. I use Averna, a liquor made of fermented roots and other witchy business, which has this deep sweet and root beer-ish flavor, and obviously that\u2019s going to be good with decent bubbly wine and maybe a few dashes of bitters.Want this letter before it hits the website? Sign up for our newsletter!What\u2019s everybody making for Memorial Day?I\u2019m making Molly Baz\u2019s grilled chicken sandwiches for a crowd. Emily Schultz is making our best-ever ribs. Carla Lalli Music AND Sarah Jampel are making Claire Saffitz\u2019s new recipe for cherry biscuit cobbler. Jampel\u2019s adding on this easy onion dip, which I hard co-sign. Kate Fenoglio is making this crunchy and refreshing cucumber salad. \u201cSkewers! A lot of skewers!\u201d was all I got from Emma Wartzman. Aliza Abarbanel is bringing spicy kimchi slaw to a picnic. \u201cI\u2019m spending mem\u2019 day in Baja Mexico so you best believe I\u2019ll twisting up pitchers of WAJU,\u201d said abbrev-queen Molly Baz. Julia Kramer sent me a screenshot of her entire weekend menu, which included the green goddess crunch sandwich, salmon ni\u00e7oise salad, and BA\u2019s best buttermilk pancakes. Christina Chaey shook her head, \u201cI\u2019m not cooking a damn thing! It\u2019s vacation!\u201dA trip to Wine CountryI watched half of Netflix\u2019s Wine Country before I admitted it wasn\u2019t doing much for me. It just...wasn\u2019t funny? Maybe I wasn\u2019t the target audience. The movie, about a group of friends celebrating a 50th birthday, did portray the Napa winery scene as a caricature that rings too real: The wine people who want wine to be accessible to all, yet can\u2019t let go of their grape dogma. There are no wrong answers, a winery \u201cbarista\u201d says before shutting down someone who says she tastes \u201ccanned peaches.\u201d At an organic winery, a barista calls the sediment at the bottom of unfiltered wines \u201cwine diamonds.\u201d Another exchange: \u201cThis one\u2019s good, what\u2019s it called again?\u201d \u201cWhite wine.\u201d \u201cI love it.\u201dJamperoncinoContributing editor Sarah Jampel, a quiet, hardworking, wonderful human being, has become the victim of nickname hazing in the Test Kitchen. In the past week, she told me, she\u2019s been called \u201cJamperoncino,\u201d \u201cJampers,\u201d \u201cJampy McJamperson,\u201d \u201cJampy Jamporini,\u201d and had an upcoming strawberry cake recipe of hers declared \u201cJampelissimo!\u201dUnnecessary food meme of the weekUnnecessary food feud of the week\u201cThese snickerdoodles are SALTY,\u201d said Molly when she tasted our entire cookbook club buffet and gave her ((unsolicited)) critiques. That\u2019s when we found out that Rachel Karten, snickerdoodle queen, doesn\u2019t cook with the Bon App\u00e9tit Test Kitchen\u2019s zealously preferred Diamond Crystal Kosher salt, but Baleine kosher salt instead. \u201cThat\u2019s what they sell at my grocery store, okay?!\u201d she defended herself. \u201cI\u2019m going to give you Diamond Crystal as a housewarming present,\u201d replied a horrified Molly. That\u2019s when we found out that Alex Delany doesn\u2019t use D-C either, but Jacobsen kosher salt, ain\u2019t he fancy. \u201cAnyone wanna come clean on the iodized?!\u201d demanded Molly. \u201cI deff used iodized before working at BA,\u201d wrote Emily Schultz in a Slack confessional. \u201cIt\u2019s getting awkward in here,\u201d someone said, pulling at her shirt\u2019s collar. \u201cI use sea salt when I bake,\u201d noted Anna Stockwell. \u201cWhose using black lava salt? OUT WITH IT!\u201d screamed Carla Lalli Music. Amiel Stanek, who is known to lick any pink salt lamp he\u2019s ever encountered, chimed in: \u201cI only use Himalayan pink salt in large crystals that I grind in my salt grinder right before consuming. Freshly cracked is always better, you really get the flavor. All the...aromatic oils.\u201d I\u2019m pretty sure he was joking, but with Amiel, you never know.Explore Bon App\u00e9titBeggs NewsletterMemorial DayRead MorecookingChris Morocco Just Made the Best Chocolate Chip Cookie EverBy Alex BeggscultureCalamari Feuds, a Dog Treat Tasting, and a Really Good Asparagus RecipeBy Alex BeggscultureHow Really, Really Type A People Plan Their Weekend CookingBy Alex BeggscultureThe Slippery, Slimy Pasta That We Argued Over This WeekBy Alex BeggsRecipes you want to make.
