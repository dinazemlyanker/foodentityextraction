The tangy sauce overcame any fishy-ness, and I actually loved this!AnonymousSt Paul, MN8/10/2021I\u2019ve made this recipe multiple times, and it\u2019s now my favorite way to eat swordfish. Grilling the fish before marinating is brilliant! Use whatever herbs you have. It\u2019s always delicious. In winter I omit the tomatoes and it\u2019s still fabulous.
