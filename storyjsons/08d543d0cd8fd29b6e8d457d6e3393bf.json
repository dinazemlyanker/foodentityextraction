See our past recommendations here!Until recently, when I hosted a dinner party, I would set out paper towels as napkins without thinking twice. They\u2019re effective! Just wipe the food off your face and throw them away. But then someone gifted me a set of these hand-stitched, rosy pink linen napkins and, well, I\u2019ve never looked back.Chances are my guests never thought twice about the paper napkins either, but they certainly notice the cloth ones now, which come from Gjusta Goods in Venice, CA. (It\u2019s the shop attached to the all-day cafe Gjusta, where the L.A. vibes are on point.) Their linen napkins are super soft and the perfect size\u2014big enough to handle a messy, saucy meal without being unwieldy\u2014and easy to throw in the hamper when you're done. Best of all, they make my table look thoughtfully put-together, whether I've cooked dinner for six or ordered pizza to go. \u2014 Emma Wartzman, editorial assistant.Buy it: Gjusta Goods Linen Napkins, $62.All products featured on Healthyish are independently selected by our editors.
