This one is part of the Healthyish Guide to Being Alone, a month-long series of tips, recipes, and stories about how to be alone when we\u2019re together and together when we\u2019re alone.The world is always yelling at us to make BIG BATCHES of things\u2014even if you're cooking for one most of the time. But if, like me, you can\u2019t stand eating the same thing two days in a row (unless it\u2019s refried beans, I\u2019m not interested!), you're probably cooking in smaller quantities. Whenever I want a me-sized amount of dal, deep-fried tempura, or a big cozy mug of hot chai, I reach for my favorite piece of cookware in my entire kitchen: my Calphalon Tri-Ply 1.5-quart saucepan with glass lid. (Yes, the lid is critical for making rice, one of its most frequent jobs).Note that I said \u201cmy favorite\u201d and not \u201cthe most important.\u201d That\u2019s because, if I\u2019m being honest, I just bought this pot like, two months ago. Which means that for 31 years and 2 months of my life, I did just fine without a tiny pot in my cookware arsenal.But like the first time I made pour-over coffee with a gooseneck kettle, or strained the gunk out of my homemade stocks with a fine-mesh strainer, using this tiny pot has made almost all my solo cooking endeavors so much...better. Easier. More logical. I no longer end up with make awkwardly small servings in too-big pots\u2014this one is meant to feed just me. It\u2019s made of the heavy-gauge stuff (three layers of stainless steel and no fewer, thanks) that\u2019s meant to last a lifetime\u2014which is exactly how long I plan on keeping it around, whether I'm solo or not.Buy it: Calphalon Tri-Ply Stainless Steel 1.5 qt.
