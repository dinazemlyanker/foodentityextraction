Here are 10 of the best shrimp memes yet.By Rachel Karten and Emily SchultzJuly 12, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailFacebookTwitterEmailWelcome to Food on the Internet! A column from Rachel Karten and Emily Schultz, BA\u2019s social media team, dedicated to all the weird things we see while scrolling, double-tapping, and retweeting.\u201cShrimp memes 24/7,\u201d the Instagram bio reads. 214 posts. 2,333 followers. 83 following. Frequent use of #iodinepoisoningchallenge and #shrimp. This is @207poundsofshrimp.We found this meme account the way most people find meme accounts these days: in our DMs. A few months ago, Basically editor Amiel Stanek sent a @207poundsofshrimp post to Memey McMemerstien, a group DM with a few of our meme-loving co-workers. We laughed at the post and then clicked over to the account to investigate. What we saw stunned us. A singular meme about shrimp? Okay, sure. An entire meme account dedicated to the swimming crustacean? This  \ud83c\udf64 must \ud83c\udf64be \ud83c\udf64 for \ud83c\udf64 true \ud83c\udf64 scampi \ud83c\udf64 fans \ud83c\udf64 only.But unlike how, say, the account @throwbackmachine is niche in that it appeals to people who miss Beanie Babies or how @barstoolsports appeals to men who wear Sperry Top-Siders, @207poundsofshrimp isn\u2019t necessarily for people who order shrimp all the time. It represents something bigger. (Stick with us.) @207poundsofshrimp is the perfect parody of meme culture on Instagram. It turns the idea of a single-topic meme account on its head and applies all of the most popular tropes to the EXTREMELY focused topic of...shrimp. That meme you just \u201cliked\u201d on @thefatjewish's page? There's probably a shrimp-ified version on @207poundsofshrimp. Which is why we immediately hit \u201cfollow.\u201dHere, friends and shrimp lovers, are 10 of our favorite posts:Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Emily Schultz: I really like the watermark placement. Also the Meghan Markle memes will never get old to me because no, my mans is not the Prince of England.Rachel Karten: The fact that #iodinepoisoningchallenge is used right next to #royalwedding is a very important part of this meme. This is also a good time to address the name of this account. 207 pounds of shrimp is approximately the amount that will give you iodine poisoning. Dark!*Editor\u2019s note: Rachel and Emily have both never been to Red Lobster.Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.ES: Aside from Room Raiders or NEXT!, Pimp My Ride was my favorite MTV show from the early 2000s. I have a soft spot in my heart for Xhibit. And memes. And shrimp.RK: Someone once asked for a chocolate fountain in their trunk on Pimp My Ride, so I actually feel like this one is plausible. Would drive.Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.ES: This is my favorite post. This is my favorite meme format. It never gets old. Every meme in this style is the dad dissing the son about where he was conceived. Kinda rules. I\u2019m chuckling to myself silently as I write this.RK: I had to ask Emily to explain this one to me. Which is probably an HR violation of some sort.Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.ES: The car salesman meme is everywhere in the black hole that we call the Internet right now. It\u2019s a car salesman trying to sell you a crappy car saying, \u201cThis car can fit so much [whatever you may seemingly like] in here,\u201d and obviously you will fill it with shrimp. But 207 takes the car out of the equation, which brings this meme to an entire different solar system.RK: Unlike everything else in life, the crappier a meme looks, the better. \u201cOfcolon\u201d is essentially one word here and reads like it\u2019s a new character on The Handmaid\u2019s Tale.Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.RK: Guys! This is the cover art for a very real song that was written in 1924. The chorus begins with, \u201cDo shrimps make good mothers, yes they do. Have they lots of lovers fond and true.\u201d Was this song the ORIGINAL shrimp meme?ES: I\u2019m sorry, WHAT?Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.RK: Emily Slacked me \u201cis this dwayne the rock johnson\u201d along with this link. Yeah, it is. He\u2019s the best. Also shout out to @myinstagrow for commenting on this post: \u201cWhat\u2019s your favorite book on business?\u201d Well, since you asked nicely, it\u2019s this.ES: UNPOPULAR OPINION, I DO NOT LIKE DWAYNE \u201cTHE ROCK\u201d JOHNSON. So when I saw this I knew I had to include it to stir up some controversy. That\u2019s all. Bye.Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.RK: What is \u201cA small child\u2019s shrimp\u201d though?ES: Are there certain McDonalds that sell shrimp?Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.RK: The Office and @207poundsofshrimp is the best collab since Eminem and Dido. Don\u2019t @ me.ES: I really want 207 to do something with the still of Michael Scott in the convertible saying \u201cIt\u2019s Britney, Bitch\u201d. Or where Kevin drops the chili, but with shrimp.Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.RK: In the comments, @brycemotch tags friend @missjessica_612 and writes \u201cbetter be following this MF SHRIMP MEME PAGE.\u201d Hell yeah, only-posts-photos-of-cars-Bryce.ES: This one combines two good memes, AKA the bus driver kiss one (shrimp from strangers > kisses from strangers) and the Hotline Bling one. Two shrimp memes for the price of one. Hell yeah.Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.RK: This meme got me thinking: Is there a legal cutoff? Well, six years ago an important question was asked on Reddit: \u201cHow much shrimp would I have to eat at Red Lobster\u2019s \u2018Endless Shrimp for $15.99\u2019 promotion to make it a net financial loss for the restaurant?\u201d One person replied, \u201cMy friend who works there says the record he witnessed was 782 shrimp. The guys also there for 5.5 hours.\u201d Wait, was that customer...207POUNDSOFSHRIMP, THE EARLY WORK?!ES: The Internet is so good.
