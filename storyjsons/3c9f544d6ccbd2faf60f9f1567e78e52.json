If you like it find the cookbook.FAWNY, NyY10/26/2021I love this and I've made it so many times! Now that I've seen the comments I might try it the traditional way too.AnonymousVancouver, Canada1/14/2021Now that I see the comments will definitely try the more traditional versions.brushjlsolon, oh12/17/2020Agree with the comment below - this recipe lacks umami/seasoningAnonymousVancouver5/1/2020I love you Bon Appetit, but I\u2019m sorry this recipe is seriously lacking. I would recommend following a more traditional approach with the broth base by adding kelp, anchovies, daikon, and green onions to help create the umami that\u2019s missing.SylveeuhLA9/23/2019OMG, this recipe was spot on for me! Thank you, thank you, thank you Sohui Kim and Bon Appetit!!! The kimchi I used was store bought (eek!!) so the spices were already there, but this was a definitely bowl of comfort just as Sohui Kim said!!!AnonymousAcworth, GA4/26/2019So where is a recipe for the Kimchi???AnonymousTX3/10/2019Thanks for the tips. I used spicy kimchi and didn\u2019t worry about the paste as the previous commenter recommended. A little salt was perfect. Thanks for the tip!AnonymousChicago 3/9/2019I\u2019m not trying to be pedantic here, but traditionally, kimchi jjigae would not have any gochujang in it. Some people add dwenjang (korean miso paste?) depending on the flavor of the kimchi, but we usually don\u2019t add gochujang. We normally use salt for seasoning. Anyways, I\u2019m really happy to see more Korean recipes on here! I\u2019ve always loved Bon Appetit, but I think I love it even more now.
