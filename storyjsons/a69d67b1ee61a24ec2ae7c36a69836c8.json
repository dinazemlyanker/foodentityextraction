Using intact dried chiles instead of jarred powders contributes a more complex flavor and a saturated color. Adding lager imparts just the right amount of bitterness, rounding out the chiles.

Once you have this under your belt you are free to improvise around the edges. This time around I added tomatillos. The chili puree can be tweaked endlessly. Grind the best cumin seeds you can find, use Mexican oregano. Fry it all in Bison tallow, use the best fat you can find, use bacon fat. Use maple syrup instead of sugar, balsamic instead of apple. It's time consuming and labor intensive but when you truly grasp what serarates this technique from a typical chili recipe you will have learned an important lesson in cooking, one that applies across the board in every cuisine. Robert HaavieNew York1/23/2022Just tried this for the first time and won a little chilli competition. I had to make a few slight adjustments, I added 2 cans of kidney beans because, well this is chili after all. I also didn't have the same peppers available so I substituted Serrano and put them in with the garlic. \nIt was a big hit.MACThe Ozarks of Missouri12/19/2020I get so many compliments every time I make this, and frankly, they are deserved.  This recipe is just a total winner.  linkin22luke6400Denver, Colorado10/9/2020hands down one of the best chili recipes i've found!!! i never follow cooking recipes to the tee, i'm a natural improviser but i have always used this as a reference point and my chili comes out on point every timesheisflamemojiDallas, TX4/20/2020Make this recipe, it's delicious! It has a deep, developed flavor and is very filling. I could only find dried pasilla chiles in my local grocery store so that's what I used. Favorite toppings: crushed fritos, sour cream, diced red onion, shredded cheese and pickled jalapenos! whitneybPORTLAND, OREGON3/20/2020This chili is amazing!! Though I will also say that I think it takes a lot better the 2nd and 3rd day than it does the first. Give that chili time to marinate in it's own deliciousness! hhastingsPortland, Oregon1/16/2020Made it today. Followed the recipe. No changes. Pretty good. Not amazing. I was looking for a bean-less recipe because not everyone in my family likes beans. More like meat soup than chili. Could use some vegetables, perhaps. Or serve it over cornbread. The flavor is unique and good. And the process with the peppers is a good one to know. Definitely reusable in other recipes and a nice alternative to chili powder. Only other thing is three T of brown sugar is probably too much. shawnmizeMidwest12/28/2019This recipe is virtually perfect. Balanced in all the right ways and exceptionally beefy. Followed the recipe exactly and it yielded an end result that people scraped the bottom of the pot for. You won me a chili cook-off, thanks Claire!Not-a-goatThe North11/30/2019This recipe is fantastic! I make it at least a few times a year (started the month it was published) and my guests applaud it. I'm so happy to find a recipe that doesn't require me to toast the chiles -- I still haven't gotten that down!\nQuestion: instead of soaking the chiles in a bowl and transferring them to a stand blender, couldn't you just start them out in the stand blender and soak them there? Is there any reason not to? Thanks!AnonymousTexas10/30/2019Ground beef chili is an abomination. This here is the real thing. Beautiful. JeromeFMidwest8/28/2019The absolute best chili I have ever had. I took it to a chili cook off and I had NO leftovers. I will never make another chili again siennafrancescaCalifornia 4/14/2019This chili is fantastic! So flavorful and hearty. AnonymousCalifornia3/2/2019made this recipe for a party and literally everyone said it was the best chili they had ever had. One person said she didn't usually even like chili, but asked me for this recipe because she wanted to make it. \n\nMy wife likes beans in chili, so we made half of it with beans, and it was a totally fine addition. \nAnonymousLos Angeles2/5/2019This recipe was to die for. I will honestly never make another chili again. Everyone that was at my little football party was raving about it, calling it the best chili they've ever had. HIGHLY recommend. If you're concerned about spice (my fiance has heartburn problems), just cut the amount of peppers in half. These particular peppers are not super spicy, just flavorful and smokey. sbalashMassachusetts2/1/2019We've made this several times now and it's by far the best chili recipe ever. Full stop. We live in the UK at the moment so swapped chilis for what we could find (used a mix of red and green chilies, jalape\u00f1os and scotch bonnet peppers). It has the perfect amount of heat, warmth and sweetness. Highly recommend.
