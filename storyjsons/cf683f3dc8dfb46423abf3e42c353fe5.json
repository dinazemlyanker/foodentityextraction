Food styling by Pearl Jones.EmailPinterestPrintEmailPinterestPrintCooking the annual New Year\u2019s Eve lasagna de carne \u201cwas always Mami\u2019s territory\u2014until the year I had no choice but to take over,\u201d writes author Elizabeth Acevedo in this essay. In a time of uncertainty in her family, she learned to make the lasagna to \u201cgrasp onto a bit of comfort and routine.\u201d This Dominican lasagna packs a wallop of flavor from herby sofrito, which cooks with the ground beef until toasty and caramelized. Stick to regular dried lasagna noodles; they offer a toothsome texture that no-boil noodles can\u2019t match.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

I followed the recipe exactly except for adding a few more noodles. I liked the meat to cheese ratio; many standard lasagna recipes are too cheesy for my liking. My teenagers were surprised by the smell (one kid thought we were having a Mexican dish based on aroma coming out of the kitchen) and they immediately tasted the cilantro. Jenn LNYC1/17/2022Fabulous recipe.  All the proportions were right and the taste was wonderful.I added a 5 oz bag of shredded parmesan.  I'm sending two portions over to my dear friends to celebrate New Years day.\n Marion Laguna Beach1/1/2022The meat sauce is really good. I feel there just isn't enough for the recipe. The same with the mozzarella, too little for the layers. \n\nIf I make again I will adjust to have more sauce. \n\nThank you for the recipe. \nJoshMinneapolis, MN12/26/2021Overall super yummy recipe! Easy to follow and a new twist on classic Italian flavors. It took my husband two days to figure out there was cilantro in it. I added a layer of cooked spinach to the recipe, super nostalgic ingredient for me. Will be making again. Bree HansonLos Gatos, CA12/9/2021This recipe is terrific and will become the NYE special. My son was diagnosed as paranoid schizophrenic 30 years ago and chose to take his life in 2000. It was, and continues to be traumatic for our family, however, I believe this lasagna will be a small savior added to our memory bank. \n\nThank you, Elizabeth. Anonymous12/5/2021Very tasty, will certainly make again.  Wish BA would tell us about the pans they use in the pix !!   That pan is cool looking.DrewRichmond, VA12/2/2021So delicious. It was gone within the half hour. Make sure you really cook the chuck until the liquid has evaporated and it\u2019s crumbly and crispy. Enjoy!NatMiami12/2/2021what makes this especially good is the heartfelt Dominican family reference.
