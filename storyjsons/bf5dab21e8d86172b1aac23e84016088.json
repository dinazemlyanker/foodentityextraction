It was absolutely delicious! The only thing I changed was using broccolini instead of broccoli rabe (after seeing a few reviews that commented on bitterness). It was perfect. My husband and I gobbled it up along with some toasted bread. I made fish that night too and hardly ate any because this dish was so delicious. Thanks BA!amyamyHouston, TX2/15/2022One of the few recipes from Bon Apetit that fails. The cooked double concentrated tomato plus broccoli rabe makes for an extremely bitter dish. The beans are lackluster and the dish desperately needs some brightness. Sad I wasted a good homemade pit of beans on this dish. It completely lacks flavor and depth. Don\u2019t waste your time. AnonymousSanta Fe 2/11/2022This is winner and is my new favorite WFH lunch.  I made the following small adjustments based on what I already had: 1 tbsp Red Boat Fish Sauce instead of anchovies, 1 tbsp Calabrian chili paste instead of flakes and smoked mozzarella.  I think the smoked cheese put it over the top and highly recommended.  Even my partner, who is not a huge cheese lover enjoyed it.JodiNYC2/1/2022Modified the recipe a bit. Followed Step (1) as show\u2019s.. However, I removed the Broccoli Rabe from the pan. Then added the tomatoes, reserved tomato liquid etc. Let it cook down to a tight sauce. Added beans with it\u2019s juice and let it cook down a bit to meld flavors. I then added the broccoli rabe. Let it cook another 5 mins. Sprinkled with Parmigiano and Mozzarella Broiled as above. Came out fantastic.Anonymous1/29/2022Tried this last night.  Didn't have the rabe so substituted with some Tuscan kale and a couple of left over Bok Choy bunches.  Did the beans in an instant pot with bay leaf/S&P.  Loved the umami flavouring that the anchovies brought in so basically, this worked great, no leftovers as we scraped our pan at the end.  Left it in the broiler to get a bit more charring on the cheese too.  It's on the To-Make-Again list!Bruce TCalgary, AB1/27/2022Broccoli Rabe should be cooked in boiling water for at least 15-20 minutes because in it's raw state it is very peppery and very bitter.  HeidiMNYC1/26/2022I made this despite the tepid reviews. I have to say... meh. It REALLY needed a hit of acid so I made everything as written but then added some lemon to the dish on the plate. It's just ok. I feel like it was lacking a kick too- the chili flakes weren't enough for a spice lover. I think some Aleppo peppers or something might be nice. But mostly, it cried for acid.  I don't think I'll be making this again. ShazzizNYC1/22/2022So bitter! I followed the recipe and did not make any adjustments or substitutions. Would not make again. The idea of it sounded so good, though. I see some people has this same issue and others did not. Not sure what I could have done wrong. AmyFort Lauderdale, FL1/21/2022This turned out well for me. As suggested by other reviews, I decreased cooking time and went with my instincts. My store did not have brocolli rabe so I used mustard greens. I used a whole tin of King Oscar anchovies and vegan mozzarella. I would make this again, but it won't become a favourite. GregChicago, IL1/20/2022Not great - flavor fell flat. The parts didn't come together fully to form a complete dish, IMHO. I probably won't make it again, but if I did, I would add more tomato paste, anchovy, and broccoli rabe. AnonymousMinneapolis1/20/2022Not totally sure where all of the critique is coming from in the comments - cooked this last night. Only change I made was 1 extra anchovy and a couple extra cloves of garlic because I can't get enough of either. But no other changes, no other subs needed. Came out like a delicious pan of pizza beans, exactly as advertised. Of course it's going to taste like tomato! It's essentially a pizza without the bread. Cmon yall! Anonymous1/19/2022I upped the garlic in the beginning and added lemon zest at the end. If time permitted, I might saute or roast the beans in olive oil, garlic and salt before adding.  Because we like spice I might use some arrabiata sauce instead of canned tomato the next time. I'd also add some panko on top for crunch at the end. We ate leftovers with a little more sauce on top of pasta. Overall it was a good starting point which is all a recipe generally provides.RonnieWashington, DC1/18/2022I typically am a fan of every BA recipe I try, but this was...not good. I think the rabe spent too much time in the pan and imparted the tomato sauce with its bitterness, rather than the tomato enhancing the rabe, which was what I was hoping for. Five minutes was not nearly long enough for the beans to absorb any flavor or for the texture to improve. If I was to try this again, I would increase the anchovies to 6, use a large can of whole tomatoes (rather than a 14 oz can), put the beans in much sooner, and either leave the rabe until later or omit altogether and sub in spinach. Ali Peterborough, NH1/18/2022While the adjustments to the recipe do sound tasty Spoonmom, the recipe calls for broccoli rabe not broccolini. \nDifferent tastes and cooking times. I really enjoy both :)Anonymous1/18/2022Nope. Not with the recipe as written. I bought the ingredients and made this twice, because I had enough of the 'stuff,' to make a modified version the following weekend. It was SO much better... and quite honestly it could even do better in the summer with fresh garden tomatoes, but, that's not possible now.\n\nSo, take 1 - as written. Too -'canned' tasting, and I believe it was from the condesing and then the additon of paste as well. It's NOT both necessary. Broccolini is one of my favorite veggies, but in this recipe, it gets overcooked and turned to mush. It's a waste. \n\nTake 2 - did not add additional tomato paste. Swapped fresh spinach, cooked down with a little EVOO & garlic 1st, then added to tomatoes, for broccolini. To cook down the anchovies, I added some of the regular tomatoes with garlic etc... to let them cook down into. \n\nI would definitely make this again with my adjustments. Not as written.
