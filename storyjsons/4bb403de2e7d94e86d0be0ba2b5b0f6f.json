What kind of person never grills burgers? Just hear me out.For one, as I wrote a few weeks back, I\u2019m trying to expand my grilling game this summer, firing up everything from Korean-style short ribs to charred cabbage. And over the past several summers, when I do grill burgers, I\u2019ve been making smash burgers, wherein I place a cast-iron skillet on my Weber, and I pretend I\u2019m a short-order cook at Shake Shack. See, just look here\u2014video proof!But every now and then, I really want a classic, charcoal-grilled burger: plump, glistening with fat, kissed with smoke and flame. It tastes just like summer.Want this letter before it hits the website? Sign up for our newsletter!Here\u2019s my technique.Eighty-twenty ground beef is non-negotiable. That is 80 percent meat, 20 percent fat. Anything leaner and it\u2019s going be dense and not nearly as juicy as you want it to be. So when you\u2019re at the grocery store meat counter, steer away from the blend that says 85 or 90 percent lean.Next, grab and handful of ground beef and pack it as loosely as possible, so it\u2019s just holding together. If you want, you can use your thumb to form a dimple on the top side. Our friend Bobby Flay says this prevents it from turning into one of those bulbous burgers your dad used to grill up.Now, lay the patty onto a well-cleaned grill over medium-high heat. Basically, this is as hot as a gas grill will go, or if using charcoal, you want glowing orange coals. A sprinkle of salt on the burger. And then don\u2019t touch it. Just let the fire do its thing, imbuing the patty with flavor and smoke, and imparting a dark brown, crispy sear. Maybe five minutes, depending on how thick it is. Flip it gently, and then add another sprinkle of salt. Top with cheese. I like the gooey glossiness of American, but if you\u2019re the cheddar type, go for it.At this point, once all your patties are cheesed up, put the top on, vents open, and let it go for about a minute until the cheese fully melts. Done. Medium rare. If I\u2019m feeling ambitious, I\u2019ll toast the buns (potato rolls, preferably). Condiments? Not much. Special sauce is never not a good move. Otherwise, I\u2019m okay with straight mayo. I\u2019m not going to argue with a sliced, ripe avocado. Maybe some crisp bibb or butter lettuce. Tomatoes, only if it\u2019s August.The only problem is, one burger is never enough, but two is too much. So make sure you\u2019ve got a partner, and go halfies on the second one. I mean, why not? It\u2019s summer. And, really, how often do you grill burgers?Get the recipe:The BA Burger DeluxeView RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titAdam NewsletterRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
