Duh. The roster of dishes changes based on seasons, sometimes on a whim, but order these if you see them surface on the menu: crispy lotus root with chili oil; creamy corn with taleggio and doenjang; the kimchi and chorizo combo, sometimes stuffed into squid or served with octopus; fried chicken with a surprisingly delicious peanut butter dipping sauce; and the walnut-topped burrata for dessert. The wine list is tight, with a few by-the-glass options, but our favorite non-alcoholic nightcap is the refreshing corn silk tea.THE VIBE IS: kind of cafeteria-like. Spare two-top and four-top tables line the long space, which can come off as cold and industrial, but manager (and Park\u2019s wife) Ellia Park brings in the warmth with friendly, attentive service. Despite looking like it might have terrible acoustics, Atoboy never reaches shout-over-everyone loud, so it\u2019s perfect for dinner with more adventurous parents. Plus, you might see chefs on their days off here\u2014it\u2019s an industry favorite.PRACTICAL STUFF: Open for dinner everyday: Monday to Saturday, from 5:30 to 10 p.m., and Sunday, from 5:30 to 9:30 p.m. Snag reservations via Resy, but it\u2019s easy enough to slip in as a two-top.\u2014Elyse InamineDiane KangWE ALSO LOVEKeens SteakhouseNYC\u2019s classic midtown steakhouse\u2014still perfect after all these yearsEleven Madison ParkFour-star dining redefined from hit makers Daniel Humm and Will GuidaraUncle BoonsBrave the spice at NoLiTa's best dinner-with-friends jointExplore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
