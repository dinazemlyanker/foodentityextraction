(I stand by that.) \u201cIf you\u2019ve already got one, move along!\u201d I added. I believed it\u2014and for many cooks one cast-iron workhorse will do. But ever since I wrote that article, fancy cast-iron pans have been following me around, popping up in targeted ads and earnest conversations from fellow cooks. Happily, finally, I caved to temptation; I tried the sleek Vermicular Frying Pan.Vermicular Frying Pan$155 at Vermicular$155 at Food52The Vermicular Frying Pan claims to do everything you\u2019d expect from a classic cast-iron skillet, like this dependable Lodge that often goes on sale for $18. Meaning, you can expect the pan to be durable, even-heating, and ideal for high-heat cooking. But beyond that, Vermicular says its frying pan will \u201crecalibrate your expectations of cast-iron cooking\u201d with its \u201cfeatherweight design\u201d and \u201cheavyweight performance.\u201d Unlike traditional cast-iron pans, the Vermicular also sports a nonstick enamel coating and claims to offer the best of both worlds\u2014the slickness of the best nonstick pans coupled with the high-heat capacity of cast iron. I loved the idea of a pan that didn\u2019t require two hands to go from stovetop to table. But I worried that without the heft, the Vermicular pan would cool down quickly when it came into contact with a big cut of meat and wondered if the pan could really be as low-maintenance as advertised. Plus, this pan is $155, with a corresponding glass lid for $40\u2014would it be worth it?To test those factors I used my Vermicular in place of my fallback Lodge for everything for three months. (Well, almost everything\u2014more on its limitations later.) I browned mushrooms and wilted bok choy, seared this looks-fancy-actually-breezy one skillet steak, fried shallots, and steamed plump clams using that $40 lid. I also cooked a few things I would normally only trust on the glossy surface of a nonstick skillet: this weeknight crispy tofu, for example, and scrambled eggs.After a couple of months of frying and searing, I can say that the Vermicular pan is lightweight and heats evenly and quickly, just as advertised. If you\u2019re after a pan that will live permanently on your stovetop, this is the one. Its design is eye-catching enough you\u2019ll never want to put it away anyway; while much cast-iron cookware is rustic and homey, the Frying Pan is more modern than it is prairie-ish. You\u2019ll sear meat and fish, stir-fry vegetables, crisp tofu, toast nuts, and caramelize onions in here happily, thanks to the ripping hot surface and quick moisture evaporation. The nonstick enamel coating will stay in fairly good shape with little upkeep, making it ideal for anyone intimidated by the rigors of cast-iron care. It\u2019s a gorgeous piece of cookware that offers precision where a traditional cast iron just provides a whopping dose of heat.Still, the wooden handle, while ergonomically designed and lightweight, is not oven-safe and cuts the pan\u2019s use in half. For that reason alone, the Vermicular Frying Pan is best for someone who already has a traditional cast-iron skillet for all their skillet cookies and roast chickens.Score: 9/10ProsLightweight and even-heatingNearly nonstickEasier to care for than traditional cast ironConsSteep priceHandle is not oven-safeThe basicsThe Vermicular frying pan comes in two sizes: a 9.4\", which has a 2\" depth for easy frying, and a 10.2\", with a depth of 1.6\". The 9.4\", which I tried out, clocks in at just 2.3 lb. By comparison, a 9\" Lodge cast-iron skillet weighs 4.17 lb. The base of the pan itself is as thin as a nonstick skillet and has a slick enamel coating, which essentially means that the pan is even better at evaporating liquid than a standard cast iron, leading to faster and more even frying, searing, and caramelizing. Think of the enamel coating on your Dutch oven: This is a thinner layer of that. It\u2019s not quite as scratchproof as the thick, glossy coating on a Le Creuset; it\u2019s but a step up from standard, naturally porous \u201craw\u201d cast iron.The other main difference is that the handle is made of wood. That gorgeous oak or walnut feels great in your hand and lends to the pan\u2019s lightness but isn\u2019t oven-safe. (The company plans to release a pan with a metal handle this fall.)What does the Vermicular frying pan do well?All those little tweaks in a classic design result in a pan that is superior in many ways to your everyday cast-iron skillet. For one\u2014and this is a big one for many home cooks\u2014the Vermicular\u2019s lightweight design makes it approachable to cooks with limited mobility or strength. I found that I could pick up the pan easily with one hand and take it to the table, whereas I\u2019d prefer two with my Lodge. The wooden handle, which overall is a negative, is ergonomically designed.It also doesn\u2019t need to be seasoned because of the enamel coating. My beloved Tawashi scrubber and archaic-looking Ringer chain mail, both key for scrubbing away little crusty bits on an old school cast-iron skillet, have sat untouched. I mostly just wiped the Vermicular out with a warm damp cloth and then quickly and thoroughly dried it, occasionally using a bit of soap on a soft sponge\u2014but that\u2019s it. The pan has stayed free of rust or scabby bits even with use three or four nights a week for months.Because of that enamel, liquids evaporate more quickly than with traditional cast-iron pans. The team at Vermicular says that it takes three seconds for a teaspoon of water to vanish in their pan. When BA tested evaporation time in a traditional cast iron skillet, it took around 30 seconds. What does this mean, practically speaking, for you? Superior caramelization and intensified flavors. In order for the Maillard reaction to occur (when the proteins and sugars in your food transform into the caramelized, savory brown crust we love) you need heat and a dearth of water. That\u2019s why we suggest patting dry a steak before you sear it or making sure you give chunks of beef or lamb for stew plenty of room when you brown them\u2014if the pan is crowded, your meat will just steam in the liquid it gives off instead of searing. The enamel coating on the Vermicular pan essentially nudges you along toward the Maillard reaction, even in the case of veggies that have a tendency to wilt and steam.The third benefit of the enamel coating is its glossiness. I love this pan for crisping the skin on a duck breast, which has a high enough fat content to easily separate from the pan once caramelized. But I find the biggest difference is with vegetables and other foods with a low fat content, like slices of tofu. The base of a standard cast iron pan can easily become nubbly and rough, meaning delicate and lean foods often need plenty of oil in order to release naturally from the pan in an even, golden layer. This pan\u2019s coating stayed slick enough to sear slices of tofu, delicate greens, and in a pinch, even scramble eggs without a pool of butter. (I\u2019d still go for a standard nonstick pan for a scramble, but as long as I had wiped a thin bit of oil around the pan carefully and didn\u2019t agitate the eggs wildly while scrambling, they didn\u2019t stick.)The enamel coating also means you can cook acidic food like tomatoes in it. (While a well-cared for and evenly seasoned regular cast iron can handle acidic foods just fine, a neglected one will impart metallic taste to long-simmered acidic foods, like a tomato sauce.) I slowly reheated a batch of rasam in there and found that the pan left no metallic bite in the tomato broth.About that beautiful wooden handle\u2026The one big bummer? That unique wood handle. Dutch babies won\u2019t work. Browning chicken thighs and then nestling them into a bed of vegetables to finish cooking in the oven, also out. Using my pan for a pull apart bread or this skillet phyllo pie? Big nope. I seared a rib eye in the pan, and while the results were just as evenly brown as if I\u2019d cooked it in a heavier skillet, I then had to switch pans to finish it in the oven. For that reason alone the Vermicular pan can\u2019t really replace your existing cast iron\u2014but for stovetop use, I prefer it, and it can maybe even replace your nonstick skillet.Lodge Pre-Seasoned Cast-Iron Skillet$34 $18 at AmazonIf you do not yet have a cast iron, I\u2019d still say go for a classic, delightfully inexpensive Lodge. But If you\u2019re looking to expand your cast-iron collection, and you\u2019re ready for a well-designed, stovetop-only pan, the Vermicular is worth the price. Then put it to use with both the delicate proteins, vegetables, and all the saucy, oil-coated things you normally cook in your OG cast iron. For now, I\u2019d rate the Vermicular Frying Pan, which has barely left my burner, a 9/10. And when that metal-handled pan comes out, I\u2019d easily give this beauty a 10/10.Explore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
