Let sit at least 10 minutes and up to 2 hours.Step 3Heat 1 Tbsp. vegetable oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high.

Toss pork, breaking up with tongs or a wooden spoon, and continue to cook, tossing, until cooked through, about 1 minute more. Transfer to a plate. Repeat with another 1 Tbsp. vegetable oil and remaining pork (you may want to briefly remove skillet from heat when adding more oil so it doesn\u2019t spatter). Wipe out skillet.Step 4Heat remaining 1 Tbsp. vegetable oil in skillet over medium-high. Add carrots and cook in a single layer, undisturbed, until beginning to soften and brown underneath, about 2 minutes. Add collard greens and toss to wilt.

Top each with some scallions and a spoonful of gochujang; drizzle with dressing.How would you rate Spicy Pork Bowl With Greens and Carrots?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (26)Back to TopTriangleSo tasty and easy. Will definitely be making this again. I used a cast iron skillet and had no issues with the carrots burning.AnonymousSan Francisco, CA1/29/2022This was very good and I will definitely make it again. The pork was so tender and very flavorful. I was worried about adding three tablespoons of chili paste so I used two. Sorry I did as it was not spicy at all. Next time I will use three. I cooked the carrots first and removed them from the pan and then cooked the kale. It was good that I did as the kale needs to be cooked longer and the carrots would have burned to a crisp. Just remove them from the pan and keep them covered so they stay hot. The dressing is really good and I will double the amount like some other reviewers said. BabyRose Centereach, N.Y.1/20/2022love the recipes, please try to get them on 1 page for printing~\nkathrynnew bern nc12/9/2021This fantastic recipe was a big hit in our family. I\u2019ll definitely add it to my regular repertoire!Sarah GVermont2/19/2021If I wasn't working from home, I'm not sure I'd call this a weeknight meal, what with the 45 minutes of freezing and 2 hours of marinating, however it was DELICIOUS! I would make double the veg next time. :) I did not top with gochujang or sriracha - just used the sambal oelek in the marinate and I thought the flavor and spice was perfect! As a point of contrast from another reviewer, I really liked the collards in this - I thought the slight bitterness was a good contrast to the spice. Try it, you'll like it. AnneSacramento, CA1/5/2021This was such a great weeknight meal! I used rainbow chard instead of collard greens and it turned out great. I chopped the stems of the chard and saut\u00e9ed them with the carrots. Definitely is spicy , so next time I think I\u2019ll tone down to 2 tablespoons of chili sauce instead. Will for sure make again! It\u2019s such a perfect and unique use of pork tenderloin and came out much more tender than I expected Emily JDenver, CO12/21/2020This was so good and easy! I used Siracha for the hot chili paste and marinated the pork according to the recipe and some tofu for the vegetarian in the family. My daughter literally ate the entire block of tofu. Everyone loved it. I bought some greens for this but ended up throwing whatever veggies I had in the fridge in with it and all came out great. We will make this again.  Audrey in ManchesterManchester, England, United Kingdom6/4/2020Just made this for dinner and LOVED it. I had to use spinach but no problem there. The pork tasted great, love the spiciness. Definitely worth adding the extra gochujang on the side. Will make again. adamleclairOsaka, Japan5/14/2020Delicious and fairly quick weeknight meal, can easily adjust the level of spice depending on preferences. Perfect for a weeknight family meal or lunch prep! AnonymousOntario, Canada4/1/2020Wow, this was delicious. The sauce totally makes it!! When you're cooking the carrots, don't leave them in the pan for too long before adding the kale - the kale takes a while to wilt so your carrots might end up a little burnt.AnonymousNYC3/20/2020Wow, this is HOT. I toned it back to 2 tablespoons of sambal, and added more ginger & a little extra sugar. Excellent flavor. Will make it again.AnonymousVail, CO1/6/2020I love this recipe. I made it as is the first time. Since then I make extra marinade and set about 2tbsp aside and mix with rice vinegar to brighten it up and then drizzle on top. I use kale and a smaller amount of book Choi. AnonymousCHICAGO 12/22/2019SO good. Made exactly as stated here with a little extra ging and garlic. Also doubled the marinade to drizzle over the top (careful, it's spicy - pare down the sambal oelek if you're sensitive to heat), which just made it extra delicious. If you don't eat pork, I think this would be just as good with chicken, steak, or even seared tofu. Awesome recipe! AnonymousNew Jersey10/25/2019Collard greens are NOT great here. I would make this again but \ud83d\udcaf use ANY other green veggie. No way my child is eating this. Lol.  Spicy pork is yummy (I went with only 2T of Sambal oelek and it is quite spicy) alohalifeNew Braunfels, TX10/17/2019As someone cooking for one, this made a great Sunday night dinner. And I just packed lunches for the next few days too. In the future, I'll double the marinade, reserving half of it for serving on top.Anonymous6/24/2019Explore Bon App\u00e9titRice and Grain BowlKoreanEast AsianAsianPork TenderloinPorkMeatCarrotVegetableEasyWeeknight MealsOne-Pot MealsMainDairy-FreeHealthyishSaut\u00e9DinnerRecipes you want to make.
