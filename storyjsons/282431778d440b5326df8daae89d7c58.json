The only thing that bugged me, and admittedly is something I should have considered, is that a lot of my broth steamed off while it was warming (over very low heat) so I didn't have the final cup in the last step (subbed in water w/ some melted butter and a splash of wine-- worked fine). Definitely will make this one again, but maybe add a little drizzle of broccoli rabe pesto or something JenNY NY1/23/2022Very tasty! I didn't have tomato paste so i used 2/3 tablespoons of tomato passata after cooking the onion and garlic (and let it reduce before adding the rice). I also added a rosemary twig at this point, which I removed later. Worked great!L\u00edvia BadianiBrazil10/31/2021Not at all what was expected. Light, delicate, not tomatoy, just surprised pop of fresh tomato flavor when little tomato hidden in the bite of rice.\nRisotto sometimes sounds too hot on a hot summer day but this was refreshing instead AnonymousTexas9/15/2021This was great. Easy but full of flavour. The cheese seems to be key to getting such creaminess.JulianSydney, Australia6/27/2021This was really delicious - I ate half of it standing at my kitchen counter. I followed the recipe, omitting the nutmeg. I ordered more tomatoes so I can make this again next week. Topped with shaved parm, pepper, and flaky Maldon.Pony RemarkPennsylvania 3/8/2021Loved it. The sweetness of the tomatoes is ridiculously delicious with the savoriness of the parmigiana. Eileen WOklahoma1/23/2021Typically Italian; simple ingredients combined for an explosion of flavor.  Love that it is a recipe that can be made without a trip to the store.AnonymousCalifornia 9/28/2020A-M-A-Z-I-N-G recipe! I made a chicken stock on the side by just boiling then simmering a chicken leg with water, onion, garlic and herbs for three-four hours and topped risotto with a balsamic drizzle and seared scallops.sdemeloCanada5/29/2020Delicious, and full of flavor. I added a little bit of ancho chili powder and ground cayenne and it added just the tiniest kick. It\u2019s parmy,acidic,salty and rich. Nick KressCincinnati, Ohio5/29/2020Umm this recipe is not complete. There is nothing in the ingredients list that tells you how much garlic to add. So how much did you add?AnonymousTexas5/17/2020Delicious!!!! As time consuming risotto is, this full-flavoured hearty dish is worth it. AnonymousBrisbane, Australia1/23/2020This recipe is incredible!! I'm sooo impatient and didn't realize how long risotto takes. Totally worth it. Wish the recipe yielded more so I could eat it all week long, but my husband gobbled it all up in two meals. AnonymousLos Angeles10/1/2019Delicious! Just as I was wondering why I hadn't seen a tomato risotto, Andy saved the day. Risotto can usually be quite neutral but this one is loaded with flavor. It's a shame I've only made it for myself AnonymousHouston8/25/2019Bellissima! Used Swiss Bouillon for the broth instead of chicken (lazy + veg) - took slightly longer to reduce but otherwise as per recipe above. A go-to risotto. macaulaysulkinSheffield, UK8/21/2019Super super good, but needed tons of lemons for brightness.8/19/2019Explore Bon App\u00e9titRisottoItalianEuropeanCherry TomatoTomatoVegetableParmesanCheeseRiceRice & GrainsSummerEasyWeeknight MealsMainGluten-FreeNut-FreeLunchDinnerRecipes you want to make.
