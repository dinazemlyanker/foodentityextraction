Pro tip: If you sign up for the newsletter, you'll get the scoop before everyone else.Healthyish friends,If you read no further, read this: We\u2019d love to know what you thought of this year\u2019s Feel Good Food Plan. Even if you cooked only a few (or none!) of the recipes, take two minutes and fill out this little survey. It\u2019ll help us make the plan even better and more delicious next year. We appreciate you!I\u2019m on a reporting trip in the California desert this week, and it\u2019s been nice to see so much sky and hear so much silence. Since the Feel Good Food Plan wrapped and last week\u2019s Healthyish 22 launch, I\u2019ve been trying to slow down a bit. I\u2019m one of those people who can turn even leisure-time into a stressful activity, so actually doing this requires care and attention. Though it definitely helps when the temps are in the teens and below.This past frigid weekend involved some low-key cooking, including Chris Morocco\u2019s coconut-braised chicken, which is genius because it can be assembled in literally a minute, so the one-ish hour it spends in the oven feels like time well spent. I\u2019d say you could add extra coconut milk at the beginning if you want it extra saucy, or use the last of the can to make coconut rice (like I did). It was one of the best meals I\u2019ve made in a long time. Then my living companion got it into his head to make bread, and rather than taunt him for becoming a #breadbro I decided that if someone in my house wants to make delicious, warm, homemade gluten, I\u2019d best keep my mouth shut. The bread was heavenly, then two days later he acquired a sourdough starter, so, yeah, we\u2019re those people now.Watching the Netflix Fyre Festival documentary was definitely not a relaxing use of leisure time, and judging by my Instagram DMs, you felt the same. People like Billy McFarland are terrifying, but what I find scarier is the fact that no one around him tried to stop his sociopathic descent that pulled so many others down too. Do we never learn?! I hated pretty much everyone in that documentary except for the residents of the island who got screwed. (And I\u2019m glad that decent people raised enough money to pay back the Bahamian restaurant owner, but we obviously owe a lot more people a lot more than that.) I had intentions to watch the Hulu doc too, but I think I\u2019ll just listen to Springsteen instead.In other grifter news, I\u2019d been following this Caroline Calloway Twitter thread ever since associate editor Hilary Cadigan clued me in, and I loved seeing how it all unfolded. This time, I'm happy to report, everyone seems to have gotten out unscathed. Thank God, because I don\u2019t think I could handle another #Fyregate right now.If you need me, I\u2019ll be in the desert.Sincerely,Amanda ShapiroHealthyish editorExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishHealthyish NewsletteressayRead MoreLifestyleThese People Are Changing the Way We Live on This Crazy PlanetBy Amanda ShapiroRecipes you want to make.
