Not anymore!By Ali FrancisMarch 4, 2022FacebookTwitterEmailIllustration by Hazel ZavalaFacebookTwitterEmailFor a long time I felt the same way about making cocktails as I did about learning to code. And that is to say: not for me. It\u2019s not that I didn\u2019t think either were solid life choices\u2014one will make you popular and the other will make you rich\u2014it\u2019s just that I honestly couldn\u2019t tell you what Chartreuse is any more than I could JavaScript. (Some kind of ancient scroll?) I am almost 31 years old, with no basic cocktail knowledge, and it felt too late to start learning now. This haggard old sponge simply can\u2019t be expected to absorb everything.Last year all that changed. My boyfriend, who loves a craft cocktail, and I went on a road trip for the better part of 2021. Our \u201cthing\u201d was going for a drink at whichever local watering hole we were closest to. I\u2019d stare blankly at the menu while he confidently zeroed in on his perfect order\u2014usually something with lemon and cognac, whatever that is. I would struggle through my ill-ordered cocktail like it was a poisoned chalice, a bystander to my BF\u2019s blissful sipping. Until one night it struck me that\u2014as someone who recently learned to snowboard, regularly surfs big waves, and once stood on the spikes of a deadly fish and lived to tell the tale\u2014the only thing holding me back from booze actualization was my own insecurity.Soon after our trip I found my cocktail teacher in the form of an app: Imbiblia, which was designed for bartenders, restaurants, and drink nerds but features a very simple, beginner-friendly user interface and 450 recipes for cocktails and ingredients like syrup. Like the digital version of your mom\u2019s old recipe folder, the \u201clibrary\u201d features an alphabetical list of cocktails. When you click into one, the page displays the ingredients and quantities, along with a series of cute illustrations that quickly suggest whether your drink should be shaken or stirred, served over ice or neat, in a martini glass or highball, and a few garnish options. A little info section also outlines the history of each drink, and a batch calculator helps you scale up the recipes for a crowd. I had to go and look up some cocktail jargon (double-strain?), but Imbiblia definitely teaches a man to fish.After cringing through And Just Like That\u2026\u2014which a colleague aptly said she \u201caffectionately hated\u201d\u2014I binged all of Sex and the City. Hence came the inspo for my first experiment: cosmopolitans. Once I\u2019d mastered Imbiblia\u2019s recipe, I tried swapping out vodka (a spirit I\u2019m going to leave in my university days) for a floral gin, and cranberry for pomegranate juice (much better!). I learned that I loved the citrusy Cointreau, despite blacking out on the dance floor after doing four shots straight in school and never touching it since. So I tried a White Lady next: two parts gin to equal parts lemon juice and Cointreau, shaken with ice, double-strained, and served neat in a coupe. Super easy to make but chic-looking enough to feel accomplished doing it. When I wasn\u2019t sure what I felt like next, I chose the cocktails with cute names: Swizzle! Fizz! And the Bicicletta, a spritz that is also the Italian word for bicycle. Sip by sip, I learned.Imbiblia\u2019s Canada-based developer, Jean-Marc Dykes, designed the app during his own existential crisis: After more than a decade working behind bar counters, he was laid off from his job in March 2020. So he moved into a souped-up van, borrowed friends\u2019 wifi, and decided to teach himself to code by working on the project he\u2019d always dreamed of.\u201cI got the idea for it years before the pandemic,\u201d Dykes tells me over the phone. \u201cI was behind the bar and dealing with that sticky [cocktail recipe] binder\u2014peeling two pages apart from one another just to check one tiny little ingredient\u2014and I remember thinking that there's got to be a better way than this monstrosity.\u201d After building the app over nine months, he launched the first version of Imbiblia on the iOS App Store last August, and then on the Google Play Store in September. (In both places it costs a one-time fee of $2.99 to download.) It\u2019s been ranked the number one food and beverage app by Apple a couple of times since launch and has been downloaded over a thousand times by cocktail enthusiasts of all types.After a long day snowboarding recently, my boyfriend and I went out for apr\u00e8s. I confidently ordered a sour, made with local honey rye whiskey, apricot puree, and maple syrup. As we sat by the fire reminiscing about our runs, I remembered why I wanted to learn about cocktails in the first place\u2014not to flex my knowledge or make sure I remain employed at this food magazine, but to bask in shared bliss with the people I love. Those sunset-hued Cosmos? Adorable! The fruity-sweet White Lady? Soooo fun. The syrupy sour? A bright spot on a cold day. In an era of almost constant FOMO, nailing your cocktail order in good company is a small pleasure.Explore Bon App\u00e9titCultureLifestyleRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
