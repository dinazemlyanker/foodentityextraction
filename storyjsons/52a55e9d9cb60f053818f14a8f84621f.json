Pastry cream is made by cooking eggs, dairy, sugar, and a thickener. To avoid scrambling the eggs, many recipes employ a technique called tempering, in which you add a bit of hot dairy to the eggs to gradually bring up the temperature. For this tart recipe, we wanted to know what would happen if we nixed tempering (and the extra bowl and ladle) and instead slowly brought up all the ingredients together. The result: a smooth pastry cream with a bit less fuss\u2014and a lot less mess.Ingredients8 servings Unsalted butter, room temperature (for pan)\u00becup plus 2 Tbsp. sugar; plus more for pan8large egg yolks2large eggs\u2154cup cornstarch\u00bdtsp. kosher salt3cups whole milk1\u00bdcups chilled heavy cream, divided1vanilla bean, split lengthwise, or 1\u00bd tsp. vanilla extract or paste1lb. stone fruit, cut into wedges, blueberries and/or blackberriesPreparationStep 1Butter a 9\"-diameter cake pan. Line bottom with a round of parchment paper; smooth out. Coat sides with sugar, tapping out excess. Gently whisk egg yolks, eggs, cornstarch, salt, and \u00be cup sugar in a large saucepan until smooth, then whisk vigorously until lightened in color, 1\u20132 minutes. Whisking constantly, gradually stream in milk, followed by 1 cup cream; scrape sides of pan. Scrape in vanilla seeds; discard pod. Cook mixture over medium heat, whisking constantly, until it starts to thicken, then whisk vigorously until it holds marks of whisk, 6\u201310 minutes. Immediately remove custard from heat (do not let boil); let cool slightly.Step 2Using a rubber spatula, press custard through a fine-mesh sieve into prepared pan. Chill, uncovered, 20 minutes (it should be warm but not hot). Place a rack in middle of oven and preheat to 400\u00b0.Step 3Bake custard until top is deeply browned in spots, 40\u201350 minutes (it will still be wobbly in the center). Let cool.Step 4Toss fruit with remaining 2 Tbsp. sugar in a medium bowl. Let sit 15 minutes.Step 5Slide a knife around sides of custard to loosen and place a plate upside down over custard; invert onto plate. Peel away parchment and invert again onto another plate. Whisk remaining \u00bd cup cream in a medium bowl until soft peaks form. Serve slices of custard topped with fruit and whipped cream.Step 6Do Ahead: Custard can be baked 1 day ahead. Cover and chill.How would you rate Custard Tart with Cream and Fresh Fruit?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (3)Back to TopTriangleI liked this recipe a lot! I\u2019m not much of a baker at all so I enjoyed taking this one on as a challenge. Lots of whisking as the other commenter said but it was doable for me without an electric mixer. My tart did not come out nearly as beautiful as the one in the photo \u2014 mine was much paler (I left it in the oven longer to see if it would darken, with no luck) and not glossy at all. I ended up styling the fruit on top of the whole tart to disguise it. But it tastes great and custardy. I would make this again!GracegraceNew York9/8/2018In answer to the previous question - no, you're not crazy! - it looks like a crust.  But, I made this and found that it just bakes that way.  I followed the recipe and it also appeared to have a crust.  \nI don't think I'll try this again.  It was ok but more trouble than it was worth.  It involves a LOT of whisking; more than I could do.  I used my hand mixer for the last 5 minutes or so.  That may have made it denser than it should have been.  I found it took some work to push it through the sieve. The flavor was good, but I was hoping for something a little more custard-y.\nAnonymousBainbridge Island9/6/2018The photos in the printed Sept issue of BA this definitely looks like it has a crust... as do these photos.
