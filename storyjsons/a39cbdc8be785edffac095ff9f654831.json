They\u2019re not bad, they\u2019re just not memorable. Which is why this year, we\u2019re all about Fruition, whose Easter eggs and chocolate berries are standout treats that capture spring in a way that day-old, clearance rack milk chocolate never will.Hat tip to senior food editor Chris Morocco for recommending the Catskills, New York-based chocolatier; he loves their dark milk chocolate, even though he doesn\u2019t even like milk chocolate. Fruition\u2019s Easter eggs ($12) elevate traditional peanut butter- or ganache-filled chocolate eggs to a whole new level. The packaging resembles four quail eggs in a nest\u2014the two blue ones have a creamy center with peanut butter and crunchy toffee, while the pink strawberry basil ones have a slightly savory white chocolate filling. The eggs aren\u2019t big\u2014you can eat one in two bites\u2014and (spoiler alert) each egg has a flat chocolate surface, so really, you\u2019re getting four halved eggs. A trompe l\u2019\u0153il, if you will.Not your average chocolate egg.\nIn terms of chocolate pairings, the eggs taste well alongside the chocolate tumbled raspberries ($15). They don\u2019t scream Easter as much as the eggs, but that\u2019s what makes them a good gift all season long (hi, Mother\u2019s Day). Each jar contains a shareable amount of chocolate gum drops-meet-powdered truffles filled with freeze-dried raspberries. They have a pure cocoa aroma and though the outer surface is powdery, you\u2019ll taste the smooth white chocolate inner coating before you get to the raspberry filling. They simultaneously melt and crumble in your mouth and aren\u2019t at all gooey. Like the Easter eggs, the chocolate raspberries combine rich dark chocolate with sweet and fruity touches in a parade of flavor.All of Fruition\u2019s \u201cbean to bar\u201d chocolates are handcrafted from fair trade and organically grown cacao beans. There\u2019s a solid selection of 60-gram bars like the 68% dark milk chocolate one that Morocco loves, and the insanely rich 100% dark chocolate. And if you can\u2019t resist a chocolate bunny, fear not\u2014Fruition makes a classic hollow one for all those Easter baskets.Buy Fruition chocolate on its website or bars on Amazon. The last we checked, the eggs were sold out on Fruition\u2019s site, but we found them at Zingerman\u2019s for $20.A different kind of egg:Explore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingChocolateEasterRead MoreshoppingCompart\u00e9s Chocolate Bars Are the Gift I'm Giving Everyone This YearBy Amanda ShapirofeaturesTrader Joe\u2019s Newest Products in 2018, ReviewedBy Alex BeggsRecipes you want to make.
