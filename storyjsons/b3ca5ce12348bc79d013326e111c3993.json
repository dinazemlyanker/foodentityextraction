But now, in my tiny corner of the world, English muffins are undergoing a miniature revival. And no offense to a particularly popular variety named after a certain Mr. Samuel Thomas, but I\u2019m not talking about the flimsy two-biters of my youth. No, I\u2019m talking about English muffins with more heft and flavor. Of all of the ones I love\u2014homemade with sourdough discard (you have my permission to roll your eyes), snagged from Motzi Bread in Baltimore, or found in the freezer section of my grocery store\u2014my very favorite is the sourdough English muffins from Dam Good English Muffins in Cortlandt, New York.Ever since my friend Ali introduced them to me, I\u2019ve been ordering packs online and stowing them in the freezer for whenever I need a pick-me-up. What I love about these muffins is that they\u2019re tangy thanks to the natural yeasts in the sourdough starter and the cold fermentation; they\u2019re chewy; they\u2019re salty; and they\u2019re LARGE. These are the kind of English muffins that can stand up to a fully loaded breakfast sandwich. They\u2019re sturdy enough to handle a poached egg, a muffin-size pizza, or a heavy-on-the-PB&J sandwich. (They\u2019re also vegan, a trait I nullify as soon as I generously slather them with butter, hot from the toaster.)I recommend ordering at least three bags to start. That way, you won\u2019t be quite as perturbed when your roommate/partner/mom asks you to share. Not that that\u2019s ever happened to me or anything\u2026Photo by Emma FishmanDam Good English Muffins$6 at Dam Good English Muffins$18 at Etsy \u2013 Three BagsExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendShoppingRecipes you want to make.
