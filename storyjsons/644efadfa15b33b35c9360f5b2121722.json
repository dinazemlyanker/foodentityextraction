I've made this twice and I'll be making it again, just with some modifications to my taste: omitted the lemon peels and squeezed fresh lemon juice over the entire dish at the end (the peels imparted a bitterness I didn't like, whereas the juice adds fresh acidity); doubled the garlic; and added freshly ground black pepper and chopped roasted cashews at the end. No need for flaky sea salt thanks to salinity from the olives and feta. A tip for crushing and de-pitting Castelvetrano olives: use a pestle, it's less messy (and painful lol) than using your hand.MollyPortland, OR12/22/2021This is such an easy and delicious appetizer! A friend made it last night and added a small spoon to the serving dish and our guests scooped it on crostini\u2019s. I\u2019m making it again today! Carrie McCarthyLA, CA9/18/2021Absolutely delicious and super easy.  Watching the video was really helpful for the flow of how to do work smoothly.  I like the layout of the video.Patricia MillsBrooklyn, NY6/1/2021I made the recipe once and loved it.  \nI am wondering if I can make this a day a head.  What do you all think?Natalie LAnn Arbor, MI4/21/2021Those olives appear to be pitted.AnonymousLouisville, KY2/8/2021This looks delicious and I'm looking forward to making it. It would be helpful if the hands in the videos would actually demonstrate the proper way to serve one's self this app. Do you use a toothpick to snag an olive and a chunk of feta? Obviously you would want to soak the bread with some of the yummy oil but do you try to scoop an olive up with a piece of the bread? How do you do that without everyone getting their fingers in the oil? Just wondering...........\nDianeMurrells Inlet, South Carolina2/1/2021Love this recipe, made it many times.  I may try heating the ingredients in a microwave, want to see if that would work if I brought everything to a guests home. SteveCorona Del Mar, CA11/29/2020fantastic app for castelvetrano olives which we\nabsolutely love.  please share the brand of olives that you especially like; they vary a lot!\nthanks for the great recipe!\n\ud83d\ude2c\n\nsassygirl711chicago5/28/2020Wow...love this and the story that went with it. I am always needing something quick to bring to Gatherings....since I work as a teacher of students with visual impairments. I don't arrive home at 5..so this is a perfect recipe. Thank you. Love your site. MASTexasTexas 3/28/2020I have served this quick and delicious appetizer 3 times and my friends have asked for the recipe every time.AnonymousSan Francisco3/17/2020How often can I say \"Yummy!!!\" in one post?  I love this stuff!  My husband isn't a big fan of feta, so I often make it with buffalo mozzarella.  It's great, too!r2swangerTennessee12/27/2019I love this recipe - fast, easy, and delicious.  You missed the boat on your 32 Hanukkah Recipes by not including this.  It's perfect for Hanukkah - lots and lots of olive oil.  It's a shoo-in.Pesha27Philadelphia12/23/2019 Anonymous12/10/2019This takes so little time to prepare and wins rave reviews every time I serve it! I've learned to double it because the recipe as written never goes far enough. I use Castelvetrano olives. I cook them with the pits intact but remove them after the olives cool to avoid jeopardizing my guests' teeth. After three repetitions making this recipe, I decided to count the olives so I know how many pits I should have! I do let the mixture cool before pouring it ver the feta. I've had no issue with the appearance (i.e. the user who reference 'oily curdled milk'). I will make this over and over!\nJean HerremanHilton Head, South Carolina5/30/2019Pouring hot oil all over the cheese makes for a presentation that looks like oily curdled milk.
