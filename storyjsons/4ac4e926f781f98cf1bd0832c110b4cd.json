The Count of Monte Cristo. Frank Sinatra\u2019s \u201cFly Me to The Moon.\u201d And now, this article on curried peanut dip.Okay, let me back it up for a second. This article isn\u2019t technically ghostwritten, it\u2019s just that this ode to Molly Baz\u2019s curried peanut dip is technically from my boyfriend. Don\u2019t get me wrong: I love this dip. I will make it in the Test Kitchen when we\u2019ve got odds and ends lying around that are begging for a protein-packed sauce to turn them into capital \"L\" Lunch, or when friends decide to come over on Friday night after work. But my boyfriend makes it so much I\u2019ve actually had to start sending him other recipes at the beginning of the week, fearful he\u2019s going to max out on peanut butter at any given moment.I get his obsession: It\u2019s only eight ingredients including vegetable oil and salt. Jarred red curry paste and fish sauce give it a quick hit of spice and funk; peanut butter and coconut milk add richness, body, and protein; honey brings the sweetness; and rice vinegar lends a splash of brightness.And talk about something that comes together quickly. After red curry paste is bloomed in a little oil until fragrant, you\u2019ll whisk in coconut milk and bring the whole thing to a simmer. Stir in the rest of the ingredients off heat, then put it in the fridge to set up and cool off, and you\u2019re done. The sauce works drizzled over ground chicken lettuce wraps, as a dip for Persian cucumbers, or thinned out to make a peanutty dressing for salad or rice noodles. The spicy-funky-salty-sweet balance keeps you coming back for more.Don\u2019t ever tell him I think he\u2019s right but maybe my boyfriend is actually onto something here: Curried peanut dip literally goes with everything.Get the recipe:Curried Peanut DipThis creamy, spicy-sweet dip pairs with leftover rotisserie chicken, jammy eggs, cucumber spears, and roasted sweet potatoes for the perfect desk-friendly lunch.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titNever FailDipLunchRecipes you want to make.
