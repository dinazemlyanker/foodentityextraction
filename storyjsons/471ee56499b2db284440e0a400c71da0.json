The hour in which we were allowed to break the 72-hour fast coincided with a slow hike we were taking up Mount Tamalpais, a mountain in Northern California that, as Jack Kerouac rhapsodized, was \u201cas beautiful a mountain as you\u2019ll see anywhere in the world.\u201d Hubby thought we\u2019d enjoy Mother Nature more if we were calorie-deprived...something about heightened senses. But in an attempt to dodge my hangry wrath, he brought two California peaches with which to break our fast. That peach was the singular most flavorful and delicious thing I\u2019d ever eaten, so juicy that the fuzzy membrane, once broken, couldn\u2019t hold its sweet nectar. It ranks as one of my best food memories to this day.Now I live in the Northeast, where soft, ripe, and juicy peaches are nearly impossible to find and super expensive when you do. They don\u2019t even seem related to those prized versions from Georgia or the Golden State. So what\u2019s a peach-loving girl to do when these crimson and gold-hued lovelies call from the produce aisle and the farmers market?Bake with them.I\u2019ve searched the archives looking for a recipe to share, and they all look so good! While one recipe might promise a sweeter filling, another offers a crunchier crisp. After some deliberating, I settled on pitmaster Bryan Furman\u2019s Cinnamon-Oat Peach Crisp. It filled the house with the irresistible aromas of sugar, butter, and cinnamon, and it garnered raves, especially from the bakers in the family. Some commenters claim that the recipe calls for a tad too much sugar. If I were a betting person, I\u2019d say those cooks were from the West Coast or the South, where the fruit is so sweet, it hardly needs any sugar to shine.With the last of the summer peaches (or the stone fruit of your choosing) at the ready, you\u2019ve definitely got time for this.Cinnamon-Oat Peach CrispThis dead-simple oat topping can be repurposed for ANY fruit.
