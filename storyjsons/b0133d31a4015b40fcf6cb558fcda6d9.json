Next up is Tricia Hersey, a performance artist, poet and founder of the Nap Ministry, an interactive project focused on rest as resistance.Anne Helen Petersen\u2019s Buzzfeed essay, \u201cHow Millennials Became the Burnout Generation,\u201d published earlier this year, has spurred a national conversation about burnout culture. But as many pieces written in response to Petersen\u2019s essay point out, the experience she describes isn\u2019t universal. Burnout culture disproportionately harms people of color, especially Black Americans.Tricia Hersey is the founder of the Nap Ministry, an organization that advocates for rest as a form of resistance against burnout culture and capitalism more broadly. Black Americans \u201chave never really had our place in capitalism,\u201d other than as its engine, since slavery, Hersey says. Indeed, systemic racism has locked generations of Black Americans out of the wealth promised by capitalism. Plus, burnout culture, which glorifies sleep deprivation, can take a major toll on their health. A 2015 study found that, compared to white participants, Black participants were five times more likely to sleep less than six hours a night. Poor sleep has been associated with diabetes, heart disease and other conditions that affect Black Americans at higher rates.As the \u201cNap Bishop,\u201d Hersey, based in Atlanta, hosts collective napping experiences, which bring people together to nap for 30 to 40 minutes. She also gives workshops on how to resist burnout culture (even if you can\u2019t squeeze in a nap) and has performed a one-woman show featuring herself sleeping on a bed. The Nap Ministry\u2019s\u00a0Instagram account, where she posts quotes like \u201cYour worth is not tied to your productivity,\u201d and \u201cNaps are not lazy\u201d has garnered nearly 20,000 followers. We talked to Hersey about soul care, her favorite nap spots, and the old school R&B album she has on repeat.Self-care is important, but.... I\u2019m really interested in soul care, which takes a deeper view of yourself as a human being worthy of self-care. The care comes from you, not from a massage therapist or getting your nails done. We\u2019re often quicker to buy an expensive spa product than we are to take a nap\u2014but what has gotten into our souls that we don\u2019t think we\u2019re worthy of sleep?  You can\u2019t even get to self-care until you can look at what\u2019s happening on a soul level.The Black community in particular needs rest because\u2026 of the weathering of Black bodies from just living and trying to survive, and at the same time experiencing microaggressions every day. If anyone should be sleeping, it\u2019s Black people, when you consider how our ancestors built this country with their free labor and no rest. Reparations don\u2019t have to look like a check; they can come in the form of rest. Rest is a healing portal into a space where things can be different, a place that\u2019s sacred for you where you don\u2019t have to deal with microaggressions.I nap\u2026 on my couch for 30 to 45 minutes between 2:00 and 3:00 p.m. My sister makes me these beautiful, warm crochet blankets. It feels like they have sleep magic in them. I fall asleep under them all the time. I also love herbal teas. My friend crafted a beautiful tea for the Nap Ministry that has mugwort and chamomile, which can help you to relax. On days I can\u2019t nap, I love to close my eyes and zone out. I do a lot of daydreaming, which is like a mini-nap.I love napping in\u2026  libraries. There\u2019s some type of anointed spirit of sleep in the library\u2014the quiet, the books. I like sleeping outdoors too, like on picnics or camping trips.My dream is for the Nap Ministry to\u2026 become a global movement. I would love to have my own nap temple, a huge space where people can come nap, and train people as nap ministers. I can teach people around the country theories around rest and how to host their own napping events, and help them be ordained in this whole practice.I can\u2019t stop watching\u2026 The Real Housewives of New York City. There\u2019s something about those New York uptown women. They are out of control! Because I\u2019m reading slave narratives all day, I love my little trash TV. But The Real Housewives of Atlanta is my favorite because it\u2019s Black women, it\u2019s Black-centric and it\u2019s here in town.Besides napping, my favorite wellness ritual is\u2026 taking baths. I feel like there\u2019s something somatic that\u2019s happening in the water that heals. I have this 30-pound container of pink Himalayan Epsom salt that helps relax your muscles. I also make my own bath salts with Epsom salt, baking soda and essential oils. I love orange and tangerine essential oils if I need a pick-me-up, lavender and rosemary if I need to calm down. I set out candles and crystals and a Bluetooth speaker to play the Nap Ministry Spotify playlist.Right now, I\u2019m listening to\u2026old school Chicago rap music, like Twista, Do or Die,  Soldierz At War. (I\u2019m from Chicago.) I\u2019m also really into trap music. I love the bass and how it hits a spot in your body that feels very ancestral. I also love old-school R&B. My husband wants to kick me out of the house because I will not stop playing Usher\u2019s Confessions.The book I cannot put down is\u2026 Citizen: An American Lyric by Claudia Rankine. It\u2019s poetry but also a mediation on race in America. She talks about these different interactions that happen with Black people\u2014micro-aggressions and also bigger aggressions, like murder and police violence. It\u2019s almost like she\u2019s just a citizen who is doing this ethnography work and watching what\u2019s happening in America around race. The poetry is unique in that it isn\u2019t straight and linear but more like these dreamy, meditative responses to things that have happened to her.Besides napping, I rest by\u2026 having really set boundaries and being able to say \u201cno.\u201d If you open up my calendar, you\u2019ll see I don\u2019t play. I\u2019m in there with a knife. I only say \u201cyes\u201d to things I\u2019m really passionate about. I don\u2019t schedule back-to-back meetings. I don\u2019t rush to return emails. I push back against the fast, fast, fast mentality. It\u2019s really hard because people want you to work at their pace. I\u2019m trying to retrain people and let them know if they want to work with me, this is the pace we\u2019re going at.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishPerson of InterestInterviewsRead MoreLifestyleClaire Fitzsimmons Is the Sexual Wellness Guide We Didn\u2019t Know We NeededBy Anya TchoupakovRecipes you want to make.
