Listing everything that goes into former Noma chef Philipp Inreiter\u2019s shio ramen would take up the entire internet, so trust. (Okay, a few teasers: There\u2019s porcini, \u201cloads of seafood,\u201d and chicken.) But this place is so chill, with its hipster dog logo and basic counter seating, you\u2019ll never get hit over the head with the message.ORDER THE: ramen, made with local house-milled flour, for the noodles that come out of a fancy-looking machine beneath Ren\u00e9 Redzepi and David Chang\u2019s graffiti. Get all four ramen, if you can\u2014shio, shoyu, mushroom, and a monthly-changing special\u2014plus pork gyoza with lemon-thyme oil; hay-smoked tuna tataki; lime-mint lemonade; and any liquor made by local heroes Empirical Spirits, Inreiter\u2019s old Noma buddies.THE VIBE IS: hipster gastronaut: people in line from Barcelona, Japan, New York, etc., vying for one of the handful of stools while bobbing to old-school reggae. Oh, and it\u2019s kid-friendly!PRACTICAL STUFF: Open for dinner Tuesday to Sunday, from 5 p.m. to 10 p.m., and lunch Friday to Sunday, from noon to 2:30 p.m. Closed Monday. No reservations; try going on off-hours to avoid the line.\u2014Christine MuhlkePhoto by Ditte IsagerPhoto by Ditte IsagerWE ALSO LOVEApollo Bar & KantineLook at contemporary art, eat some stellar bread at this Indre By hot spotGasoline GrillDon\u2019t be fooled by the gas pumps\u2014this mini chain serves Copenhagen's greatest burgerDen VandretteGet your L\u2019Anglore fix at this sunny Indre By wine barExplore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
