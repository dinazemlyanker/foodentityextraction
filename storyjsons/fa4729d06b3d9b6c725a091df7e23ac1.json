(Shhh. Listen closely.) Garnish it with the toppings of your choice: We like avocado, sour cream, and chopped white onion, but you can add shredded cheese, pickled or fresh jalape\u00f1os, and/or sliced scallions or radishes. You can use any tortilla chips you like\u2014they add body and flavor to the soup itself and go on top for extra oomph. You could also fry or bake your own stale tortillas, cut into strips, but if we're being honest, salty, crunchy Fritos will probably taste better.\u00a0All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Cut in half from top to bottom. Trim top, then peel onion skin and first tough layer; discard. Leave root end on. Make slices parallel to cutting board, starting close to the board and moving upward. Then make slices lengthwise from top of onion to root end. Slice across onion, again from top to bottom, and you\u2019ll come away with nice little cubes. Run your knife through once more if any pieces are too big. You should have about 2 cups chopped onions. Set aside 2 Tbsp. for serving.Step 2Smash, peel, and finely chop 6 garlic cloves. Separate leaves from stems from \u00bd bunch cilantro. Coarsely chop leaves; set aside for serving. Finely chop stems.

Season with pepper.How would you rate Vegetarian Chili With Lots of Fritos?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (40)Back to TopTriangleFiery, smoky flavor, might be best chili I\u2019ve  made. Instead of 5 cups of water I used 2 cups of chicken broth and left the Fritos for on top only. I immersion blended a small amount of finished chili for texture cuz I forgot to crush the beans. You can use any beans, I only had chickpeas and black beans and in they went. Avocado, sour cream, lime, Fritos on top. Great recipe!AnonymousMassachusetts12/22/2021I don't normally comment on recipes but this one is so stellar and so unique I just had to echo all the previous rave reviews. I have tried soooo many chili recipes in the past and thought all were just meh.  The flavor in this is simply outstanding. My husband could not stop raving about it. He recently went vegan so always looking for flavorful vegan recipes. Thank you for this one!!! MicheleBerwyn, PA11/12/2021This is basically the only chili recipe I ever make anymore. Sometimes I use different beans because I only have one can of pinto. Sometimes I forget cilantro and don\u2019t have the stems. I never forget the Fritos though! \nI also sometimes have this for lunches at work on top of half a slow roasted sweet potato. Definitely our favorite chili recipe KateRipon, WI 10/9/2021Normally \"vegetarian chili\" is a phrase that makes me immediately hostile, but this one's an absolute winner! It's rich and satisfying, and the garnishes make it even better. I tend to prefer a super meaty chili but the beans and tomatoes in this are so hearty that I don't miss the meat at all. Only thing I'll do differently next time is to add another can of red or black beans, because those are even meatier than the pintos.DuffuserEvansville, Indiana9/24/2021Absolutely DELICIOUS!  This is definitely my new go-too chili.  Super easy to throw together and incredibly delicious.  Alison JDenver, CO3/15/2021delish! What an enjoyable and hearty soup. Glad that I did not get indigestion from it!NancyAtlanta 1/17/2021This was sooo good - even my meat eating boyfriend loved it.  I added green bell pepper and celery too.  I would say CAUTION with the salt. I added 2.5 tsp of kosher AFTER adding the chips, specifically because I knew the fritos would add salt as well (this was still too salt and had to balance with lime) so I suggest add the salt after and taste as you go.  Also echoing the water adjustments from other reviews as I used 4 instead of 5 cups.K GravyCA1/13/2021This is the most delicious chili I\u2019ve ever tasted. My husband loved it, too. I am a vegan, so it\u2019s great to add a dish to the repertoire that my non-vegan husband also enjoys.Julie ZVancouver, BC1/2/2021We love this chili! The Fritos make it great! I've made it several times.MaxineBrooklyn, N.Y.12/17/2020I echo all other reviews!  I consider myself a good cook but have never been able to master chili...well, things have changed.  Thank you!  Wish I was able to print the recipe to save it for the future.  AnonymousSacramento, CA11/30/2020This chili is my all-time fave!! So hearty even tho no meat, and the Fritos add so much. It also reheats super well!AnonymousChicago, IL9/8/2020I am crying with joy (or possibly from dicing the onion) over how delicious this chili is. Simple ingredients but the flavor packs a big punch. The crushed up corn chips give it a sort of tortilla soup flavor. Definitely will make again! Victoria MillerWashington, DC 6/3/2020I LOVE this chili. It\u2019s simple enough to make on a week night and I basically always have the ingredients. I use chipotle chili powder instead of regular chili powder for some added chipotle flavor, but it\u2019s honestly so great as is! AnonymousHuntsville 5/25/2020Goes absolutely nuts! Did 3 cups of water, 2 chilis, sweet potatoes and carrots and I already want to make it again. AnonymousChicago 5/6/2020Smoky and delicious! Loved the texture the fritos added. I threw in a couple extra chiles to match my personal heat preferences.
