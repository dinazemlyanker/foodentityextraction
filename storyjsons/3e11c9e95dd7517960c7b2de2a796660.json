These pickle-y mushrooms would also be delicious piled on top of toast. Just sayin\u2019.Ingredients4 Servings1lb. 1\u00bd\"-thick boneless beef short ribs1tsp. kosher salt, plus moreFreshly ground black pepper\u00bdcup finely chopped hot cherry peppers or other hot pickled chiles, plus 3 Tbsp. brine1\u00bdtsp. honey5Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil, divided1\u00bclb. mixed wild mushrooms (such as maitake and/or oyster), stems removed, torn into 1\u00bd\" pieces1large shallot, thinly sliced crosswise5garlic cloves, thinly sliced\u00bdcup finely chopped dillFlaky sea saltPreparationStep 1Pat short ribs dry with paper towels; season all over with kosher salt and pepper.

I was encouraged by the many positive reviews, but ended up finding the flavor combinations were just not to our taste. The elements on their own were delicious. The elements combined over-powered the steak flavor. I can't help but wondering if this would maybe be better with a pork sausage or chicken?  I'm not sure I'm interested enough to find out.ErikaMichigan3/17/2021I made this with bone in short rib steak and it turned out delicious. I cooked it a little longer than the recommended times, just using a thermometer to make sure I got it up to medium rare/rare. Very simple but high impact flavor combination. Had it with a side of escarole salad, would have also liked broccolini or some dark green. Jane E.Minneapolis, MN3/1/2021My New Year resolution was to try a new recipe each week, and this made it to the menu tonight. It was so easy (although next time I will add cook time to the beef) and so delicious! We usually make seared mushrooms for steaks, and this was a great upgrade. My husband boldly declared ownership of the leftovers...Ha!Joann F.Waterford, CT3/1/2021I made this with Cod instead of ribs.\nIt was a really enjoyable dish.\nAnd there are so many ways to play with it.  I.e. Cod.  :-)\nAnd also what peppers you use in the \"sauce.\"  And what fresh herb you add at the end.  I did parsley sparsely.\nI saut\u00e9ed the alliums for a minute because i'm not that keen on raw garlic.\n\nI'll def make this again.  in some from.Clay PATL2/26/2021Loved this dish, I find myself thinking all day about how I can't wait for dinner, even if it is reheated. The heat from the vinaigrette is excellent and the mushrooms go very well with the short rib. I will be making this again soon, very delicious and super east to make. E KingRaleigh, NC2/24/2021I used a different cut of steak, and also subbed parsley for dill. Nevertheless, this recipe rocked my world. The vinaigrette and shroom topping gave this dish a little kick, a bit of sweetness, and some extra texture. P.S. give that salt the full amount of time to penetrate the meat!!LeighBaltimore, MD2/24/2021Can this be done with bone-in short ribs as well? How much longer would they have to cook?Marianne Norway 2/21/2021The dill and sweetness from the honey was delish. And the mushrooms were too! I cannot wait for the leftovers on top of salad.
