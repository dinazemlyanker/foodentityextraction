An official one. We wore blue \u201cHonor Patrol\u201d windbreakers and wrote up pink slips for running in the halls. In high school and college, the main reason I was out late was because I was studying. I had my first drink on my twenty-first birthday. I lost my virginity on my wedding night.I thought doing those things meant life would turn out as planned. But, last year, my career stalled and my kids became surly teenagers. Then I watched Hillary Clinton do everything she was supposed to only to lose, and I was done. I needed something to help me deal, or at least to take the edge off. If I ate any healthier, my life would be super sad. I didn\u2019t have time to run any more miles or do any more vinyasas. Booze was out\u2014drinking turns my skin the color of a plum, and hangovers suck. So, I turned to weed.Although still illegal under federal law, it\u2019s legal(ish) in California where I live, so I wouldn\u2019t be breaking rules. It\u2019s supposed to help you relax, which I haven\u2019t done, like, ever. On the downside, it may impair memory. But I\u2019m at that stage where I can\u2019t remember anything anyway, like the name of that movie\u2014you know, the one with that guy?So I put \u201clearn how to smoke pot\u201d on my to-do list. And when I write something on that list, I work hard at it until I get to cross it off. I just didn\u2019t realize how hard it would be.Everything Ben Stiller did on screen made me giggle. And I am not a giggler.I first met my friend P years ago. He had always impressed me with his work ethic, drive, and smarts. When we reconnected last fall, he told me he smokes pot. A lot. I was surprised; he just seemed too on top of things to be high all the time. But if I could be high like that\u2014kill it at work and life while being nice and chill\u2014then I wanted what he was having.One night, when I didn\u2019t have deadlines looming or kids to watch, I asked P to teach me how to smoke weed. He ground some green buds, stuffed them into a one-hitter, and lit up. He handed it to me and told me to inhale \u201call the way.\u201d I did. Or I thought I did. But he said, \u201cYou\u2019re just holding the smoke in your mouth. Get it into your lungs.\u201d He took a long drag, leaned over, and blew a ton of smoke hard and fast into my mouth. It burned like lemonade going down my windpipe. At first I couldn\u2019t breathe, then I couldn\u2019t stop coughing. When I finally did, I asked, \u201cNow what?\u201d He told me to just enjoy the high.We got under some blankets and started a movie. Within minutes, I felt a happy lightness, as if I was a birthday balloon. Everything Ben Stiller did on screen made me giggle. And I am not a giggler. But then there were two Ben Stillers in the frame and they were all wavy. I wanted to touch P\u2019s arm to ask, \u201cIs this normal?\u201d But I couldn\u2019t tell how near he was. I felt like I was on a roller coaster, rising, falling, spinning, going in endless loops.I stumbled to the bathroom and slumped in front of the toilet. It was the worst type of nausea\u2014I felt like I had to throw up but couldn't. I might\u2019ve fallen asleep on the cold tile floor at some point. P came in every once in a while to try to give me water and to see if I was alive, I guess. I finally vomited; the nausea passed.I crawled to bed and slept hard.When I woke up, everything looked bright and clear and new, like the moment I first put on glasses. I had so much energy, felt so clear-headed. Most mornings, it takes a cup of coffee and an hour for me to even function.I was so happy with this new morning me that I decided to give pot another go, to get that lightness, unbinding happiness, and morning-after clarity\u2014this time without puking. P was (understandably) not interested, so I found another teacher.I love control, so I wanted to know exactly how much cannabis I could take before I went from happy high to bad trip.The only other regular cannabis user I know well enough to ask this favor is a sharp, savvy restaurateur I'll call T. He promised me he\u2019d walk me through inhaling step-by-step. We figured I just got way too much in my system the first time, so we\u2019d start with low doses.First he gave me a pep talk: \u201cYou\u2019re always in control, okay? Weed can mess with your head, but you\u2019ll be fine no matter what.\u201d I love control, so I wanted to know exactly how much cannabis I could take before I went from happy high to bad trip.We started with a vape pen from dosist that buzzes after you\u2019ve drawn in 2.25 mg so you can gauge how much you\u2019ve had. T told me to rest my hand on my chest, open my throat the way I would to guzzle water, and breathe in as deeply, slowly, and evenly as possible. He said, \u201cFeel that? Your chest should expand and rise if you\u2019re inhaling right.\u201d We practiced: inhale one-one-thousand-two-one-thousand, hold it one-one-thousand-two-one-thousand, then blow out in a steady stream. Just like yoga.I put my lips around the dosist pen, which looks disturbingly like a tampon, and inhaled until it buzzed, then held and blew. T clapped. I drank water. We waited five minutes to see the effects, but I didn\u2019t feel anything. I did it again. This time, T and his husband both looked extra shiny. So did the cheese plate they put out.Twenty minutes later, I was back to normal, so I graduated to taking a hit from his freshly ground weed. T warned me, \u201cThis burns way harsher in your throat than vaping.\u201d He refilled my water glass, and I inhaled. When I coughed, he yelled, \u201cYou can control it! Just tighten your throat and stop it.\u201d And I did. Within minutes, I started to feel a little paranoid. Were they laughing at me? Maybe, but I decided to control that thought too. We were laughing together, right?Even though we had agreed that I\u2019d sleep over or take an Uber home if things went wrong, I was totally fine an hour later. More than fine. Sober enough to function normally, but without the usual tightness in my shoulders and mental calculating of work-life duties.When my dog\u2019s tail wagging made me crack up, I knew I had had enough.A week later, I inhaled on my own. I had just turned in a book manuscript and wanted to celebrate. I pulled out my Chemdog pre-roll from Henry\u2019s Original, which is made with a Sativa strain. T taught me a mnemonic device to remember that the other strain, Indica, will make you so tired you\u2019ll need to ride home \u201cin da car\u201d because you\u2019ll be too tired to walk. It was noon; I still had plenty of walking I needed to do that day.I went to the furthest corner of my yard, held the joint between my lips, and lit a match.When I got the joint crackling, I counted off my inhales and exhales while preparing what I\u2019d say during the neighborhood moms\u2019 chitchat. \u201cOh, I know! Those kids with their terrible pot smoke around here. Yeah, must be that house on the corner.\u201dWhen my dog\u2019s tail wagging made me crack up, I knew I had had enough. Also, my usual post-book-delivery freak-out\u2014\u201cWhat if they hate it? What if I never get another job ever again?\u201d\u2014faded. I stubbed out the joint, wrote down \u201csmoked 62.5 mg x 19.1% THC = 11.94 mg THC\u201d in my \u201cTHC/CBD\u201d notebook, and headed in.Now I know that I can handle 10-15 mg of THC and that I need at least three hours before driving or seeing my kids. (The one time they came home unexpectedly early from school while I was still high, they asked, \u201cWhy are you so happy?\u201d When I replied, \u201cI\u2019m always this happy!\u201d they rolled their eyes.) Given how hectic work-life \u201cbalance\u201d is, I\u2019m an occasional user at best. When I can\u2019t sneak out to smoke but really need to chill the fuck out, I stir 10 mg of Ripple or Mondo, both dissolvable cannabis powders, into mint tea and sip innocently.Cannabis has replaced drinking wine on bad work days, screaming into a pillow when my kids give me attitude, and eating ice cream to soothe heartache. But it\u2019s best when nothing\u2019s wrong. It lets me enjoy all the goodness of the moment\u2014of life\u2014without worrying about work\u2019s next assignment, getting the garage door fixed, and how to run between one kid\u2019s soccer game and another\u2019s band concert. My middle school self would be appalled; my middle-aged self doesn't care.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishCannabisessayRead MoreLifestyleHow to Entertain with Weed: An Etiquette GuideBy Mackenzie WagonerRecipes you want to make.
