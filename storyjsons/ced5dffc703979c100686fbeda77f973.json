RossApril 16, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Alex LauFacebookTwitterEmailWelcome to Red Sauce America, our coast-to-coast celebration of old-school Italian-American restaurants.My husband refuses to go to Little Italy with me because we always end up eating at the first restaurant featuring an adorable old man outside with a thick accent, a mouthful of flattery, and a promise of Chianti. Yes, I\u2019m a sucker, and I don\u2019t care. The food is never as good as my husband\u2019s (my mother-in-law is from Emilia-Romagna), but it\u2019s not about the food. It\u2019s about the Chianti.Chianti begs to be poured from straw-woven fiasco bottles in the company of oversize Sophia Loren portraits. The glasses are always too small or too big but somehow just right. Simply the color of \u201cred wine,\u201d Chianti often smells and tastes just as nondescript (despite the multitudes its patron-saint grape Sangiovese possesses). Sure, it has the potential to be earthy and romantic, its flavors of cherry and plum ringing with acidity like the strings of a mandolin. Or it can just be table wine.And that\u2019s how I prefer it: to pour it, to drink it, to talk over it with hands flailing. To let it take me back to childhood dinners at Vince\u2019s Spaghetti in Ontario, California, where my father washed dishes as a kid. To laugh about how I had no idea Buca di Beppo was a chain, and called every day to get hired as a host in high school because The Godfather was my favorite movie (the only R-rated one I was allowed to watch), I knew all of Dean Martin\u2019s hits by heart, and I had a \u201ctight five\u201d comedy routine about my nonna\u2019s house ready for theatrical kitchen tours. To reflect on how I didn\u2019t appreciate the crowds my grandfather drew when he\u2019d hijack the piano at Nordstrom to play Liberace\u2019s Italian medley. To remember all the things I don\u2019t when I\u2019m sitting at my own dining room table, dissecting the latest bottle from the Loire or discussing that morning\u2019s NPR talking points.Maybe that\u2019s why I love drinking Chianti at restaurants. It always brings me back home.Marissa Ross is Bon App\u00e9tit's wine editor.Explore Bon App\u00e9titRestaurantsItalian AmericanWineRed SauceRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
