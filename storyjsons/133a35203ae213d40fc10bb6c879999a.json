Maybe a promotion. Or an engagement. Or a move to a new city. Maybe the rekindling of a lost friendship or the birth of a child. Or maybe it was the time you opened that bottle of perfect, acid-forward, naturally sparkling ros\u00e9 from Slovenia. Or shared that vintage bottle of Zucca amaro from 1962 with your friends. Or when you drank an expertly-brewed IPA from the comfort of your couch. Yeah, those sounds a little more our speed.We drank a lot of great booze in 2018, but we each had one, the bottle of all bottles, that made every other drink feel unremarkable. From our lips to your eyeballs, here are our best purchases of the year.\u00a0Domaine Matin CalmeMy favorite thing I drank this year was this bottle of Domaine Matin Calmea Sans Temps, a natural wine from Languedoc. It\u2019s made from 100 percent Carignan, and it\u2019s a huge reason why 2018 became the year I loved Carignan. It\u2019s possible that circumstance had something to play here, because I drank it at a picnic in Paris as the sun set on the Eiffel Tower, surrounded by my close friends. Or maybe it\u2019s just the fact that this wine is really f***ing good. It had a bit of barnyard funk, followed by some slight tannin and mouth-watering blueberry flavors, like a still-warm pie. I\u2019m pretty sure I drank the majority of the bottle myself. \u2014Emily Schultz, social media manager\u00a0St. Reginald Parish Marigny Carbonic Pinot NoirI\u2019m going to go ahead and say that St. Reginald Parish Marigny Carbonic Pinot Noir was the best thing I drank this year. This is juice box wine par excellence, zingy and gluggable like a cold glass of cherry cola. It was all I wanted to have at my wedding, but I couldn\u2019t find any more in NYC (I think I drank it all). Then, through an insane twist of fate, I ran into the winemaker, Andy Young, at a party in Portland, OR, and like a BOSS he offered to ship me THE LAST THREE CASES of the previous year\u2019s vintage in time for my wedding. I get weepy thinking about it. \u2014Amiel Stanek, senior editor\u00a0Funaguchi Kikusui SakeThis has been the year of sake for me, and the little yellow 6-oz. cans of Funaguchi are what I look forward to pulling from the fridge when I\u2019m in the mood. (Sure I could share, but 200ml has a way of going down easy.) It\u2019s got a medium-sweet, slightly fruity, full-bodied flavor, but it finishes nice and clean. And because it\u2019s unpasteurized, the flavors evolve over time in the can, which means there\u2019s always a bit of a surprise waiting\u2014and that\u2019s something to get excited about too. \u2014Sasha Levine, senior editor\u00a0Jeremy Quastana\u2019s L\u2019EndemiqueEver since I drank Jeremy Quastana\u2019s L\u2019Endemique, I\u2019ve been wandering into wine shops trying to find something similar (having given up hope of finding L\u2019Endemique itself). \u201cDo you have any light, unfiltered Gamays kind of like this one?\u201d I'll ask, showing a picture on my phone, in hopes of tracking down a bottle akin to my highly drinkable white whale. I still haven\u2019t found anything I like as much, but it\u2019s certainly been fun trying. \u2014Meryl Rothstein, features editor\u00a0Mikkeller New York City MikkelleritaI  chewed on lemon slices as a child, so it\u2019s no wonder I\u2019ve spent my entire adult life in search of drinks that make the back of my throat pucker. I love saisons and sours, but Mikkeller\u2019s Mikkellerita was the first IPA to capture my heart. Chalk it up to the heavy hit of lime and slight saltiness (it\u2019s sorta like sipping a tide pool, in a really good way)\u2014or maybe the ever-adorable illustration on the can. I\u2019m not overthinking it\u2014I\u2019m just tracking down every can in New York. \u2014Aliza Abarbanel, editorial assistant\u00a0Alessio Vermouth BiancoI am currently very, very into Alessio Vermouth Bianco. I tried it over ice with a twist of lemon last summer at SRV in Boston, but it took me a while to finally invest in a bottle because you have to drink it relatively quickly to keep the flavors fresh. It\u2019s similar to sweet Italian vermouth, but it\u2019s more robust, herbal, and crisp. It\u2019s easy drinking and has a hint of slightly bitter citrus, with a honeysuckle-like sweetness to balance things out. I could drink it like water, which is dangerous. \u2014Alyse Whitney, associate editor\u00a0Bini Rosso FaninoI\u2019m going to get shit for this because this wine is so allocated and expensive, but the best thing I drank in 2018 was the Bini Rosso Fanino. I bought the last bottle of this 50/50 blend of Pignatello and Catarratto from Sicily on a tipsy lark one night when I was feeling very \u201cto hell with it!\u201d It tasted like the ripest, juiciest peach, with such beautifully integrated volatile acidity that swept through it like a long romantic sigh. It was worth every penny of the $90 I still can\u2018t believe I spent on a bottle of wine at retail. It\u2019s going down in history as the wine that ruined me forever. \u2014Marissa A. Ross, wine editor\u00a0Capitoline Sweet Ros\u00e9 VermouthI first tried this citrusy, nutty, herbaceous little beauty in a cocktail mixed with coconut milk at D.C.\u2019s Bad Saint\u2014and needed to know what the hell it was. Turns out, the stuff is made locally with carbonic ros\u00e9 wine and comes in a bottle as pretty as it tastes. I snapped one up and brought it home, where I like to mix it with Campari and gin for a real nice Negroni (or just drink it straight on the rocks). \u2014Hilary Cadigan, associate editor\u00a0Threes Brewing Kicking & ScreamingI drank a lot of really cool, complex, atypical, inventive drinks this year. But my favorite was one of the simpler things I drank. Threes Brewing Company\u2019s Kicking & Screaming, a pilsner fermented in a large wood vessel called a foudre, was a breath of fresh air. Just a bit of old-school hop flavor. Just a bit of oak from the foudre. And a body so crisp that the second glass seemed to pour itself before the first was even finished. In the age of fruit-aged this and triple dry-hopped that, this is a beer that tastes like beer. It\u2019s a good reminder that the simple stuff, when done perfectly, is why I started to love beer in the first place. \u2014Alex Delany, associate editor\u00a0Methode Sauvage Tierra Extra\u00f1a Cabernet FrancI\u2018ve been in a Lambrusco rut lately\u2014I love it, but sometimes you need a little variety in life\u2014and the bottle that has set me free is this jammy, almost savory Cabernet Franc. I picked it up during Labor Day from Psychic Wines, a very cute natural wine shop in Los Angeles, and it only took a few minutes talking to the shop owner before I was completely sold on the singular focus of winemaker Chad Hind (he produces wines in California from just two grapes: Chenin Blanc and Cabernet Franc). It was the perfect musky, warming thing to sip, sitting outside with the grass under my feet, as summer turned into fall. And even now too, bundled up inside my NYC apartment with the heater and humidifier on, as the year winds down. \u2014Elyse Inamine, digital restaurant editor\u00a0Amaro Angeleno2018 was the year I learned to like amaro. And the entry-level one that made me see the orange-hued light was California-made Amaro Angeleno. The notes of menthol and grandma\u2019s perfume cabinet that I had associated with all amari disappeared and were replaced with bright citrus, honey, and fresh herbs. It\u2019s equally at home over ice, in a spritz, or, on its own. It\u2019s amaro for people who say they don\u2019t like amaro. \u2014Rachel Karten, senior social media manager\u00a0Sipsmith London Dry GinI drink a lot of gin\u2014martinis, negronis, G&T\u2019s, gimlets\u2014and when I\u2019m treating myself I get Sipsmith\u2019s London Dry. Mostly because the swan on the logo appears to be saying, \u201cLet\u2019s get buzzed, you work hard, you\u2019re beautiful and smart,\u201d but also because it tastes delicious. Gin, delicious? YES. Sometimes fancy new gins crank up the botanicals and have an overwhelming floral flavor that doesn\u2019t cooperate with lime juice or Campari. I like a hint of botanical mumbo jumbo, but overall I want a smooth operator. That\u2019s where Sipsmith delivers. And so pretty. \u2014Alexandra Beggs, staff writer\u00a0Les Parcelles T\u00e8te Nat' Igny Ruse Ros\u00e9The best thing I drank this year was a big, juicy p\u00e9t-nat ros\u00e9 at Basically editor Amiel Stanek\u2019s wedding. It was the \u201ccocktail hour\u201d wine, but our table kept going back for more, until the bartender just handed us an entire magnum (we finished that too). It\u2019s like boozy grape soda, and I mean that in the best possible way. \u2014Amanda Shapiro, senior editor\u00a0Les Foulards Rouge OctobreI\u2019ve been digging Rouge Octobre from Les Foulards lately. It\u2019s super zippy and incredibly easy to drink. But more importantly, I can get it at my main wine spots here in Manhattan\u2014both Chambers Street Wines and Foragers Wine, around the corner from my place. I don\u2019t like big, heavy reds. This is the opposite of that. \u2014Adam Rapoport, editor-in-chief\u00a0Explore Bon App\u00e9titholiday2018Holiday DrinksShoppingRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
