Inspired by souvlaki joints in Greece, founding chef Charles Bililies weaves California ingredients with Greek sensibility\u2014and Chipotle lunch budgets.ORDER THE: meaty sandwiches: pillowy pita stuffed with shaved lamb leg, cucumbers, and a swipe of harissa-spiced yogurt or tender pork shoulder with cherry tomatoes. If that\u2019s not enough, get a side of potatoes dressed with rotisserie drippings. And do not sleep on the frozen Greek yogurt (the sour cherry one is our fave).THE VIBE IS: very Californian. Light wood counters and white minimal stools outfit the three stylish locations along with big windows that are propped open when the weather is nice.PRACTICAL STUFF: Check the website for specific hours and addresses of the three outposts in Hayes Valley, NoPa, and the Mission.\u2014Elyse InamineKassie BorresonWE ALSO LOVEZuni Caf\u00e9The iconic Hayes Valley bistro that's world-famous for a reasonTartine ManufactoryThe megabakery-slash-wine-bar-slash-ice-cream-shop-slash-restaurantMister Jiu'sFarm-to-Chinatown-table\u00a0in San FranciscoExplore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
