I\u2019m game for any variation: earthy, nutty buckwheat cookies with pools of bittersweet chocolate; chewy and almost wholesome with oats, coconut, and seeds; or classic dunk-into-milk worthy cookies\u2014I will happily partake.\u00a0With a name like Caramel Crunch-Chocolate Chunklet Cookies, the latest take on the CCC from Dorie Greenspan\u2019s new book Baking with Dorie makes a lot of promises. And with a couple of brilliant moves, it absolutely delivers.To get one thing out of the way (and assuage any fears), let it be known that there\u2019s no caramel to be found in the recipe. There\u2019s no finicky step of nervously hovering over the stove waiting for sugar to brown with a candy thermometer in hand, no bits of toffee and burnt sugar to clean off pans and countertops. Instead, in this shortbread-style cookie, the caramel flavor comes from the way the cookie dough is baked\u2014not on baking sheets but in muffin tins.Muffin Pan$10 $9 at AmazonBaking cookies in muffin tins is, quite frankly, a revelation: The all-around heat of each buttered muffin tin well means that the bottoms and sides of the cookies brown completely\u2014you get the flavor of brown butter and caramelized sugar with no extra work. And in the battle of crispy versus chewy, the high walls of a dark muffin tin mean you\u2019re guaranteed dark golden-brown edges with a satisfying crunch and buttery, crumbly centers studded with \u201cchunklets\u201d of chocolate. (Greenspan calls these cookies \u201cshortbread at heart.\u201d) The constraints of the muffin tin also ensure your cookies have no room to spread\u2014they come out tall, chubby, and uniformly round. They\u2019re perfect for stacking, gift-giving, and cookie boxes.Baking with Dorie: Sweet, Salty & Simple$35 $30 at AmazonThe best part: The technique works for (almost) any type of cookie dough. Want crispy edges on that everything-but-the-kitchen sink cookie? Muffin tin. Need perfectly round cookies to make into flawless stackable cookie sandwiches? Muffin tin. Want the best of both worlds with an almost doughy center but golden edges on some store-bought classic chocolate chip cookie dough? You guessed it: muffin tin. You may need to adjust your bake time a bit from the recipe\u2014depending on the thickness of your dough, the cookies might take a little longer in the oven\u2014but it\u2019s easy enough to gauge when they\u2019re ready: Look for brown on the edges and slightly soft in the center.Once you realize how easy it is to toss just about any cookie dough into a muffin tin without stressing over them colliding into each other (we\u2019ve all had at least one giant Supercookie mishap), it\u2019ll be your go-to for all of your cookie endeavors, chocolate chip or otherwise.As for Dorie Greenspan\u2019s genius, her cookbook is full of helpful tips, tricks, and nuggets of friendly guidance: Heavily spiced baked goods are actually tastier the next day! For the best layers, don\u2019t drag or twist your cutter when making scones! Add cottage cheese to your biscuits to maximize tang. Baking with Dorie is so full of baking wisdom, you\u2019ll likely reference it often\u2014but be sure to bookmark those CCCs.Cookie monster:Caramel Crunch\u2013Chocolate Chunklet CookiesThese chocolate chunklet cookies are ingeniously baked in a muffin tin, resulting in perfectly crispy, caramelized edges and soft centers.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titcookingRecipes you want to make.
