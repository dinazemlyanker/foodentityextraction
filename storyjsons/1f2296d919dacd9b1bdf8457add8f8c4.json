Like pretty much everything we do at BA, these hats, tees, and (soon) more are inspired by our eccentric, passionate, and occasionally funny crew. There\u2019s a tee dedicated to Claire Saffitz\u2019s beautiful hair. There\u2019s a tee dedicated to the unlikely catchphrase of one Brad Leone. There are not one but two tees that speak to our collective love of tie-dye. And it\u2019s all designed by the same amazing art department that makes the pages of our magazine look so good. Here\u2019s what you\u2019ll find in our launch collection, now live at shop.bonappetit.com; we\u2019ll keep you posted as we launch new products on the regular.The Tie-Dye ShirtsWhich is the safest bet: taking that ayahuasca trip, going to a Dead & Co. concert, or buying this T-shirt? We\u2019re gonna go with that last option. Hand-dyed in NYC by tie-dye maven Kalen Kaminski of Upstate, these limited-edition tees come in two colors: \u201cspirulina\u201d and \u201cAperol spritz.\u201dThe Bone Apple Tea HatThis hat features three painstakingly embroidered emoji: a bone, an apple, and a cup of tea. Get it?Adam\u2019s Favorite ShirtBe like Adam Rapoport, our editor in chief! Wear a shirt with words on it to the office! This shirt looks great with a nice jacket! Or not!The All-Day, Every Day ShirtThis is the lemony yogurt sauce of T-shirts. You wear it once, then you realize you can wear it every day, because it goes with everything. And if one day you decide you want to change it up, tie-dye it yourself!Extremely Subtle Fan HatIt\u2019s like the white T-shirt, but you won\u2019t spill BA\u2019s Best Bolognese on it.Legally We Cannot Say What Is Pictured on This ShirtAn essential accessory for die-hard Gourmet Makes fans as well as anyone who enjoys the-candy-that-rhymes-with-the-word-pieces, this T-shirt features Claire Saffitz\u2019s recipe for a peanut butter cup on the back.The Iconic Claire ShirtWill an elegant streak of silver hair become the modern-day equivalent of \u201cThe Rachel\u201d? Make it happen by purchasing this homage to Bon App\u00e9tit\u2019s pastry genius, Claire Saffitz.It's Alive! The Shirt!We are all lucky to live in a world with Brad Leone, a man with his very own understanding of how words are pronounced. Celebrate him with this iconic It\u2019s Alive! Tee.If You Have to Ask, Don\u2019t Buy This ShirtWhether you\u2019re fermenting garlic honey or making your own miso, the same piece of advice from It\u2019s Alive! host Brad Leone holds true: Crush the garlic; release the allicin. If you\u2019re not going to get this tattooed on your body or engraved on your tomb, at least buy the shirt!Shop: The Bon App\u00e9tit StoreExplore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingRead MorecultureThe Best Souvenir From Maui Isn\u2019t a Tan But These Serene CeramicsBy Elyse InaminecultureI Can Schlep Without Worry, Thanks to This Mesh ToteBy Aliza AbarbanelcultureThe Take-Anywhere Plates I\u2019m Using Instead of DisposablesBy Sarah JampelcultureThe Best Etsy Stores for Hunting Vintage PyrexBy Alex BeggsRecipes you want to make.
