Featured in Bryant Terry\u2019s book Black Food and inspired by her grandmother, Big Mama (whose buttery cakes were famous in her hometown of Winona, Mississippi), the batter gets swirled with a brown sugar\u2013cinnamon spice mixture. \u201cDrizzled with cream cheese icing, it will remind you of those pillowy soft and fluffy cinnamon rolls you may have indulged in for breakfast,\u201d Adams says.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Generously coat pan with nonstick spray or butter, then dust with flour, tapping out excess. Whisk salt, baking soda, and 3 cups flour in a medium bowl to combine.Step 2Beat butter in a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment on high speed until light and smooth, about 1 minute. With motor running, gradually stream in granulated sugar and beat until mixture is very pale yellow and fluffy, about 5 minutes.Step 3Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition and scraping down sides of bowl with a rubber spatula as needed. Reduce mixer speed to low and, with motor running, gradually add flour mixture in 2 additions, beating just until incorporated after each addition. Beat in sour cream, oil, and vanilla, scraping down sides of bowl as needed, until combined (be careful not to overmix the batter).CINNAMON SWIRLStep 4Whisk brown sugar, butter, flour, cinnamon, and vanilla in a small bowl to combine. (This is your cinnamon mixture for swirling.)Step 5Scrape one third of batter into prepared pan. Drizzle half of cinnamon mixture over. Using a butter knife or skewer, swirl cinnamon mixture through batter. Top with half of remaining batter; drizzle remaining cinnamon mixture over and swirl together again. Scrape remaining cake batter into pan and smooth surface.Step 6Bake cake until a tester inserted into the center comes out with only a few moist crumbs attached, 80\u201390 minutes. Transfer pan to a wire rack and let cake cool in pan 10 minutes. Turn out cake onto rack (use a small offset spatula to loosen if needed); let cool completely.Icing and AssemblyStep 7Beat cream cheese and butter in the clean bowl of stand mixer fitted with clean whisk attachment on medium-high speed until combined, about 2 minutes.Step 8Reduce speed to medium and gradually add powdered sugar in 2 batches, scraping down sides of bowl as needed. Continue to beat until powdered sugar is incorporated, then increase speed to medium-high and stream in milk and vanilla. Beat until icing is smooth and pourable, about 2 minutes.Step 9Set rack with cooled cake inside a rimmed baking sheet and drizzle icing over cake, letting it drip down the sides. Transfer to the refrigerator and chill until icing is set, about 15 minutes.Step 10Transfer cake to a large plate to serve.Do Ahead: Cake can be made 3 days ahead. Transfer to an airtight container; cover and chill. Bring to room temperature before serving.Adapted with permission from Black Food: Stories, Art, and Recipes From Across the African Diaspora by Bryant Terry (4 Color Books).

Made this for my family a couple of times including my birthday and it was a  hit.  Co-workers enjoyed it as well. Doesn't need to bake for the full time.  Check it after about an hour.  aldrich4Canton, GA2/9/2022This cake is delicious.  My family loves it and I baked one and brought to work and my co workers loved it also.  80 mins is too long.  I checked mine at 60 and it was good.  Very moist.AnonymousCanton, GA10/8/2021This is a question, not a review. That's a LOT of butter to use! Do you think this recipe could be halved and baked in a loaf pan instead? It wouldn't be nearly as pretty as a bundt cake of course. Any other ideas for how to bake it if I were to halve the recipe? And would you recommend a different length for the baking time?BarbiToronto10/7/2021Took it out at 84 minutes and it was dry-ish. Suggest testing with toothpick at about 70-75 minutes. Also, the cinnamon swirl was pretty meager\u2014suggest doubling it for a more unctuous result. Maybe even consider mixing some cinnamon into the flour coating for the pan.
