It\u2019s a cloudy Monday in late August and we\u2019re sitting at a four-top near the back of Flats Fix, a narrow Manhattan taqueria sidled up next to Union Square. This isn\u2019t just another random interview-in-a-quiet-restaurant selection, though\u2014and not just because this place isn\u2019t quiet.Until last February, Ocasio-Cortez spent most of her days working here, slinging tequila-based cocktails and living off tips from the happy hour crowd. Everyone knows her: the servers, the bartenders, the cooks, the regulars. \u201cI haven\u2019t been back in awhile,\u201d she tells me, as yet another former coworker comes up for a hug. \u201cThings have been a little crazy.\u201dYes. A little crazy.Last night Ocasio-Cortez became the youngest woman ever elected to Congress. But on the day of our interview, she\u2019s still processing the reality of  having trounced the 14th District\u2019s powerhouse incumbent Joseph Crowley in the Democratic primary. Crowley had been in politics since before she was born, repped the district unopposed since 2013. Ocasio-Cortez, a 29-year-old self-described Democratic Socialist of Puerto Rican descent, didn\u2019t even have a Wikipedia page. Her campaign spent just over 5 percent of what Crowley\u2019s did. And yet, on June 26, 2018, she beat him by more than 14 percentage points and rocketed into the national spotlight; not just as an unexpected victor who proved all the polls wrong, but as a shining light for progressives\u2014and especially young people of color.Here at Flats Fix, with its a zigzag of fluorescent lights and trip-hop playlist and giant yellow surfboard affixed to the wall, she\u2019s taking a moment to reflect.\u201cMy campaign started in food, and in a lot of ways evolved out of food,\u201d she tells me, motioning toward the wooden counter that runs the length of the restaurant, the bottles of Jos\u00e9 Cuervo and Patron stacked on shelves strung with red fairy lights and South American flags. \u201cFor 80 percent of this campaign, I operated out of a paper grocery bag hidden behind that bar.\u201d Between shifts at the restaurant, she\u2019d reach into the bag for her political literature and a change of clothes, then set out to canvass.She leans across the table, her jean jacket buttoned all the way up, her large brown eyes intense, magnetic. \u201cFor me it was especially potent that I was working in the food service industry while running for office because I wasn\u2019t, like, reminiscing on some summer job I had when I was a teenager. This was the life I was living.\u201dFor Ocasio-Cortez, food is political, and the most tangible indicator of our social inequities. Sure, as living beings we all must eat to survive\u2014and there\u2019s unity in that\u2014but what we eat and how much and where it comes from and what we must do to get it varies widely. \u201cThe food industry is the nexus of almost all of the major forces in our politics today,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s super closely linked with climate change and ethics. It\u2019s the nexus of minimum wage fights, of immigration law, of criminal justice reform, of health care debates, of education. You\u2019d be hard-pressed to find a political issue that doesn\u2019t have food implications.\u201dMost politicians, she points out, are disconnected from these realities. At the start of this Congress, the median net worth of members across both parties was five times that of an American household. \u201cMany members of Congress were born into wealth, or they grew up around it,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez says. \u201cHow can you legislate a better life for working people if you\u2019ve never been a working person? Try living with the anxiety of not having health insurance for three years when your tooth starts to hurt. It\u2019s this existential dread. I have that perspective. I feel like I understand what\u2019s happening electorally because I have experienced it myself.\u201dAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez as a baby with her late father, Sergio Ocasio.\nCourtesy of Alexandria Ocasio-CortezAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez was born in the Bronx, the daughter of Sergio, an architect, and Blanca, who cleaned houses and drove a bus to make ends meet. \u201cWe were poor, so I was used to eating rice and beans every day,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez recalls. \u201cAlso\u2014what do they call it in English? Cream of Wheat. I loved Cream of Wheat. With sugar.\u201dEvery year for her parents\u2019 anniversary, Sergio would dig up a traditional Puerto Rican roasting pit in the backyard and spend hours turning a whole pig on a spit until the meat was smoked crisp on the outside, juicy-tender on the inside. Those are some of her best memories.When she was five, her family moved to a considerably more affluent suburb of Westchester County, New York, where the public schools were better. But that didn\u2019t mean life got easy, she says. \u201cThe thing that people don\u2019t realize is that wherever there is affluence, there\u2019s an underclass. There\u2019s a service class. And that\u2019s what I grew up in, scrubbing toilets with my mom.\u201d But the Ocasio-Cortez family found their place in the community, inviting employees of the local Dunkin\u2019 Donuts over for Thanksgiving dinner, serving their turkey with pernil, a Puerto Rican\u2013style roast pork shoulder bathed in tangy sofrito.\u201cMy dad used to say that he collected people,\u201d she recalls. \u201cIf you didn\u2019t have a place to go on Thanksgiving, you came to our place. We never had a table big enough to fit everyone, but we\u2019d always have folding chairs. You\u2019d make a plate, eat it out of your lap, and share stories.\u201dShe wanted to be a scientist when she grew up, but her first on-the-books job was at an Irish pub, at 15 or 16 years old, working as a hostess to pay for her extracurriculars. She\u2019d split up the after-school hours: a few days a week working at the pub, a few taking the commuter rail into Manhattan to run experiments out of Mount Sinai Medical Center in Spanish Harlem. She was competitive, won second prize at the world\u2019s largest pre-collegiate science fair, got a small asteroid named after her as a reward: the 23238 Ocasio-Cortez. Oh yeah, and she always loved cooking because: \u201cThat\u2019s what it is. You know? It\u2019s chemistry.\u201dAs a freshman at Boston University, Ocasio-Cortez moved into pre-med housing. More science; that was the plan. But then she studied abroad in Niger, doing rotations at a maternity clinic on the outskirts of Niamey. The country, ranked last in the UN Human Development Index, was recovering from severe famine. \u201cI saw a lot of pretty brutal things there,\u201d she says, recalling babies born on steel tables covered in nothing but wax print cloth. Cemented in her mind is one particularly difficult pregnancy that resulted in a stillbirth: \u201cThe reason the child had passed was very preventable. For me it was a very powerful moment. This child\u2019s life was literally decided because of where it was born.\u201dSuddenly the path she\u2019d planned\u2014medical school, becoming a doctor, having a family\u2014no longer seemed like an option. \u201cI couldn\u2019t just go back home and lead a normal life,\u201d she says. \u201cI just\u2026couldn\u2019t.\u201d Though she recognized the importance of individualized care, she wanted to go bigger, deeper, down to the dark roots of suffering. So she switched her major to economics and began to focus on policy\u2014and in particular, the issues that affected her own community of working class people of color in the Bronx.After graduation Ocasio-Cortez returned to New York where she was hired as an educational director at the National Hispanic Institute, a nonprofit serving Hispanic youth. But she also went back to the restaurant industry: bartending and waitressing were necessary to supplement her income, which she used to help her mother stay afloat after Sergio died of cancer. At restaurants, she worked side by side with immigrants both documented and undocumented. Their stories and experiences informed her work as a local organizer.\u201cFor me what\u2019s important is to value the hands that go into your food,\u201d she says. \u201cAll of them.\u201dOcasio-Cortez at a bodega in Queens, New York.\nPhotograph by Andy HurAbout one-third of the people working in the food-service industry are undocumented, with most holding the lowest-paying jobs, like bussing tables and dishwashing, according to a recent Pew Research Center study. In the agricultural industry, that number rises to more than half. As a result, restaurant kitchens, food-processing facilities, and commercial farms have been a frequent target for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) since it was formed in 2003. But after President Donald Trump took office in January 2017, raids and arrests surged, and not just in the food industry.During the current administration\u2019s first 100 days, ICE apprehended 41,318 immigrants, up 37.6 percent over the same period the year before, according to the agency. But arrests of immigrants with no criminal record represented the biggest statistical increase: that number more than doubled by the end of April 2017. And we have yet to see the results of more recent White House policies.While these mandates aren\u2019t the only factors contributing to the increasingly severe labor shortages reported at restaurants across the country, they certainly play a part, especially when coupled with ramped-up enforcement at the border. Between 2015 and 2017, the number of National Restaurant Association members reporting labor recruitment as their top challenge more than doubled.\u201cThe tenor of working at Flats Fix became very different,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez says. ICE never raided this particular restaurant, but the fear that they might permeated the kitchen. Immigrant workers, even many who were here legally, began quitting and returning to their countries of origin.She recalls one long-term brunch chef, nicknamed \u201cGrande,\u201d who\u2019d been at the diner next door (where she also worked) for 15 years. \u201cHe ran the line like clockwork,\u201d she says. The Coffee Shop, as it was called, had once been an iconic New York City establishment, even a regular setting for Sex and the City. But after Grande returned to Mexico, the workers who were left couldn\u2019t keep up with demand. \u201cYou can\u2019t hire that back. That stuff takes years to perfect,\u201d she continues. \u201cOur kitchen got all messed up. We had to change our brunch menu because we couldn\u2019t handle the same volume of orders anymore.\u201dLast month the Coffee Shop shut down.Ocasio-Cortez celebrating her primary win.\nPhotograph by Corey TorpieOcasio-Cortez\u2019s platform is one built on her own life experiences. Her push for universal Medicare strikes a particular chord with the more than 85 percent of restaurant workers whose employers do not offer health insurance. Her proposed doubling of the federal minimum wage from $7.25 to $15 addresses the income imbalances brought on by the tipping industry and the 40 percent of restaurant workers living in near poverty. Even her calls to abolish ICE tie in to the frequency with which immigrant restaurant workers are targeted.\u201cIt\u2019s one thing to put your head in the sand,\u201d she says, \u201cbut it\u2019s another to actively disrespect and hate the people who feed you. Because honestly, that\u2019s what a lot of this anti-immigrant rhetoric is about. You\u2019re hating the people who feed you, which is a pretty messed-up thing.\u201dIt\u2019s this conviction, perhaps, that allowed her to win a seemingly unwinnable primary, even as a young, unknown, and underfunded candidate. Taking a seat in the House of Representatives never seemed out of the question.\u201cEven when things looked their worst\u2014like in January when it was just me and my partner in our apartment and I was bartending full-time while challenging one of the most powerful members of Congress\u2014never did I feel like I didn\u2019t have a shot,\u201d she tells me. Her communications manager is signaling we\u2019ve run out of time. \u201cBecause I\u2019m an organizer. I\u2019m on the ground. I know my community. We acknowledge that all this shit is stacked up against us, but we don\u2019t get to give up. We don\u2019t have the luxury.\u201dShe pushes her chair back, gets up to go, her taco only half eaten.Recipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
