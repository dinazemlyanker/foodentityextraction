Scarlett, a food writer, has immersed herself in Mexican cuisine during her three years in Mexico City, but here she uses local ingredients in dishes she and Jake miss from the States and stints at Andrew Tarlow\u2019s Brooklyn restaurants: avocado toast, roasted carrots, and a massive kale-vegetable salad. The latter is especially welcome in Mexico City, where greens have a tendency to be cooked\u2014or overdressed if they\u2019re not.ORDER THE: \u201cbig salad\u201d (tahini-dressed kale, beets, sprouts, egg, and pepitas); spicy roast carrots; and abuela-worthy albondigas (meatballs). At night, get the classic fried chicken sandwich.THE VIBE IS: open and breezy, with soaring ceilings and an upper level that gives a solid view of the artistic, professional, young crowd. The bar turns from coffee shop during the day into humming bar scene at night.PRACTICAL STUFF: Open daily from 9 a.m. to 11 p.m.; closed Tuesdays. Drinks from 5 p.m. on, with a very limited menu after 6 p.m.Photo by Jake LindemanPhoto by Jake LindemanPhoto by Jake LindemanWE ALSO LOVENicosMeet the chef who turned his parents\u2019 restaurant into a pioneer of Mexican \u201cSlow Food\u201dTostadas Coyoac\u00e1nNot just Instagram-worthy but incredibly tasty, tooEl TurixTextbook *cochinita pibil* in a scrappy taquer\u00eda in the heart of Mexico City\u2019s Beverly HillsExplore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
