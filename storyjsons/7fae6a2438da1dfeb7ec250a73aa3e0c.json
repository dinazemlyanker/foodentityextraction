When I was a child, my amma would make this drink, a traditional Sri Lankan herbal beverage with a porridge-like texture and a rich, herbaceous taste. \u201dIt gives you brain power,\u201d she\u2019d say, serving it with a piece of jaggery as a treat. But I\u2019ve never attempted replicating my childhood morning ritual because, like most good things, making kola kanda takes time: Amma would boil rice, scrape fresh coconuts and squeeze their meat for milk, and blend and boil leafy greens like gotu kola, moringa, and curry leaves. So when I came across Kola Goodies\u2019s Super Green Latte, I was thrilled. I finally found a piece of home.Super Green Latte is a powder blend of Sri Lankan kola kanda that mixes organic coconut milk powder, oat milk powder, gotu kola, moringa, and cinnamon. I confess: I had never come across a kola kanda blend before, so I was cautious about how it would turn out. But the Super Green Latte was exactly what I was looking for; it\u2019s just creamy enough and tastes fresh. You don\u2019t usually need any sweetener because there\u2019s monk fruit sweetener in it. The oat milk powder is also a great substitute for rice and helps froth up the drink nicely.Like me, Kola Goodies founder Sajani Amarasiri grew up drinking her amma\u2019s kola kanda at home in Colombo. \u201cAmma told me when they were young, she\u2019d watch grandma and learn how to make it,\u201d Amarasiri says. \u201cShe would use a pestle and mortar for grinding. Back then they didn\u2019t even have blenders.\u201dBut when she came to the U.S. at 19 for college, she couldn't find her family\u2019s morning drink in stores. Ever since, she\u2019s been trying to recreate it. The result is the Super Green Latte. \u201cGotu kola and moringa [are] the main heroes,\u201d Amarasiri says of the herbs and plants in the list of ingredients, which taste slightly bitter and have a mild, grassy scent. \u201cWe got it sourced from Matale when we visited farmer families during [a] trip to Sri Lanka.\u201dMore than anything, I love how easy it was to recreate my amma\u2019s traditional drink, especially for a nice energy booster in the morning. You just have to add two tablespoons of powder with a half cup of hot water, stir it well, then add another half cup of hot water. If you are looking for something creamier, substitute water with a half cup of warm coconut milk. The blend takes hours of labor out of the traditional process, and now when I\u2019m homesick, I can make myself a glass of kola kanda anytime.Photo by Emma FishmanKola Goodies\u2019s Super Green Latte$26 at Kola GoodiesExplore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingHighly RecommendLifestyleRecipes you want to make.
