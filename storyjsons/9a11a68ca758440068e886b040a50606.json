When something's so easy to make that you don't even need one. Welcome to It's That Simple, a column where we talk you through the process of making the dishes and drinks we can make with our eyes closed.When I was a teenager, I visited Singapore with my mother and her extended family on one of those classic ill-conceived vacations where every sight-seeing activity was laced with bickering and dissent. Stressed by the family drama, I consoled myself in food and found solace in our hotel\u2019s sprawling buffet breakfast. This is where I met and fell in love with Singapore noodles.While named after Singapore, this dish didn\u2019t actually originate there. It is believed to have been created in Hong Kong and is a fixture on restaurant menus serving Cantonese cuisine. My mother, who makes Singapore noodles often, humbly brags that hers is \u201csilkier\u201d than what we would find at restaurants. Singapore noodles are heavily seasoned in curry powder, which can create a mouthfeel that is gritty or grainy. Her not-so-secret \u201csecret\u201d is to bloom the curry powder in the oil, thus amplifying its flavor and coaxing it into a smooth texture, prior to adding noodles to the pan.While Singapore noodles is a tremendously satisfying dish traditionally eaten for breakfast or lunch, it also makes a quick and fuss-free dinner at my house. I always have a packet of rice vermicelli in my pantry (I love Kong Moon brand), specifically for this purpose. The other basic tenets of Singapore noodles are curry powder (any variety works but I prefer S&B Oriental Curry powder), vegetables, and scrambled eggs (traditionally, this dish also features protein such as shrimp, chicken or char siu, which I omit). You can use any combination of vegetables, making this a great fridge clean-out dish. Carrots, cabbage, zucchini, cauliflower, snow peas, or basically anything that can be thinly sliced and cooked in 3 or 4 minutes are all suitable.To start, soak 14 oz. rice vermicelli for about 8\u201310 minutes in hot tap water. While those soak, prep the rest of the ingredients. When stir-frying, it\u2019s important to have your mise ready to go before you start cooking so that everything can be added to the pan quickly. Slice 1 medium onion (you can also use red onion or shallots here) and place in a small bowl. Finely chop 1 clove of garlic and add this to a large bowl along with your prepped vegetables: Julienne 1 pepper (any color) and 1 peeled carrot, then thinly slice 1 small head of broccoli (stem and all, after peeling the outer part of the stalk). Finely chop 2 scallions and have these ready too. Now, beat 4 eggs with about 1 tablespoon or so of water (just to loosen it up) and season well with salt.Heat a wok or large skillet on high heat, and then drizzle with neutral oil (about 1 tablespoon should do) and then pour in the eggs. Working quickly, scramble the eggs until they are just set (you can leave it in large chunks, no need to break it up into small pieces right now) and then remove from the pan immediately and set aside.Place the same wok or skillet back on high heat. Add about 1\u20132 tablespoons neutral oil and then toss in the onion, stir for 2 minutes or so, until softened. Add the garlic, all the vegetables, and season with salt. Stir-fry for 3\u20134 minutes until everything is crisp-tender (soft, with a bit of a bite). Remove from the skillet.Drain the vermicelli. Drizzle about 3\u20134 tablespoons oil into the hot wok/skillet and add about 2 tablespoons of curry powder (curry powders vary in heat, so use more or less, depending upon your preferred spice level). Stir the powder in the oil for 30 seconds, until fragrant and a shade darker, and then add the vermicelli along with a few good pinches of salt. Toss well (I use long chopsticks or tongs) for 4\u20135 minutes, until the noodles are well coated in the curry powder; if it\u2019s dry, don\u2019t hesitate to drizzle with more oil. Add the vegetables and egg back into the pan and use your chopsticks or tongs to break up the egg slightly, leaving some larger pieces too. Taste and season with salt and pepper and toss again until everything is well mixed. Remove from the heat and top with the scallions.Eat this immediately. If you\u2019re feeling particularly indulgent, you can top with a few splashes of Maggi seasoning sauce, and some crispy fried shallots or toasted sesame seeds.Hetty McKinnon is a cookbook author, food writer, and creator of Peddler Journal.
