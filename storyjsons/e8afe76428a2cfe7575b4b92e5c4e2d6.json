And every December, one cookie steals the stage as the most ogled, most baked confection of the year. For 2018, that winner\u2014and by a landslide\u2014is Chris Morocco\u2019s zebra shortbread, a twist on the OG (literally), with layers of chocolate shortbread rolled right in. And if the black-and-white stripes weren\u2019t enough, the cookies coated in green and red sanding sugar\u2014just in case you forgot that Christmas is RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER!!!
