They are dense and resilient and need a long time on the grill to soften. Serve this summer side dish with a refreshing raita sauce and crunchy Corn Nuts on top, and prepare to be amazed.Ingredients4 servings1garlic clove, smashed4oz. fresh goat cheese1\u00bdcups plain whole-milk Greek yogurt2cups mint leaves, divided2cups parsley leaves with tender stems, divided2Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling2Tbsp. fresh lemon juice, dividedKosher salt1medium head of purple cabbage (about 2\u00bd lb.)3Persian cucumbers, thinly sliced\u00bdcup crushed Corn NutsAleppo-style pepper (for serving)PreparationStep 1Pulse garlic, goat cheese, yogurt, 1 cup mint, 1 cup parsley, 2 Tbsp. oil, and 1 Tbsp. lemon juice in a food processor until smooth and pale green. Transfer raita to a medium bowl; season with salt.Step 2Prepare a grill for medium heat. Cut cabbage in half through core. Cut each half into 3 wedges, keeping core intact. Drizzle wedges with oil to coat and season all over with salt. Grill until deeply charred on all sides (pretty much blackened) and a paring knife easily slips through the center, 8\u201310 minutes per side. Transfer to a cutting board and let cool 5 minutes (this also allows the cabbage to steam and become tender on the inside). Cut each wedge in half crosswise.Step 3Toss cucumbers, remaining 1 cup mint, remaining 1 cup parsley, and remaining 1 Tbsp. lemon juice in a medium bowl. Season salad with a big pinch of salt and toss again.Step 4Spread raita over plates; place a few pieces of cabbage on each. Top with salad and Corn Nuts.

Cover and chill.How would you rate Charred Cabbage with Goat Cheese Raita and Cucumbers?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (2)Back to TopTriangleThis seems a perfect blend of flavors. I will totally blend in goat cheese with yogurt (actually I would use kefir cheese for a thick creamy consistency to hold up against the herbs). Other veggie ideas are roasted peppers and eggplant. Such potential. Nandita SinghOakland1/14/2020The flavors of this were delicious! However the grill time in this recipe was vastly inadequate for medium temp grill. I let them go for 12 minutes a side and then rested then for 5 and they were still very crunchy. Next time I will bake the wedges for 20 minutes after grilling.
