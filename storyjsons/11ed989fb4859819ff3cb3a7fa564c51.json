Somehow, despite owning a smartphone/using social media/being required to use the internet for my job, I\u2019ve never seen the meme, learned the dance, or been able to tell you who is an \u201cold\u201d or \u201cnot an old\u201d based on where they part their hair. Does this make me cheugy? What is cheugy?So the good ice, the pellet ice, the GE Profile Opal nugget ice? That\u2019s a niche too small and too cool for my unhip existence. But like the rest of the internet, I did (if a few days late) read along as The New Yorker\u2019s Helen Rosner compared the crispy layers of said ice to \u201cwell-laminated pastry.\u201d After years of being out of the ASMR loop, the idea of ice that \u201cmakes a soothing, gently percussive shuffling sound\u201d sent a pleasant shudder down my spine.\u00a0GE Profile Opal Nugget Ice Maker$529 $499 at AmazonWhile normal ice is unforgivingly solid, a chipped tooth waiting to happen, the good ice is cush. Doused in a fountain soda or a cool pour of lemonade, it becomes a chompable little snack in your drink, a sensory experience extending beyond the brute force of frozen. These air-pocketed little nuggets are the main attraction at the Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf, Chick-fil-A, Sonic, and elite mall food courts. Also hospitals, where pellet ice is prized for its low choking risk and chewability. While you can, apparently, roll up to a Chick-fil-A and purchase a five-pound bag of chewable\u00a0ice, there is also a way to have the good ice at home whenever you want\u2014the GE Opal Nugget Ice Maker.I turned to TikTok, a social media platform I had heard about to learn more. For hours I lapped up videos of expansive suburban kitchens, a glossy GE Profile\u00a0Opal Nugget Ice Maker churning away on each counter. The Opal, you see, is not only Rosner\u2019s choice, but also the rest of the internet\u2019s. Affectionately called She across TikTok, like a seafaring vessel laden with precious cargo, the Opal churns out a whopping one pound of fresh\u00a0ice per hour. She doesn\u2019t need to be hooked up to a faucet\u2014just fill up the water reservoir and wait as She quietly whirs away, then use the cute included ice scoop to fill a Big Gulp\u2013size cup and aah. If your tap water isn\u2019t filtered, She does that too, of course; if you\u2019d like to schedule your next batch of ice via the mobile app, go ahead. This is primo ice making; expect all the features. The whole contraption, while obviously bigger than the plastic tray that gives you stale, freezer-burned ice bricks, is still smaller than a microwave\u2014a reasonable countertop footprint even if your kitchen is, like mine, definitely not suburban-size.At full price, the $529 GE Opal Nugget Ice Maker is not a flip purchase. But it\u2019s on sale for the holidays, and after hours on TikTok I\u2019ve yet to find someone who\u2019s had buyer\u2019s remorse. Each effusive video is tinged with the slightly embarrassed pleasure at having sprung for such a nonessential appliance. Rosner writes, \u201cThe GE Opal was an absurd purchase, unnecessary and indefensible. But it brings me the good ice, which brings me an absurd amount of delight.\u201d I use my Vitamix and my espresso machine every morning\u2014and for the price of those two I could have purchased three GE ice machines\u2014but my love for them cannot hold a candle to the passionate, obsessive ardor that Ice People have for their Opals. If you\u2019re going to splurge for one big-ticket item this season, why get something practical like a vacuum when you could buy yourself an unending supply of frivolous joy?With no childhood memories of Sonic ice myself, I\u2019m still mulling it over. But just in case, I asked my dentist. \u201cI can\u2019t ever endorse ice crunching,\u201d he told me. \u201cBut that soft food court ice? That\u2019s not as bad. Actually, I\u2019ll admit it...it\u2019s kind of good.\u201dIt's cocktail time:Explore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
