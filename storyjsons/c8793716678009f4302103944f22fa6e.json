Its Antipasto PlatterZeppoli in Collingswood, New Jersey, sets the bar.By Alex DelanyApril 16, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Alex LauFacebookTwitterEmailWelcome to Red Sauce America, our coast-to-coast celebration of old-school Italian-American restaurants.You\u2019ll find the king of antipasto platters at Zeppoli in Collingswood, New Jersey. Overflowing with meats, cheeses, and veg, it\u2019s an embarrassment of locally sourced, thoughtfully prepared riches that can be scaled up based on your party\u2019s size\u2014which means no fighting over the best parts. Chef Joey Baldino\u2019s philosophy is that once you hit the minimum prereqs\u2014one cured meat, one cheese, and two veg\u2014you\u2019re free to choose your own path. For him that means leaning on a huge array of vegetables for a food tour\u2019s worth of Sicilian flavors, textures, and colors. Here\u2019s what makes his plate supreme:THE MEATSSopressata: These sweet, salty, fatty, tangy logs of cured pork are made at Claudio Specialty Foods in Philly\u2019s Italian Market, which is where much of Zeppoli\u2019s meats and cheeses come from. When sliced, they\u2019re destined to be wrapped around cheese or maybe even a vegetable (you know, for health).Mortadella: Meat number two\u2014let\u2019s call it the deputy\u2014should have a different texture from the first since a perfect antipasto plate is all about contrast. Hence, soft, bologna-like mortadella to contrast with the hard sopressata.THE CHEESESProvolone: Aged for at least four months, this is sharper than the stuff you\u2019ll find sliced at a deli but still versatile enough not to dominate the plate.Baked Ricotta: Baldino\u2019s creamy, wonderfully springy cow\u2019s-milk ricotta is made in-house, then baked for a deep, toasty flavor.Fresh Mozzarella: Baldino also sources his mozzarella from Claudio, where it\u2019s made fresh daily. Then he tosses it in olive oil, basil, parsley, and chile flakes for a milder counterpoint to the provolone\u2014a nice resting point for your palette. Annnnnd...your rest is over.THE VEGETABLESPickled Beets: A refreshing, high-acid intermission from all that cheese and meat, plus a little extra flavor thanks to Baldino\u2019s star anise\u2013loaded brine.Mushroom Salad: Crimini mushrooms get mixed up with rosemary, parsley, and chile oil, then cooked low and slow to concentrate the earthy flavor and dry heat.Grilled Long Hots: These lanky green guys are the official chile of South Jersey, grown by many farmers in the area. They pack serious heat and are best followed by a nice cooling bite of cheese.Roasted Carrot Salad: Made with carrots from the Collingswood Farmers\u2019 Market and seasoned with super-fragrant dried Sicilian oregano, this salad tastes dirty and funky in the best possible way.Roasted Squash Agrodolce: Agrodolce, that tantalizing sweet and sour flavor combo, is huge in Sicilian food. The tangy dressing balances perfectly with the natural sweetness of the squash.Roasted Red Peppers: A staple on any antipasto plate, these red bell peppers are roasted in-house\u2014never poured from a jar.Stuffed Pepper: Cherry peppers packed with prosciutto and provolone are kind of like an entire antipasto platter in one bite, and thus Baldino\u2019s favorite part of the spread\u2014a direct shot to the briny, spicy, creamy Italian flavors of his childhood.Roasted Cauliflower: Tossed with salted anchovies before it\u2019s cooked, this lucky cruciferae gets an extra-deep, umami-loaded flavor that holds its own on the plate.Eggplant Caponata: A Sicilian classic, defined by red wine vinegar and warm spices for another hit of sweet-sour flavor.Sun-Dried Tomatoes: Baldino slow-dries plump, tender New Jersey Roma tomatoes overnight in Zeppoli\u2019s ovens during the summer. Come winter, he imports them pre-dried from Sicily to keep the quality high.Grilled Zucchini: An unadulterated vegetable is key to balancing out all the strong flavors of an antipasto platter. Here, a simple seasoning of salt, pepper, and olive oil lets that delicate zucchini flavor and bitter char shine.Saut\u00e9ed Asparagus: Okay, okay, maybe you need two unadulterated vegetables.Grilled Corn Salad: Jersey corn, charred and tossed with ricotta, chives, and olive oil, brings a bright, fresh dose of natural sweetness.THE FISHTuna and White Bean Salad: Full of rich, olive oil\u2013packed tuna (read: nothing like that stuff that\u2019s been sitting all day at the deli bar), this salad is all about creamy textures and fatty richness.THE EGGSFrittata: Frittatas are more commonly seen in Italian antipasto than their Italian-American counterparts. Baldino\u2019s is flavored with saffron and full of\u2026spaghetti, which is actually a traditional frittata filler back in the motherland.Alex Delany is an associate editor at Bon App\u00e9tit.Explore Bon App\u00e9titItalian AmericanRestaurantsAntipastoRed SauceRead MorerestaurantsRed Sauce AmericaBy Bon App\u00e9titRecipes you want to make.
