I'll be making this a lot this summer!!!  cproctor5West Virginia7/8/2020Super easy, quick, and refreshing summer salad and most ingredients I had from other recipes I\u2019d used them in! Loved itAnonymousATL7/7/2020Super easy and super delicious. The sesame seeds are essential for texture and bringing all of these flavors together. We've been using peaches for the unripe fruit and have been very happy.\n\nHolds well enough for a day or two in the fridge.ngcarr92Seattle, WA6/30/2020An interesting salad- great flavors and a fun option for summer. There's a slight feeling of something missing but it's hard to nail down.
