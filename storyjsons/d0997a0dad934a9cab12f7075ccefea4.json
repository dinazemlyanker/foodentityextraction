There\u2019s something undeniably fun about those shrink-rayed butternut squash (they call \u2019em Honeynuts, awww!), two-bite apple pies, and cocktail pigs in a blanket. It\u2019s rarer, however, for things to go the other direction. Probably because Honey I Shrunk the Kids-ing a quiche into something tiny is easier and more normal than, say, making a macaron the size of your face or a basketball-size arancini. On the rare occasion that small food can successfully go large format, it feels festive and special. Big food? Oh, yeah: That\u2019s party food.Mumbai Modern, a new cookbook by Amisha Dodhia Gurbani, which comes out November 2, is full of fun twists on Indian home cooking, utilizing bright flavors and comforting ingredients in delicious ways. \u201cVegetarian recipes inspired by Indian roots and California cuisine\u201d reads the book\u2019s subtitle, and the produce-laden recipes deliver on that promise. Think pear and chai masala cinnamon rolls, paneer skewers in a cilantro-peanut pesto, and what Gurbani calls the \u201cUltimate Mumbai-California Veggie Burger,\u201d which, wow, sign me up. But in flipping through the book the first time, the recipe that sent me to the grocery store immediately was for a cheesy samosa tart.Mumbai Modern$35 at AmazonThis tart is exactly as delightful as it sounds: all of the flavors of a samosa, plus a layer of melty Fontina cheese, blown up to party-size proportions. With the help of a sheet of frozen puff pastry, it\u2019s relatively easy to make and almost impossibly buttery and flaky, exactly the kind of thing I\u2019d be thrilled to find next to the charcuterie plate. From the dough up, it boasts a layer of caramelized onions, the aforementioned cheese, a spiced potato-and-pea mixture, and an array of toppings and finishing touches: fresh cilantro, sweet pomegranate seeds, a green cilantro-mint chutney, and a tart tamarind-date chutney. (If your neck is sore from nodding affirmatively to every additional layer, same.) It\u2019s a riot of flavors and textures, ping-ponging from sweet to herby to savory to gooey to crisp to saucy. And because it\u2019s one flat, square tart as opposed to a whole bunch of folded, stuffed, and deep-fried pastries, it\u2019s the kind of thing that\u2019s doable in the hour before your guests arrive.Gurbani\u2019s original recipe makes two 10-inch samosa tarts, which, when cut into small squares, is ideal for a big gathering. But we scaled the recipe down to just one, which easily serves eight people as a party appetizer, or four if you decide to make the dang thing for dinner (have done it and can confirm, it\u2019s a great plan). If you want to work ahead, you can make many of the components\u2014the caramelized onions, potato-and-pea filling, and herby green chutney\u2014a day in advance, and assemble and bake the tart right before you plan to serve. When your guests ask what this magical, flaky, fully loaded dish is, you can go ahead and tell them: It\u2019s a samosa...gone big.Get the Recipe:Samosa Tart With Caramelized Onions and FontinaWhen you're not up for deep frying, bake a samosa's spiced potato filling into a buttery, flaky bed of puff pastry instead.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titcookingRecipes you want to make.
