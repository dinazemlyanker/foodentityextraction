It\u2019s impressive. It\u2019s low-effort. It\u2019s the only way we\u2019re getting through winter.By Molly BazDecember 12, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Alex Lau, food styling by Susie Theodorou, prop styling by Elizabeth JaimeFacebookTwitterEmailSure, sure, you\u2019ve cooked with red wine before. A splish-splash here, a half a cup there. We\u2019ve all done it. But have you ever made pasta using two entire bottles of red wine?! I didn\u2019t think so. I have. And I think you\u2019re gonna wanna give it a shot.I had the pleasure of making one seriously delicious wine-stained pasta during a visit to Montreal\u2019s very beloved coffee-pizza-wine joint Elena last winter, right about the time they put it back on the menu. People have gone so crazy for it, it\u2019s become a mainstay. I mean, it makes sense: A wine-centric restaurant known for their wine soaked pasta\u2014what could be more symbiotic than that?But let me assure you, this isn\u2019t a gimmick. And it definitely doesn\u2019t taste like eating a bowl of Chianti. It\u2019s actually one of those low-commitment, high-reward kind of dishes that uses a legit technique you\u2019ll want in your back pocket. And out of the goodness of my heart, I\u2019m here to let you in how it\u2019s done.The only kind of red wine stain you actually want.\nPhoto by Alex Lau, food styling by Susie Theodorou, prop styling by Elizabeth JaimeTwo whole bottles of GOOD red wine get cooked down with garlic and red pepper flakes for about 25 minutes. (Make sure the wine is something you like the taste of. Steer clear of the nasty un-drinkable stuff when you\u2019re using it in this quantity.) The concentrated reduction will have gotten rid of any harsh alcoholic bite, but there will still be a \u201cwine-y,\u201d tannic flavor there. That\u2019s when two whole sticks of (cold!) butter get whisked in, resulting in a smooth, thick mahogany-hued sauce that\u2019s at once bright and acidic and creamy and round. Then, par-cooked spaghetti gets added to the pot and continues to cook while getting tossed tossed tossed, absorbing both the flavor and the deep crimson color of the sauce. Finally, a generous flurry of parmesan cheese tops it all off, because who wants pasta without cheese?Yeah, pretty easy.But if the thought of dumping two whole bottles of perfectly drinkable red wine still gives you pause, consider that this dish feeds eight (or more) people and uses two pounds of spaghetti. That means everyone\u2019s really only consuming one glass of wine. You wouldn\u2019t offer your guests anything less with dinner anyway, would you?Get the recipe:Red Wine SpaghettiIt\u2019s a showstopper. Two bottles of red wine get cooked down to a glossy butter sauce that stains and flavors the spaghetti.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titHoliday 2019Recipes you want to make.
