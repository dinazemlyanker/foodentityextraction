RossMay 29, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailTed CavanaughFacebookTwitterEmailPLOT TWIST: I am not a sommelier. I know, everyone assumes I am or was because I write about wine for a living, but nope. That\u2019s not to say I\u2019m anti-somm though. I\u2019m 100 percent anti-elitist-wine-bullshit, but the days of sommeliers correcting your pronunciation of Bourgogne with a snide laugh or trying to upsell you on an insanely priced trophy Cabernet are mostly behind us. There are snobs in every industry, so I can\u2019t promise you won\u2019t ever get one of those. The good news is that most sommeliers are totally nice people who just want to help you pick out a good bottle of wine.That doesn\u2019t mean talking to a sommelier is easy. Even I get flustered sometimes, when the sommelier is standing over me and I end up with a random, super oaky red blend because I mumbled \u201cI do love Arbois,\u201d and it sounded like, \u201cI do love armoires.\u201d But it doesn\u2019t have to be this way. With a little confidence and conversation, a brief encounter with a sommelier can lead to a bottle you love\u2014and learning something new too.Martin Ho is one of the world\u2019s great sommeliers. Totally self-taught, Ho worked as sommelier and general manager at K\u00f8dbyens Fiskebar in Copenhagen, as well as in Paris\u2019 Roseval and Tondo (now closed). Ho\u2019s knowledge of wine is only rivaled by his curiosity of it, keeping him constantly learning, humble, and relatable to his customers. Add a positive attitude and a love for natural wine, and there\u2019s no one else we\u2019d rather be talking to.Marissa Ross: Sommeliers can be intimidating. Any good icebreakers or words of wisdom to quell the anxiety?Martin Ho: I think a classic: \u2018Hi, I was wondering if you could help us find a wine for tonight?\u2019 or \u2018We are looking for a red/white/ros\u00e9/(whatever) for this evening. Can you guys maybe help me find a wine?\u2019I think it\u2019s very important to remember while there is a factor of intimidation due to fact\nthat a sommelier may have way more knowledge than you, at the end of the day a good sommelier\u2019s job is not to belittle you or to sell you the most expensive wine possible, but to find a wine that you want to drink.When choosing a bottle, what\u2019s more important: personal taste or the restaurant\u2019s cuisine?ABSOLUTELY ALWAYS PERSONAL TASTE. PERIOD.I often get questions such as: What is good with the menu? Or what would you drink? While those are very charming questions, wine is extremely subjective, and if you blindly go for the sommelier\u2019s choice you should be ready to be open-minded, otherwise you could be in for a bad ride.It is also important to remember that pairing wine with food is such a small aspect of the enjoyment of drinking wine. While wine can enhance the food experience it also carries the same weight in devaluing and ruining the experience.No one likes talking about money, but isn\u2019t it essential to choosing a bottle? Any sneaky tips on how to let a sommelier know your price point without admitting in front of your date you\u2019re damn near broke?A good sneaky way to go about it is to ask about 3-4 bottles of wine from the list at the price range you\u2019re looking for and then point at the wines you are inquiring about\u2014but point towards the price\u2014and ask for \u2018something similar.\u2019 It helps to make eye contact with the sommelier here. A good sommelier should understand and be a good wingman/woman without selling you out.But joking aside, a good sommelier will always ask you for a price point. If the question is not prompted, be proactive and always be honest and upfront. You don\u2019t really need to be sneaky about it.Also, if your date doesn\u2019t like you when you\u2019re broke, your date sure as hell doesn\u2019t deserve you when you get your paycheck. Just saying.So, we\u2019ve decided on a bottle, or between a few options. What questions should I ask to learn more about them?My personal approach to wine is more holistic than anything else. The one thing I enjoy the most, and that helps me understand the wine the most, is the story behind the grapes and the person behind the wine. Every winemaker has a personality and I do my best to know and meet them all. Having had the luxury of being from Europe and having worked in France for 5 years you get a chance to be close and personal with many of the small-scale winemakers. More often than not, their personalities and philosophies absolutely transfer over to the end product.Find out more about skin-contact wines (aka orange wines) here.\nPhoto by Marissa A. RossWhat are your favorite questions to get from customers?Any questions are great.  I really enjoy people who are curious and willing to learn. What is the different between white and red wine? What is \u2018orange wine?\u2019 What makes it natural? Why natural over conventional? I love discussions like that. I think it is important for us sommeliers to act as conduits or guides or translators instead of being perceived as this snobby grumpy workforce that\u2019s there to demean you. We may not know everything but we will try our best to help out for you.What questions do you wish more customers asked?\u2018Hi! Excuse me, we actually do not like this wine that much, mind if we switched that to something else?\u2019This happens so often. Either the guests blind orders a bottle of wine and they dislike it, or I recommend a wine they don\u2019t like. It happens. But what I always try to stress both for staff and for guests is that life is too short to sit through a dinner with a wine you don\u2019t feel like drinking.I try to approach guests when I notice they drink slowly or it looks like they\u2019re not enjoying it, but even then, it is difficult for a customer to feel like they are making a complaint; they don\u2019t want to be troublesome. But a good sommelier will not judge. A good sommelier will understand.There are no stupid questions, but which is your least favorite?\u2018What\u2019s your favorite wine?\u2019 Even if I tried, I honestly couldn\u2019t answer that.Should you ask the sommelier about their astrological sign, or nah?Why not? I like a good conversation as much as the next person. If it feels right and you are interested, why not?Read more: 5 Questions to Ask When You're Buying Wine (And Know Nothing About Wine)Explore Bon App\u00e9titWineRecipes you want to make.
