Hill Street in L.A.\u2019s Chinatown, she imagined it as a temporary site from which to launch a fragrance collaboration with a local chef. But then she expanded her vision. \u201cI thought, Let me do something fun that the community could really embrace,\u201d Sivrican says. \u201cThat\u2019s why I turned it into a market.\u201dPhoto by Alex LauNow Sesame LA is a neighborhood superette that doesn\u2019t simply feed the community; it engages it as well. The rotating roster of dishes, such as pickled eggplant and vegan duck noodle soup, is prepared by Asian elders in a kitchen run by Sivrican\u2019s mother, Judy Mai Nguyen. Some dishes are made by Buddhist monks and the proceeds are donated to their temples. A curated selection of Vietnamese candies and snacks line one wall while Asian condiments, both familiar and artisan, line another. Produce is sourced from local regenerative farms.\u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting our story and my mom\u2019s food to resonate with so many people,\u201d Sivrican says. But it has. \u201cIt\u2019s given us an opportunity to celebrate our culture.\u201dArtisanal condiments such as sakura blossom shoyu and whiskey-laced garlic black bean sauce are interspersed with longtime favorite kitchen staples such as Mazola oil and Sriracha.\nPhoto by Alex LauHa Truong, 78, is the kitchen\u2019s most senior member and Nguyen\u2019s first recruit.

She says she enjoys her time in the kitchen: \u201cIt\u2019s relaxing! I\u2019m learning many things; we all work together and get along well.\u201d\nPhoto by Alex LauMagnolia Blossom purple snow peas, Sunny Side Up chrysanthemums, Phoenix nasturtium, and Beauregard snap peas are all sourced from Girl & Dug Farm in San Marcos, CA.\nPhoto by Alex LauJudy Mai Nguyen, 72, is Sivrican\u2019s mother and leads the off-site kitchen where an ever-changing variety of dishes is created by a group of her friends.\nPhoto by Alex LauThe large vegan and vegetarian selection in Sesame LA\u2019s display case is an extension of Buddhist philosophy, which strives to cultivate compassion for other living beings.\nPhoto by Alex LauJennifer Pham, 60, is a close family friend to the Nguyens and helps prepare dishes such as pickled vegetables, vegan fish paste, and beef bourguignon.\nPhoto by Alex LauA veteran of Vietnamese restaurants, Nguyen draws upon her experience at the legendary Brodard in Orange County, CA, to create these beautiful summer rolls.\nPhoto by Alex LauMaster Thien Tue, 50, of Pho Linh Buddhist temple in Garden Grove, CA, cooks various vegan dishes for Sesame LA, such as fried spring rolls with taro, carrots, and wood ear mushrooms.

She will often suggest substituting local, smaller batch ingredients for the ones her mom has been accustomed to using; both are often pleased with the results. \u201cSo you have an older generation of women using new ingredients and discovering new things. It\u2019s joyous for me to see that for them too,\u201d Sivrican says.\nPhoto by Alex LauIt was Sivrican\u2019s cousin\u2019s idea to hang family photos in the store. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure about it at first, but once I started looking through our family albums, I realized I wanted to share them with everyone,\u201d Sivrican says. Photos include Judy Mai Nguyen and her mother in Vietnam, Sivrican herself, and her cousins in \u00e1o d\u00e0i, traditional Vietnamese dress. The black-and-white photos are of Sivrican\u2019s grandparents and their friends in Vietnam.\nPhoto by Alex LauEdible nasturtium and calendula blooms, plus chrysanthemums are folded into these beautiful summer rolls, or g\u00f2i cu\u1ed1n.
