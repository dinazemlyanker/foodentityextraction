If you too want to be invited back, time to pay attention: Show up on time. ALWAYS ask your host if there\u2019s anything you can bring\u2014or any way you can help\u2014on the morning of. Put your phone away. Take charge and clean up. If you think this sounds crazy, just remember that your friend, colleague, acquaintance just opened up their home to you, and took the time to grocery shop, prep, and cook you an entire meal! That\u2019s so kind of said person!But the real way to seal the deal is to bring something nice for your host. Bodega flowers? So lovely! A chocolate bar with pretty packaging? YOU ROCK! My personal favorite? A bottle of Domaine Glinavos' Paleokerioso, a small (and affordable) semi-sparkling, skin-contact wine from Greece.The thing I love about semi-sparklers\u2014Italian lambrusco and French p\u00e9tillent among them\u2014is that their soft bubbles, gentler than full-on Champagne or Cava, are the perfect thing for a casual celebration, like when your friend roasts you a whole fish on a Friday night. (The name \u201cPaleokerioso\u201d means \u201cold fashioned\u201d in Greek, and nods to the country\u2019s longstanding history of semi-sparkling winemaking.) As a skin-contact white, it also looks like a liquid sunset glow\u2014you know, that romantic orange shade the sun casts on just about everything on its way down for the day? Well it looks amazing in the glass and feels festive to drink. Have I mentioned it tastes INCREDIBLE, like bubbly cooked apples in a fresh apple pie, with a refreshing orange candy zing?Best yet, though, is that it comes in a petite 500 mL bottle, the most perfect-sized way to say \u201cthank you\u201d to someone who did something thoughtful. It\u2019s small enough that they could nurse it themselves while putting the house back together or after a long day at work weeks from the dinner. Whenever they decide to pop it, they\u2019ll be so grateful you brought it, they might even ask when you\u2019re next available to come over and share it.Learn more: Domaine Glinavos' PaleokeriosoExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendWineRecipes you want to make.
