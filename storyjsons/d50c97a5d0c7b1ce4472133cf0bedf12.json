It\u2019s a bright and palate-cleansing; a perfect side for heavy winter dinners. You want the water to be heavily salted to properly season the broccolini. Two tablespoons per quart of water is a good rule of thumb.Ingredients8 servings6bunches broccolini (about 3 lb. total), trimmed, halved lengthwiseKosher salt\u00bccup tahini2Tbsp. white miso1Tbsp. low-sodium soy sauce1Tbsp. mirin (sweet Japanese rice wine)1Tbsp. unseasoned rice vinegar1tsp. toasted sesame oil4Tbsp. vegetable or other neutral oil, divided2tsp. honey, divided\u00bdlemon, seeds removedToasted sesame seeds (for serving)PreparationStep 1Cook broccolini in a large pot of boiling salted water until bright green and crisp-tender, 5\u20137 minutes.

But boil time was too long it became mushy.  Luckily the sauce was so good it saved the dishjoanne hinh5/4/2020Loved this and comes together very quickly. I agree with the other commenter that the boil time was too long for me, I boiled for 5 min and it was pretty mushy. Next time I'll taste test at the 3 min mark and go from there.Julie LeeSeattle, WA11/30/2019Quick, easy, and delicious. A well rounded recipe. Anonymous11/25/2019This was really delicious and pretty easy to make. The sauce is highly drinkable. I thought the broccolini turned out a bit mushy but may have boiled a min too long. Next time I\u2019m going to try broiling the broccolini. kristinabronitsky9659Oakland, CA11/24/2019Explore Bon App\u00e9titTahiniCondiments, Sauces & PastesBroccoliVegetableFallSideVegetarianDairy-FreeHealthyishThanksgivingRecipes you want to make.
