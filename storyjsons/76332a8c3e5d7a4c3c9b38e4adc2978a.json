For Chinese American recipe developer and fashion designer Peter Som, it was a childhood favorite that has since become a staple on his Thanksgiving table. In place of the traditional clay pot, or \u201csand pot,\u201d Som\u2019s version uses a Dutch oven, which is ideal for keeping the rice warm until you\u2019re ready to serve it. If you can\u2019t find glutinous rice, also known as sweet rice or sticky rice, use all jasmine rice and add a few extra tablespoons of broth for a slightly stickier consistency. After cooking, let the rice sit, covered, for 10\u201315 minutes. (Using only jasmine will be a fair approximation, but it\u2019s well worth seeking out glutinous rice for this recipe.) And while any brand of Cantonese cured pork will do for its distinctive sweet and savory taste, Som prefers Kam Yen Jan\u2019s sausages.For the rest of Som\u2019s Thanksgiving menu, see his recipes for Asian Pear Salad With Peanut-Lime Dressing, Roasted Brussels Sprouts With Gochujang Brown Butter, Sweet Potato Tian, Char Siu Wellington, and Milk Tea Bread Pudding With Cr\u00e8me Anglaise.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

There's also way too much dark soy sauce - it overwhelms every other component of the dish. After quite a few adjustments the dish came out pretty good but unfortunately the recipe itself is pretty flawed. AnonymousBoston, MA12/6/2021I followed the recipe exactly.  Didn't have a problem with the rice being crunchy.  I wish I had added the whole 14oz pkg of Lap Cheong instead of only half.  Cilantro was a must IMOPamAtlanta, GA11/15/2021Thank you for the previous reviews to avert disaster. I steamed the rice (3 c. of Jasmine rice) in 3 c. of chicken broth and steamed the lop cheung (Chinese sausages sliced) in a rice cooker on top of the rice so the rice was cooked and lop cheung were plump. I prepared the other remaining ingredients & lop cheung in a wok and then added the rice back in. It was ok... However, I would NOT use the dark soy sauce again\u2013it makes the rice way too dark. I would use the light soy sauce instead. Since the recipe has so much soy sauce, I skipped the kosher salt. Not needed with the saltiness of the soy sauce. Next time, I will also skip the chicken broth. I don't think it adds much.nano Lsouthern New Jersey11/10/2021I second the previous review. Didn't anyone try this recipe prior to it going to press? More like a thick porridge with most of the rice remaining undercooked and crunchy. ScottPhiladelphia PA10/24/2021This recipe was very far from the picture and quite frankly a disaster. The glutinous rice made everything stick together, the image has the mushrooms whole instead of chopped and the sausage (which in the recipe is also said to be chopped but in the image its sliced) became soft after I added the chicken broth. The dish soaked up the broth pretty fast leading to the jasmine rice not being cooked while the sticky rice became a mush. I would definitely not make this again.Tati KIrvine, CA10/23/2021Explore Bon App\u00e9titChineseEast AsianAsianSausageMeatDinnerRiceRice & GrainsWeeknightEasyRecipes you want to make.
