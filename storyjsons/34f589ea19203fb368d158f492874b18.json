Bon App\u00e9tit's Executive Chef Mary Nolan just had to experience it for herself. She set sail to Rome, Dublin, and Corfu, to taste, smell, sip, and savor her way through some of the exclusive culinary tours offered on Princess Cruises.Here\u2019s a taste of her trip.In Corfu, Greece, Chef Nolan experienced the Greek Classics in Corfu Tour. It began with a drive through the meandering countryside of Corfu island, passing lush mountain ranges and crystal-clear waters along the way. \u201cThere were gorgeous, breathtaking views everywhere you looked,\u201d Mary noted. Once she arrived at a local Greek restaurant, Chef Nolan learned, just as guests do, the ins and outs of preparing a classic menu including tzatziki, taramosalata, Greek salad, and moussaka, a decadent dish made from layers of minced beef with vegetables and white bechamel sauce.ContentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Chef Nolan\u2019s next adventure took her just south of Dublin, Ireland, where she traced the steps of the Bon App\u00e9tit-exclusive tour, Baking at Ballyknocken. \u201cThe cooking school is so quaint, set in a converted barn,\u201d Mary explains. In the sprawling green countryside of County Wicklow, she joined TV chef and food writer, Catherine Fulvio, at Ballyknocken House and Restaurant, a 4-star bed and breakfast. There the two chefs perfected the art of the scone, and then savored their pastry over a cup of tea among the lush garden scenery\u2013exactly the way Princess guests get to enjoy the experience first-hand with this unique excursion. \u201cI love that this excursion takes guests out of Dublin into the countryside,\u201d adds Mary. \u201cYou really get to explore Ireland.\u201dContentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Finally, Chef Nolan headed to Rome to experience the Eating Italy Foodie Walking Tour, where she set out in the area of Prati to try one of Rome\u2019s most coveted cuisines: Suppl\u00ec, the famous Roman fried rice ball and Rome\u2019s first street food, at Franchi Delicatessen. But first, breakfast at the legendary Il Sorpasso. \u201cThe city can feel overwhelming with so much to offer,\u201d Mary said, \u201cbut our guide knew the city like the back of her hand.\u201dAlong her tour she sampled local wine, flavorful Italian olive oil, cured meats and cheeses, and, of course, sipped freshly roasted Italian espresso perfectly paired with a fluffy pastry. If that weren\u2019t enough to conjure every foodie\u2019s dream, she finished it all off with homemade, artisan gelato. \u201cI learned a lot about how to spot a good gelato place,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd like the locals, we got a dollop of unsweetened whip cream on top.\u201dContentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.On her epicurean tour of Europe, Chef Nolan was given access to a world of authentic cuisine, which is what every Bon App\u00e9tit-Exclusive and Bon App\u00e9tit-Recommended excursion is specially designed to do: marry adventure, intimacy, and authenticity, while offering guests a taste of local cuisine in Princess destinations around the world.You can find Corfu and Rome on the Mediterranean and Aegean cruises and Dublin on the British Isles cruises on princess.com.
