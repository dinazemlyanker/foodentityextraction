Reduce heat to a simmer and add onions and beet. Cook, stirring occasionally, until onions soften slightly, about 3 minutes. Pluck out and discard beet (the onions will continue to take on color as they sit). Transfer onions and brine to a 1-qt. jar or a nonreactive container and let cool. Cover and chill at least 2 hours before serving. The flavor will mellow as it sits.Step 2Do Ahead: Onions can be pickled 3 weeks ahead.
