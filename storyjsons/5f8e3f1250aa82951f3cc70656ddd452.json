In this case the gelatin mixture gets its fruit flavor and color from a combination of hibiscus and fresh raspberries, a take on Celestial Seasonings Red Zinger tea. The whole thing is topped off with a marshmallow whipped cream frosting. Chopsticks are the ideal size for poking the holes in the cake, but the slender handle of a wooden spoon or fork will also work. \u2014BA Test KitchenIngredients12 ServingsCake1cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, room temperature, cut into pieces, plus more for pan3cups (345 g) cake flour1\u00bdtsp. baking powder1tsp. baking soda\u00bdtsp.

Anonymous10/3/2021I haven't had this cake since the 90's.  I never expected it would turn up in BA!MattDelaware6/7/2021This cake was OK. (I would give it 3 stars, despite the website not letting me change my stars, which I entered in error). The half an hour given for the marshmallow cream was not sufficient and my frosting broke when I mixed the marshmallow cream with the whipped cream. A temperature range would be preferred. (If you're going to go to the effort of giving us weights for the ingredients, doesn't it make sense to give temperatures, too?) \nI also made this as two 9 inch layers instead of a 9x13 cake and reduced the baking time a little bit. (30 minutes total, checking at 22, 26 minute marks). \nI may try making it again. But would also like the ability to see other reviewers comments, which BA has appeared to not permit.
