So then you go to boil a pot of rice and dump in \u00bd cup of kosher salt, which renders the rice practically inedible. So how salty should cooking water really be?To determine how salty to make your water, you want to try to figure out (or guesstimate) how much the ingredient is going to absorb. Generally speaking, the greater the absorption, the less salty the water needs to be. If you\u2019re cooking a very porous ingredient (peeled and cut potatoes or squash) or something that\u2019s going to spend a loooong time in the pot (dried beans that simmer for 3 hours) or absorb the full amount of liquid (rice or quinoa made via the absorption method rather than by boiling like pasta), that ingredient is going to drink up a lot of salt\u2014which means you don\u2019t have to add as much of it.This seems like an obscene amount of salt\u2014but whole, unpeeled potatoes won't take up that much water.\nBut when an ingredient is not going to absorb much water, either because it\u2019s hardy and dense (like whole beets) or because it\u2019s only going for a brief dip (pasta, rice you\u2019re parcooking for cabbage rolls, spinach you\u2019re blanching for namul) make the water salty: The food won\u2019t drink up that much of it, so it should be concentrated. (That\u2019s why we recommend very salty water for boiling whole potatoes.)And to set the record straight, chef Sohui Kim of Insa in NYC says that pasta water \u201cdoesn\u2019t have to taste as salty as the ocean,\u201d\u2014this very detailed Serious Eats article explains why it really should not\u2014\u201cbut you do have to be able to taste the salt.\u201d In order to taste the salt, yes, you\u2019re going to have to taste that cooking water. So grab a spoon, close your eyes, and imagine the sea\u2014then aim for something not quite so dramatic.Time for pasta!1 / 45ChevronChevronOne-Pot Kimchi and Squash Mac and CheeseView RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titPastaNoodleSaltRecipes you want to make.
