He shares recipes he\u2019s been cooking, restaurants he\u2019s been eating at, and more. It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.If you\u2019ve ever wondered how a magazine (and a website and podcast and a video channel) gets made, now\u2019s probably not the time to ask. In the coming weeks, everything we do at Bon App\u00e9tit is going to get turned on its head. Yes, I\u2019m a bit nervous about it all. But I\u2019m also optimistic.In response to the coronavirus, we are going to evolve as a brand, and provide our readers and users with the service and content they need\u2014all while grappling with a compromised, remote working environment.We are going to rethink our jobs, while appreciating the fact that we have them. And we\u2019re going to approach our work days as creatively and enthusiastically as we tackle our tasks every other month of the year.To begin, I\u2019ll answer the question that so many of you on Twitter and Reddit have fretted about\u2014yes the BA YouTube channel will carry on. We have a month\u2019s worth of videos, already shot in the BA Kitchen, in the pipeline. They just need editing. But we will also lean into the reality that we all face\u2014holed up in our homes, cooking every single day. Our test kitchen editors\u2014Andy, Sohla, Molly, Chris, et al\u2014have all been provided with tripods and mics to shoot DIY cooking videos on their iPhones. That means you\u2019ll not only get to check out their home kitchens, but also meet some pets, and perhaps a toddler or spouse or two. Your guess is as good as mine. All I know is that I\u2019m looking forward to their trademark humor and cooking acumen, just in a different setting.Want this letter before it hits the website? Sign up for our newsletter!Photo by Chris MoroccoAt bonappetit.com, we\u2019ll do our best to chronicle the tremendous challenges facing the restaurant industry, but we\u2019ll also continue to provide the timely cooking and recipe advice you need now more than ever. And if the images look slightly different, well, that\u2019s because our editors are shooting their own new recipe creations by themselves. Not that I\u2019m looking to put any professional photographers out of a job, but I think you might be surprised at just how skilled they are with a camera phone. (The three images in this article were shot by Chris Morocco, who always makes a point of searching out the best possible natural light before taking his shot.)Our podcast will carry on, still turning out segments that we recorded this past month in our studio on the 24th floor of the World Trade Center. But we\u2019ll also introduce (perhaps less pristine-sounding) segments where I Zoom with my fellow work-from-home editors to see how they\u2019re holding up and what they\u2019re cooking.Photo by Chris MoroccoAnd, yes, we\u2019ll keep making a magazine, as long as our partners in the printing plant and distribution centers are able to do their jobs. We\u2019re currently shipping our May issue. Our entire June/July Grilling Issue is already shot and written. And our August Simple Summer Cooking Issue was, actually, photographed last August. Because if you want beautiful peak season produce, you need to shoot it during peak season.Oh, and on all of our platforms, we will point to and promote the food- and restaurant-related charities that can most use our help in these troubled times.And, finally, as always, we want to hear from you. What kind of content do you want more of? What can we do better? Talk to us. We all need the company right now.Explore Bon App\u00e9titAdam NewsletterCoronavirusRead MorecultureFrom Pandemic to Protests: How Food Businesses Are RespondingBy The Bon App\u00e9tit StaffcultureWhere to Buy Great Coffee OnlineBy Alex DelanyCoronavirusHow to Support Restaurants and Their Workers Right NowBy MacKenzie Chung Fegancooking3 Things to Make You Feel Better About Cooking at HomeBy Carla Lalli MusicRecipes you want to make.
