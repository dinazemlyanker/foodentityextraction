Hot-smoked salmon is sold wherever you purchase gravlax and other cured fish; in the supermarket it\u2019s probably stocked alongside packages of smoked trout.Ingredients4 servings1cup plain whole-milk Greek yogurt2Tbsp. fresh lemon juice, dividedKosher salt3Tbsp. whole grain mustard2Tbsp. coarsely chopped capers3Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil, divided, plus more for drizzling1large fennel bulb2lb. hot-smoked salmonFreshly ground black pepperPreparationStep 1Mix yogurt and 1 Tbsp. lemon juice in a small bowl; season with salt.Step 2Mix mustard, capers, and 2 Tbsp. oil in another small bowl. Set dressing aside.Step 3Cut fennel stems away from bulb, then cut fronds away from stems; you\u2019ll use each part, but they\u2019re prepped separately. Thinly slice stems crosswise and place in a medium bowl. Coarsely tear fennel fronds until you have about 1 cup and add to bowl. Remove tough outer layers from fennel bulb; discard. Slice bulb in half, then thinly slice crosswise; add to bowl. Add 1 Tbsp. oil and remaining 1 Tbsp. lemon juice, season with salt, and toss to coat.Step 4Divide seasoned yogurt among plates and use a spoon to spread it out. Using your hands, break salmon into big flakes and arrange over yogurt. Spoon mustard dressing over salmon and scatter fennel salad on top. Drizzle with more oil and season with lots of pepper.How would you rate Hot-Smoked Salmon with Salted Yogurt and Fennel?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (3)Back to TopTriangleI could eat this any time of day, it is so good. Light and full of flavor. We smoke our salmon with light seasoning to 145F. Saut\u00e9ed beets with thyme and butter go well with this for dinner. For breakfast, I serve it with a poached egg. For snack, I add rye crackers and when I run out of yogurt, mascarpone stands in. I imagine this as a great appetizer too. LOVE IT. Thank you so much for this recipe!AnonymousDenver5/18/2021Are you catering to a large crowd? Who TF has 2 lb of smoked salmon around?Do you Cater? 1/30/2021This made a fabulous quick lunch.
