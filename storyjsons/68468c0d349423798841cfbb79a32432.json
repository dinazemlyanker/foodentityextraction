Instead, use them in this simple no-fail hummus recipe. Chickpeas are whizzed in a food processor (shout-out to this one!) with the good stuff\u2014tahini, garlic, lemon juice, olive oil, and spices. Thinned with just enough water to get it light yet creamy, it works as a versatile dip or condiment: This rich, tangy hummus is as great swooped around the edge of your grain bowl as it is smeared on crusty sourdough or stealing the limelight on your next snack platter.Serve as is or topped with any number of different things, including lamb or chicken, good olive oil and flaky sea salt, pine nuts and olives, paprika and chopped parsley, or a sprinkle of za\u2019atar\u2014a Middle Eastern spice blend that usually contains a mix of dried herbs, sumac, and sesame seeds (available at specialty stores or online).

However, I do not know if you are aware that Chickpea is the name of the Hummus bean in English. So when you say Chickpeas Hummus, it is like saying Chickpeas Chickpeas, or Hummus Hummus...mixing 2 languages for the same name. Even in Arabic when we prepare this dish we call it Hummus Dip, because we have other dishes of Chickpeas. Avocados Hummus, means Avocados Chickpeas. Also Za\u2019atar is Thyme in Arabic. And when Za\u2019atar is mixed with Sumac, olive oil and salt, the mixture called Zeit & Za\u2019atar  is used to make pies on the Pita bread mainly for breakfast as it is supposed to open ALL brain cells...a must on exam days...referred to as the breakfast of the Champions. Also the mixture is very tasty for dumping bread, specially cubes of Olive Bread. Hummus dip can be frozen. Defrost in refrigerator and when you are ready to use, add a little water or lemon, mix with a fork to smooth it again. You can use it to flavor all sorts of vegetables, sandwiches, cooked meat, chicken, fish, etc...Sahtein (Bon Appetit) Enjoy your Chickpeas Dip ...I  have a Hummus Dip Club for all my Neighbors and Friends.....NajwaBorn and Raised in Lebanon12/5/2021Use the leftover water from your chickpea can instead of plain water. The chickpea water has more flavor.HallyUtah12/5/2021It's labor intensive but the only way to get truly smooth hummus is to remove the skins of the chickpeas or use chickpea flour. With the skins on the peas, it's grainy, period. #SorryNotSorryMHouston, TX5/18/2021Love it.  I prefer a more tahini-heavy hummus so this is perfect for me.  Leagues better than store-bought stuff and honestly cheaper too. Luke SDenver, Colorado3/9/2021It is good.  Quick and nice texture.  I cut out the pepper but I don't need that flavor.  Also love your videos about making gourmet junk food.  They are very instructive about experimental cookery.  Washington State9/6/2020I really love this recipe, it\u2019s amazing, and added a bit of paprika powder for some kick. However I found it to be rlly thick and I prefer smoother hummus so I added a couple more tablespoons of water and olive oil and it\u2019s perfect. 10/10 would recommend!!Nora.WSweden5/26/2020I like lemony hummus so added the pulp and a little extra juice. Threw in some cayenne and a bit of super flaky sea salt too while I was at it. This recipe will definitely go into my digital recipe box. Absolutely delicious!AnonymousNY5/13/2020Tasty, simple! I think if I remake it I'll add a little more water to loosen it a bit. AnonymousSeattle5/3/2020this is my favorite hummus recipe when i need a quick and easy hummus. my only complaint is it often comes out way too salty. omit the salt during the initial food processing and just add to taste at the end. you'll be glad you did, trust meAnonymousanchorage5/1/2020Totally delicious and super simple to make. It usually comes out too thick for my taste (and admittedly I don't add that extra generous pour of oil when I serve it so that might be the reason). I usually end up adding 2-3 more tbsp of water at the end to make it creamy. AnonymousNew York4/30/2020Just like what I get at the store! Which is good because they ran out. Added cayenne pepper for a little kick. QuaraMNtineMinnesota3/19/2020Really delicious! AnonymousNEW YORK 1/17/2020Really delicious, easy to make. I was proclaimed \"so good at snacks\" by all at the gathering :)AnonymousColumbia, SC1/11/2020We added 1tsp each oregano, celery seed, paprika and red pepper flakes; doubled the garlic and lemon juice; added 1/4 kalamata olives and enjoyed with lots of olive oil on top to go from 3\u2606 to 4-5\u2606!Anonymous12/17/2019Explore Bon App\u00e9titDipHummusChickpeaBeanVegetableTahiniCondiments, Sauces & PastesEasyQuickWeeknight MealsStarterVegetarianVeganGluten-FreeDairy-FreeSuper BowlLunchDinnerBasicallyRecipes you want to make.
