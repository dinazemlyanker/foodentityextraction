This buttery stir-fry features all the earthy mushrooms and crispy shallots you\u2019d expect from the classic dish but is done entirely on the stovetop. For less to do on Thanksgiving day, blanch the green beans the day before and store them in the fridge until you\u2019re ready to go.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

My husband \"doesn't like green beans \" and he has requested it multiple times. I use a nice sherry vinegar and olive oil, which is tasty with the rich buttery flavor of the mixed exotic mushrooms I use. AnonymousAustin Texas 12/24/2021made it for my family on thanksgiving     they loved it!toni bstaten island ny12/18/2021EXCELLENTERILEECALIFORNIA12/9/2021I made these for Thanksgiving and thought they were delicious. I used Chinese cooking wine instead of the vinegar and it was a great substitution. I love the flavors in this dish! I wanted to make regular Green Bean Casserole but I am GF so this recipe was perfect. Thank you!Emily R.North Carolina12/5/2021The vinegar overpowers the dish a bit - I recommend either making the green beans & mushrooms a day ahead to let the flavor mellow out a bit and top with the shallots & cheese on the day you plan to serve. OR possibly swapping out one tbsp of the vinegar with soy sauce. The vinegar was way too much when we first served the dish, but was perfect as leftovers. AnonymousLos Angeles, CA11/29/2021The crispy shallots are heaven, and everything was scrumptious until adding the vinegar, which totally killed the dish - inedible after that. Will be making this dish from now on out without vinegar.Anonymous11/28/2021Awesome recipe. So much better than traditional green bean casserole but satisfies that taste!AnonymousColumbus, OH11/26/2021Delicious and easy to prepare.tomthespudCoeur d'Alene, ID11/24/2021a-m-a-z-iiiiiiiiiiiingAnonymousDenver, CO11/23/2021This came out nicely. I followed the recipe but next time I think I'd take the suggestion to char the green beans a bit before adding them. I didn't really get the foamy butter that the recipe talks about but the mushrooms still soaked it up and got really fragrant and tasty.\n\nFor the time and effort it took to make this (not much) and the outcome of the dish (pretty good, 4/5) I'd put this in rotation for pot lucks in the future but wouldn't want to try to make it the star of any show.AnonymousWashington, DC11/14/2021Delicious! I halved the recipe for two of us and used some mushrooms from the green market and came together very nicely. I added more butter, salt and vinegar to season it to our taste.RachelColumbia, SC11/10/2021This was a lighter, fresher take on the traditional soupy casserole that Grace is most Thanksgiving tables. I used chanterelles and recommend you do too. \n\nThis is a five-star dish but a four-star recipe because medium high is much too high for crispy shallots. I had to cycle through two burned batches before finding a happy place on medium heat, stirring the shallots constantly, and watching them like a hawk.CambroWestport WA11/8/2021Such a great way to treat both the green beans and the mushrooms.  The added acid balances the nutty rich butter taste and the crispy shallots and salty parmesan are perfect toppers.  I have also blistered the green beans in avocado oil, instead of parboiling them, and the result was equally wonderful with a bit more char.  RoyCornelius, NC11/5/2021Excellent combo that tingles your taste buds,?had to make it before Thanksgiving to make sure it was going to be a hit \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d+TomChgo IL 11/3/2021One of the best green bean dishes.
