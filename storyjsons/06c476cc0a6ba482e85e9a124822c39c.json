I had baked with miso in the past but had never considered using soy sauce in sweet applications.To Asia, With Love$43 at AmazonI shelved the idea until coming home late one night from my job, needing to bake brownies for a friend the next morning. After starting my recipe, I reached for my box of Diamond Crystal kosher salt, which I had been meaning to replace for some time, only to find that it was dangerously low. Despite living in the city that never sleeps, there was nowhere I could run out to at 2 a.m. to pick up another box. A light bulb went off in my head: soy sauce! I would substitute soy sauce for salt in the recipe and hope for the best. It could have been a disaster, but the results blew me away. I\u2019ve made countless batches of brownies in my life, but these had a serious depth of flavor and a delicious savoriness that salt can\u2019t achieve on its own.Since that night, I\u2019ve been experimenting with adding a touch of soy sauce to my baked goods in place of salt\u2014it adds an earthy saltiness that I think is perfect, especially paired with chocolate. In desserts where cocoa is an integral flavor (think brownies, chocolate cake, truffles, even chocolate chip cookies), the saltiness from the soy sauce amplifies the chocolate and brings a pleasant umami flavor to the background. Soy sauce also works great in caramel, playing off the flavor of burnt sugar for a next-level salted caramel. In any recipe where you might add a splash of dark liquor or vanilla, try substituting half of the volume with soy sauce.As a general rule for sweet recipes, 1 tsp. kosher salt can be substituted with 2 tsp. soy sauce without adversely affecting the finished product. And don\u2019t worry\u2014your baked goods won\u2019t taste like soy sauce, but they will have an undetectable note that will have people coming back for seconds.My experiments made me wonder why we don\u2019t add soy sauce to more desserts. While savory ingredients like miso and tahini have become increasingly popular in baking in recent years, soy sauce has yet to gain such traction. As someone who\u2019s known to have a heavy hand when a recipe calls for a \u201cpinch\u201d of salt, I\u2019m always drawn to baked goods with a pleasant savory taste\u2014and the addition of soy sauce makes perfect sense. In the introduction to her book, McKinnon writes that the \u201csecret to tasty food is umami.\u201d It follows, then, that soy sauce, one of the most direct sources of umami, makes foods\u2014including desserts\u2014tastier. It simply offers what salt cannot.Since that late-night baking session, soy sauce has become my secret pantry-item weapon for providing a complex depth of flavor to otherwise-classic recipes. And now I\u2019ll never make brownies without it.Splash of soyCocoa BrowniesView RecipeRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
