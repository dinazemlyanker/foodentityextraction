I drink a lot of it, sure\u2014the natural stuff more specifically, which as far as I understand it is a loose, poorly defined term that more or less refers to wine made by small producers without the addition of weird chemicals and with the addition of eye-catching labels. But compared with the friends and sommeliers whose oenological ramblings I excitedly nod along to, I often feel like a poseur. I know my way around a wine list, but at the end of the day, I\u2019m a sucker for bottle art. I will always order the hypebeast wine I recognize from Instagram. I use the word funky too often. My wife, Lauren, and I went to a hip wine fair once and bought a poster we had seen in hip wine bars and hip wine stores because we thought it looked cool, not because we knew anything about \u201cCatherine et Pierre Breton,\u201d the French winemakers whose names were scrawled across the bottom. It hangs above our dining room table, and when we\u2019re having our Wine Friends over, I\u2019m always nervous someone will ask me about it, the same way 13-year-old me prayed older kids wouldn\u2019t see my Sex Pistols T-shirt and ask questions about a song that wasn\u2019t on the greatest hits album.Which is why it felt exceedingly trippy to find myself standing in a small warehouse in the middle of the Loire Valley of France at three o\u2019clock in the morning watching an apparently legendary 60-ish vigneron named Pierre Breton dancing to Blue Suede Shoes by Elvis, ruddy-faced, eyes closed, a pint of foamy draft beer in hand and a big cigar clamped tightly between his teeth.How the hell did I end up here?Illustration by Edward SteedLast November, at a Bon Appe\u0301tit pitch meeting, I threw a (wobbly) Hail Mary that went a little something like this:\u201cSo, two Decembers ago, when Lauren and I went to Paris, we were hanging out with Belle\u201d\u2014a former BA staffer who turned me on to natural wine\u2014\u201cand we wanted to go to the Loire Valley to visit a winemaker and then it turned out that all of the heavy hitters\u201d\u2014I do believe I used the words heavy hitters to refer to French natural winemakers\u2014\u201cwere actually going to be at this guy Herve\u0301 Villemade\u2019s place\u201d\u2014I was definitely at this point still mispronouncing it ER-v rather than ehhhrr-VAY\u2014\u201cfor this big annual open house party free tasting thing that you can just go to. He\u2019s legendary and this party is legendary and so we went and it was so cool and all of these people whose names I\u2019ve seen on bottles of wine were there getting drunk and pouring their wine like it was no big deal and roasting lambs over an open fire made of grape vines and it just felt like a big farm party and it was the first time I really got natural wine\u2014that it\u2019s wine made by real people who are farmers who you can visit. And I think it would be cool to go back and...write about it? Because Americans are so alienated from wine, they\u2019re completely cut off from the production of the thing, but if we could help them understand that it is an agricultural product made by real people\u2019s hands, they would come to appreciate it in a radically new way.\u201dNeedless to say, I did not walk out of that conference room thinking I would be booking a ticket to France the following month.I spent the next two weeks scrambling desperately to confirm that I hadn\u2019t bluffed this whole story into existence. I couldn\u2019t find information about the annual party anywhere. Herve\u0301 never responded to any of my emails. (French farmers don\u2019t seem to be, er, computer people.) A wine distributor confirmed that Herve\u0301 is, to be sure, a Big Deal, a (literally!) sulphur-allergic vigneron who took over his parents\u2019 estate and switched to natural winemaking at the turn of the millennium (i.e., before it was cool), and that the Villemade family\u2019s generosity is well-known. Finally, a few days before my flight, Herve\u0301\u2019s U.S. importer communicated that I was coming, and Herve\u0301 communicated that that was fine. And I flew to France just to go to a party\u2014and, I hoped, learn about the real people behind all that pe\u0301t-nat.Illustration by Edward SteedFast-forward through our two-and-a-half-hour drive south from Paris and its graying late-autumn landscape, past Yellow Vest protesters burning pallets at roundabouts, to the tiny town of Chitenay. We checked in at our comically quaint country inn, where we were greeted by a stack of glossy four-by-eight-inch flyers with a photo of purple-black grape clusters overlaid with white lettering. \u201cPORTES OUVERTES Chez Herve\u0301 VILLEMADE,\u201d it read, and underneath, \u201c8/9 De\u0301cembre 2018. De\u0301gustation- Vente 11h>18h.\u201dOur hotel was close to Herve\u0301\u2019s vineyard, a straight shot down a narrow country road flanked with towering trees, and we rolled up to what I understood to be the pre-party at 6:30 p.m. sharp to find a dozen or so mostly middle-aged winemakers slurping wine and shucking fat emerald-tinged Brittany oysters. I spotted Herve\u0301 right away. Sturdy, almost boyish looking despite his salt-and-pepper hair, he greeted me warmly with a handshake and a smile. And then...we stood there in a circle with some other guys while a conversation in French took place that I assume had something to do with my inexplicable presence.I quickly came to understand two things. First: It wasn\u2019t that Herve\u0301 didn\u2019t speak English, it\u2019s just that he took no real pleasure in it. It seemed to fatigue him in the way that highly competent people are fatigued by activities they aren\u2019t all that good at. He was not going to walk me through the particulars of his winemaking philosophy or practice\u2014which was just as well, honestly, because my own grasp of that stuff in English is shaky at best. Second: It wasn\u2019t that Herve\u0301 didn\u2019t want me there, but he also didn\u2019t exactly care in a special way either. This weekend, and especially this small pre-party gathering, was an opportunity for him to show hospitality to comrades and friends who weren\u2019t merely consumers of wine; they were wine. I would experience the same abundant generosity that he showed all of his people, but there would be no dog and pony show for the American writer promising to write a Big Story for a Food Magazine. Publicity was not a means to greater interconnectedness with his community, and as such was pretty much beside the point.A tasting glass was thrust into my hand, and I followed Herve\u0301 and the gaggle of winemakers as they wound their way through rooms filled with towering tanks and barrels, sampling his wines in various stages of fermentation and finesse\u2014cloudy, barely sweet whites working their way toward crispness; princess-pink, just-pressed reds that tasted like cherry kombucha. I nodded along, smiling, while the squad, I could only assume, asked technical questions and compared notes.This gave me ample time to gaze around the room at the blown-up freshly wheat-pasted photographs that covered the walls\u2014images of bearded mop-wielding young men emerging giddily from what appeared to be the now-full tanks around us, portraits of dreadlocked women hauling bins full of grapes. I recognized two of the women from the photos, 20-somethings with leg warmers and knitted beanies, standing outside shucking oysters and approached them timidly.Illustration by Edward SteedI was relieved to find that Nou Nou and Mari, my new Party Friends, did, in fact, speak English. As we rolled cigarettes and slurped oysters, they explained that they had worked the harvest with Herve\u0301. Winemaking is a year-round activity\u2014there is always something to be done, be it bottling, shipping, pruning vines\u2014but the harvest, from late summer to early fall, is an all-hands-on-deck frenzy. When the grapes are ripe for picking and pressing, it\u2019s a race against time, and crews of workers camp out, sharing long days of work and long nights of partying. They seemed summer-camp-bonded with this place and each other. They had slept on this ground, eaten and drank together, lived by the rhythms of the grapes and the seasons. And we were here, after the dust had settled and the leaves had changed and everything had calmed, enjoying the fruits of their labor, together.More people showed up; more snacks were carted out. Wide ceramic troughs of homemade country pork pa\u0302te\u0301 and rough, aspic-jiggly headcheese, wheels of crusty brown bread, fat links of saucisson sec, more oysters. The standing tables outside gradually filled with bottles in various states of open and emptiness, some of whose labels I recognized and some without labels at all. Then, at around 10 p.m., Herve\u0301 stood on a chair, announced something in French, and the now-two dozen or so revelers all filtered out into the parking lot to their cars, apparently to go to dinner. Wary of a DWI in a foreign country and with a long day ahead of us, our photographer, Jimmy, and I made our way to bed.\u201cWhere did you go last night?!\u201d Nou Nou called to us from behind a long folding table on one side of the garage that was now stacked high with oysters trucked in from the coast. They had been out, by her hazy account, until 3 a.m. at least. It was 11 a.m., and last night\u2019s revelers were arrayed across one of the large rooms, stationed at barrels, pouring (and drinking) wine from their respective properties for the early crowd. \u201cWe are a little, how you say, gueule de bois,\u201d she said, crossing her eyes and knocking performatively on her head with a fist. \u201cEr...hungover?\u201d I offered delicately. \u201cOui! Oui!\u201d she exclaimed.Illustration by Edward SteedBy noon the party was in full effect. Some people arrived in campers, in it for the long haul; some came in minivans, entered the tasting room with handcarts, and left with an axle-straining number of cases of wine. I made the rounds, edging my glass in between bodies to sample whatever each of the winemakers was pouring. There were 18 in all, small-scale vignerons from across the country whose names I recognized from the bottle lists of the kinds of natural-wine-obsessed restaurants I frequented back home. Breton. Mosse. Descombes. Binner. My notes started to make less and less sense, and I walked to the adjacent room lined with tables and benches where Herve\u0301\u2019s family had set out a seemingly never-ending buffet. Pa\u0302te\u0301 en crou\u0302te. Carrot rape\u0301. Celery root remoulade. One million funky, moldy, sweating disks of cheese and links of saucisson. If the wine on offer represented the vanguard, what\u2019s happening right now, the food was classique. A band started playing and the echoey metal room reached a fever pitch loud enough to drown out the sound of shattering glasses. A duo of kids who couldn\u2019t have been older than 12 set up deep fryers and started selling pommes frites outside, the Gallic answer to the suburban lemonade stand. It was 2 p.m.I made a new friend: Laurent Saillard, a local winemaker who spent decades in New York restaurants before moving to the Loire. Laurent became our default ambassador and hype man, introducing us around and whispering something in people\u2019s ears that made them somewhat more interested in our presence. He graciously answered my questions about who was who and what was what. The scruffy Pig Pen\u2013looking duo selling murky-looking unlabeled cider in a corner? \u201cHippies. Anarchists. They work the harvest, party hard but work harder. Get up drunk and work, work, work.\u201d The fratty-looking men in puffy vests? \u201cUgh. Beaujolais. They\u2019re fascists, but they have the best f*#%ing terroir, it\u2019s not fair.\u201dThere was a palpable shift in the party\u2019s energy around 5 p.m., when the winemakers gave up any pretense of conducting formal tastings and began to abandon their stations, leaving bottles open on their respective barrels, and repaired to the outdoors with cigarettes and full glasses in hand. That\u2019s when the wheels really came off; the tasting room was now self-service. The vibe grew louder, drunker, rowdier.As things got looser I started making inroads with the younger crowd, the millennial sons and daughters of winemakers who were getting ready to take the reins from their parents. Joseph Mosse, the son of Agne\u0300s and Rene\u0301 Mosse, who poured splashes of his herbaceous prototype vermouth into my glass of pe\u0301t-nat rose\u0301. I met He\u0301loi\u0308se Lienhardt, who along with her brother Antoine took over the family winemaking operation in Burgundy. She feigned polite interest in my spiel about this story until I got to the \u201cLike, I just want Americans to know that wine is made by farmers\u201d bit, at which point she became so animated that she nearly spilled her wine. \u201cExactly! This is what they need to know! What we are doing is different.\u201d For the next generation, this way of making wine is more than a vocation; it is a cult, a movement.Illustration by Edward SteedOver the next few hours, day-trippers began filtering out to their cars. The lights in the now-empty tasting room were turned down, middle school dance style. A long table was suddenly full of gigantic platters of oysters, magnums and jeroboams of wine\u2014the Good Stuff, bottles that had been brought and saved for this day-end moment of ebullient fraternity. Then, at nearly 11 p.m.: dinner. Couscous and mild, tender braised lamb. Slow-simmered wedges of ochre pumpkin and cabbage and buttery potatoes. Chickpeas mixed with a sweet-savory onion jam. Herve\u0301 stood at the front of the room, smiling, watching the tipsy crowd work through the buffet line and find seats at wooden banquet tables. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have to do this, you know,\u201d a wistful Laurent remarked, surveying the scene. \u201cHerve\u0301 is special.\u201dSpecial. That echoed in my half-drunk head. It all felt special. Special to be with the generous people who sweated over this wine and wanted to share it with me, with the world. Special just to know that this existed. That because I knew this I didn\u2019t need to worry about the jargon and the grape names and appellations and all the B.S. that makes wine feel so intimidating and impossible sometimes. I could choose to drink wine made by people because I like people. This\u2014this humanity behind the bottles\u2014was reason enough.I snapped out of my reverie and noticed a somewhat agitated-looking Herve\u0301 a few feet away from me, one hand clutching a bottle and the other shielding his eyes from our photographer\u2019s flash. I asked Laurent what he was saying. \u201cEr...\u201d he started delicately, \u201cHe says he\u2019s starting to get sick of the f*#%ing cameras.\u201d I looked at our photographer. It was time for us to leave.Illustration by Edward SteedAfter saying good night, I stood in my room for an anxious five minutes before deciding that I had to go back. I\u2019m the kind of person who cannot sleep knowing that the party might still have legs, and since the innkeeper had given us a grave warning earlier about cops on the road, I would have to walk. It was cold and drizzly and almost 2 a.m. I was freaked out in that very foreign-seeming darkness, walking the medieval-spooky road that separated the hotel from Herve\u0301\u2019s place, cursing my FOMO and convincing myself that I was going to arrive to find the building dark, quiet, and empty.The rain stopped and the clouds broke just as I reached the edge of the vineyard. Winding my way through the lovingly trellised vines, I finally reached a ridge overlooking Herve\u0301\u2019s complex. The lights were still very much on. I stood perfectly still for a moment, listening. From the garage I suddenly heard a wolf howl...and then a bass line. \u201cIt\u2019s after miiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiidniiiight\u201d\u2014the opening lines of \u201cThriller\u201d rang loud and clear.I was glad I came.Explore Bon App\u00e9titnatural wineWineFranceRead MorecultureHow a Wine Shop Helped Me Make Peace With My AgeBy Liz RiggscultureThe Maine Wine Shop That Makes Going Home Even BetterBy Bryan FountainLifestyleYou're Not Going to Believe I'm Saying This, But Merlot Is BackBy Marissa A.
