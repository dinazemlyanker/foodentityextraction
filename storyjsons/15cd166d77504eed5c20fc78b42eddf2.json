Go for the crudo, a unique bar program with equal parts spritzes and tiki cocktails, and, oh yeah\u2014pasta.ORDER THE: hand-pulled mozzarella and buttery aged prosciutto, and ask for the grilled bread used for crostini on the side. Sample the chef\u2019s tasting of 11 rotating crudos, from beautiful razor clams with chili and mint to striped jack with a horseradish-caviar-chive topping. Then share an antipasti, like an Italian wedge with speck or grilled octopus with potato and olives. But save room for all the pasta you can handle: handmade options like peppery bucatini carbonara, snail-shaped lumache with brown butter-saut\u00e9ed mushrooms and house-cured bacon, and biiiig tubes of paccheri with lobster, scallions, and tomato.Beverage pairings are available for $30 to let the bar team guide you with a selection of wines or\u2014surprise!\u2014tiki cocktails. Yep, that means Smoothie Moves (avocado-infused vodka, kale, lime, and a spicy breadcrumb rim to mimic avocado toast) or Three Men in a Tub (blueberry basil shrub, cachaca, white rum, lime, and eucalyptus). Sounds cheesy, but just go with it.Photo by Brian SamuelsTHE VIBE IS: completely different at the bustling bar, where you could see yourself at on a random Tuesday night just for mozzarella and Mai Tais. The spacious, blue-hued dining room is where to take your parents.PRACTICAL STUFF: Reservations available via OpenTable or by phone at 617-530-1770.
