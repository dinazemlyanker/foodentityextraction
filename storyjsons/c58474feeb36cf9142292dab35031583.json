These days, we\u2019re privy to a range of balms, oils, supplements, and infused foods that can seamlessly integrate cannabis into our lives. So, naturally, when I came across Cordial Organics\u2019 CBD tincture \u201cBalance\u201d in a luxury cannabis subscription box, I was intrigued. How much relaxation could be had without the typical weed high, I wondered, as I took the recommended one\u2014okay, a few more drops than one, I\u2019m bad at moderation\u2014under the tongue.Because this isn\u2019t my first time at the cannabis-infused rodeo, I braced myself for a foul taste similar to that of a hash brownie or THC tincture, but it never came. As the bottle promises, my tongue was met with mint, a hint of lemon, and nothing more. This was a pleasant surprise, and it turned out to be a big plus when it came to adding the blend to tea, coffee, and smoothies\u2014the flavor completely blended in.In about 20 minutes, I started feeling the effects. Hmm, placebo? Nope! Though initially I had my doubts. There wasn\u2019t a giant \u201cWoah, I\u2019m feeling it\u201d moment, I just suddenly felt up to doing things that I typically wouldn\u2019t: Like taking an afternoon snooze (I\u2019ve never been a nap person), which ended up being the best rest I\u2019d had all week. Then, the surprising part: When I woke up, I knocked out housework I usually had to coax myself into doing after avoiding it for days.Everything about the experience was enjoyably subtle. While a THC high would creep up and transport me to a hazy state, leaving me brimming with fits of laughter, deep thought, and munchies, the CBD offered something new. It dissolved tension in my body and distributed a tranquility perfect for a productive day at the office, doing errands, or relaxing at home.Cordial Organics was founded by Desi McKinnon, a graphic designer with a passion for herbalism, and Shelly Phegley, a business manager and mother of three who authored The Book of Questions for New Parents. What the company gets right, beyond its effective products and clean #aesthetic, is the community they\u2019ve created for people to learn and experiment without the stoner culture stereotype attached. They have carved out a space via their blog for customers to better understand the workings of CBD, from recipes to a primer on how cannabinoids impact mood, appetite, sleep, and immune function. And if this tincture ($48) isn\u2019t your jam, the San Diego-based company also offers CBD facial oils, lip balms, rose and lavender hydrosols, bath salts, and herbal tinctures for pets(!) through their website.For those who find it difficult to intentionally relax\u2014my fellow kin who love soothing self-care rituals in theory but struggle with it in practice; those who carry an unreasonable amount of tension in their neck and back from stress; and those whose bodies feel worn down from being overly active or intensely inactive over the years\u2014the tincture is a good product to have in your wellness arsenal. It\u2019s likely what you\u2019ll grab on a random day, or even daily, when you\u2019re looking to decompress with a clear head and ample energy. [Jenna from Lady Bird voice] Let\u2019s CBD it up!Okay, before we all go ahead and CBD it up, consider consulting a medical practitioner and double-checking marijuana prohibition in your area. While CBD products are generally not known to produce negative side effects, everyone\u2019s experience is unique.
