MorrisFacebookTwitterEmailThis is part of our series that celebrates America\u2019s Favorite Neighborhood Restaurants. We asked 80 of the most interesting people we know to reveal the local spots they love the most.Butter Cream Bakery is a pink-and-white-striped beacon of sugar and caffeine on a four-lane strip in the heart of Napa, California. Inside you\u2019ll find glass cases crammed with apricot danishes, pink-glazed doughnuts, and birthday cakes glowing with artificial color, all baked in-house. If you\u2019re in the mood for something more substantial, Butter Cream is also the city\u2019s only real diner and has been slinging perfect eggs, hash browns, and tea in small pink plastic pots since the 1940s.While the phrase \u201cNapa dining\u201d conjures images of supple summer produce, local cheese, and carefully curated wine pairings, when I was growing up there in the \u201980s, our meals weren\u2019t quite so glamorous. Sure, our tomatoes were always red, and our golden hills were always gorgeous, but back then the town looked a lot more like Central Valley than Silicon Valley. It was pickup trucks with NRA bumper stickers not Teslas with vanity plates.Not what you would expect in Napa.\nPhoto by Emma K. MorrisAs a teenager I sulked over Nirvana songs at Napa High and plotted my escape to the city, really any city, eventually landing in New York. Two things comforted me there in my early uncomfortable years as a displaced Californian: quiet walks through the American Museum of Natural History and solo dates at a diner on the Upper West Side. I\u2019m not the first to say that diners are a balm for loneliness. They aren\u2019t homes away from home; they\u2019re something better: reliably comforting places where a cross section of patrons sit alone together, bonding over their need for caffeine and carbs. Whether you\u2019ve just picked grapes for 10 hours or pulled an all-nighter in the Columbia library, nothing will cure you like a grilled cheese and a side of fries.I started to look for diners everywhere I traveled and found Butter Cream, again, after years of overlooking it on visits home. Here were the same ball-capped dudes eating alone at the counter, probably occupying the same seats since \u201986. Here were the doughnuts glazed in maple icing so sweet it hurt my teeth (in a good way). I settled in over eggs and bacon and introduced my son to the joy of bear claws and jam-filled scones.The kind of place where you always want to be.\nPhoto by Emma K. MorrisButter Cream has kept its candy stripes, but Napa has changed, of course. Its once-sleepy downtown is now a strip of luxe hotels and high-heeled tourists clad in fur vests, who\u2019ve become more visible as Napa\u2019s working- and middle-class residents trickle out to more affordable towns. Gentrification has made its mark, but the city has evolved for the better too: My high school\u2019s Native American mascot was retired recently after years of public outcry. Though I\u2019ve been long gone, I feel a little misty-eyed pride with every step forward the city takes.Despite its transformation from a backwater to a bachelorette destination, Napa holds on to the best of its old-school treasures. It\u2019s a city that refuses to fully participate in any bright, shiny future that doesn\u2019t include sheet cake and bottomless coffee cups. I cherish this stubborn attachment to the past because it means I can return, again and again, to Butter Cream\u2019s fluorescent-lit breakfast tables.These days weekending urbanites in expensive sunglasses wait for tables alongside locals with whining kids. I stand with them, somewhere in-between I guess, hoping Napa continues to save a space for each of us.Kira Garcia is a writer based in New York.ContentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Explore Bon App\u00e9titNeighborhood RestaurantsNapaRead MoresponsoredTaking the Leap for Organic Wine in NapaBy Edward JonescultureChef Christopher Kostow Stealthily Masters Napa ValleyBy Chris YingPhotography by Peden + MunkcultureThe Silverado Pickups Are a Rockabilly Band Made Up of Napa Valley WinemakersBy Mickey RapkinRecipes you want to make.
