Essentially, you\u2019re heating oil with aromatics\u2014spices, herbs, chile flakes, citrus, alliums\u2014so that both the oil and the aromatics benefit. The heat from the oil brings out the flavors of the ingredients (maybe you\u2019ve seen this step referred to as \u201cblooming\u201d or \u201ctempering\u201d) and makes them crackle and crisp. In turn, those ingredients imbue the oil with their flavor. You scratch my back, I\u2019ll scratch yours.Strain out the crispy bits from the hot oil so that they stay crunchy.\nPHOTO BY CHELSIE CRAIG, FOOD STYLING BY YEKATERINA BOYTSOVAWhat you get is a powerful oil with lots of crunchy bits, perfect for drizzling on ricotta or hummus, toast or fried eggs, seared tofu or slow-roasted fish, steamed sweet potatoes or fried rice.Using hot oil to relay the flavor of spices to the oil itself is a technique practiced across cuisines: In her book Indian-ish Priya Krishna calls chhonk (a.k.a. tadka), where spices are sizzled in oil, then poured over dal or sabzi, \u201cthe greatest Indian cooking technique ever.\u201d And you\u2019ll find versions of chili oil, which can be as simple as heating chile flakes in oil, or loaded with ginger, garlic, cinnamon and star anise, at Sichuanese restaurants and ramen shops.I\u2019ve long wondered how Andy Baraghani makes his recipes so much more delicious than seems fair. Turns out, infused oil is the answer. The first step in his Garlickiest Fried Rice is to fry sliced garlic in oil, then remove those golden slivers and use that infused oil to cook the rice. For his Risi e Bisi, he makes a scallion oil, then garnishes the finished product with the crisped-up scallions slices and a drizzle of the onion-y oil. And his Steak Short Ribs are served with a quickie garlic-chile oil. Andy is teaching by example and yes, we get the idea!Dive in!\nPHOTO BY CHELSIE CRAIG, FOOD STYLING BY YEKATERINA BOYTSOVASo for this Lentil Salad, we took his cue: You\u2019ll heat olive oil with garlic, scallions, and lemon zest before adding almonds, which fry in the heat, and, at the last moment, red pepper flakes and cumin seeds (since spices are sensitive and prone to burn, they go in last). Strain the oil so that the aromatics stay crisp\u2014they\u2019ll add delightful texture to the salad\u2014then use that oil as the base of a vinaigrette. The flavor of the cooked-out alliums and lemon peel is simultaneously less harsh and more complex than if you had you added them raw. Plus, the oil gets evenly distributed over the lentils, making sure all bites are good bites.Grab a skillet, your favorite spice, and your favorite allium. Infuse some oil the next time you\u2019re making a salad dressing or just looking to amp up roasted cauliflower. Sometimes I\u2019ll infuse oil, pull out the aromatics, then use that oil to saut\u00e9 chickpeas. And just like that, no one can tell that dinner came from a can.Get the recipe:Just-Keeps-Getting-Better Lentil SaladHere\u2019s the answer to your question: \u201cWhat can I make on Sunday night that will taste great for my 10:30 a.m. desk lunch on Wednesday?\u201dView RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titOlive OilRecipes you want to make.
