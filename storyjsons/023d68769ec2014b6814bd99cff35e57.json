They take scallions, onion, Napa cabbage, carrots, and sugar snap peas; slice the vegetables thinly (so they cook evenly); then batter and fry them until the bhajia are golden brown. \u201cI can\u2019t think of any food that screams Indian party food more than hot crispy bhajia,\u201d they say.A few tips: Don\u2019t skip the baking powder in the batter! This keeps the bhajia light, even as they start to cool off. To avoid making a soupy mess, add the flour mixture to the veg in batches, instead of dipping the veg into a wet batter. Resist the temptation to form the bhajia batter into balls, Mistry advises. Keeping the batter in flat disks lets more surface area come into contact with the hot oil, giving the fritters lots of sharp, pokey edges and crispy bits.Find more of chef Preeti Mistry\u2019s Holi party recipes here.Ingredients8 ServingsVegetables2bunches scallions, white and pale green parts only, thinly sliced lengthwise into 1\u00bd\" pieces1medium onion, thinly sliced2cups thinly sliced Napa cabbage2carrots, thinly sliced lengthwise into 1\u00bd\" pieces1cup thinly sliced sugar snap peas2Tbsp. ground coriander2Tbsp. red chili powder1Tbsp. ground cuminKosher saltAssemblyVegetable oil (for frying; about 8 cups)2cups chickpea flour\u2154cup rice flour3tsp. baking powder2tsp.
