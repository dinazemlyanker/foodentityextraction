Only had around 12 sage leaves but would use at least 20 next time as the flavor was too faint but delicious. Added zest of 1 lemon at the end, and as others have mentioned, lots of black pepper. Easy and excellent!Charleston, SC11/5/2020I pretty much love any dish where I can incorporate prosciutto!

Thanks BA! \nIrishkateChicago5/31/2020\nAnonymous5/25/2020So good! One of the two pastas my pasta-hating fianc\u00e9 admits to liking. Even better the next day. AnonymousWashington, DC4/25/2020Omg this was good and so quick and easy. It\u2019s my new quick throw together dinner. Since I\u2019m from New Mexico I added some red chiliAlbuquerque 4/7/2020This has to be said with a Boston accent...\nThis recipe is a keepa..\nI added the juice of half a lemon\nI did not use sage as I did not have any.\nI used about 4 leaves of fresh basil\nEasy and yummy and who needs to consider calories\nBoston4/5/2020Delicious - we added chopped asparagus and added them in the step with peas, cut the recipe in half for two - perfect portions.  Good quality cheese is important, and lots of black pepper was a needed addition.szmarie70354/2/2020This recipe was soooo easy and sooo good. Re-reading it now, I realize that I forgot to slice the Proscuitto and just tore it into pieces and threw it into the butter...oh, well. Still great. This pasta is flavorful, comforting, and has a vegetable in it so it's healthy, right?AnonymousLos Angeles3/31/2020My wife and I found this recipe to be very disappointing and bland. After dinner, my wife made a separate cream sauce for the leftovers:). I would not recommend it..Larry FeigenbaumCA3/31/2020This came out sooo good!! I halved the recipe but kept 16 sage leaves. YUM! AnonymousIllinois3/29/2020This was delicious! Anonymous3/29/2020So good! I didn't have enough prosciutto on hand and had to use some bacon as well, which made it extra fatty, but it was still crazy delicious. I even foraged for the sage, because I'm on lock down and I. Will. Survive. I made fresh pasta which bright it to an 11.
