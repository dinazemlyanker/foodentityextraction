Today: How to make oat milk.When I moved in with three women a year ago, I joked that we were the Queens of Alt Milk. Open our fridge on any day and you\u2019d see at least four cartons of nondairy beverages, from classic soy to protein-packed cashew milk. It wasn\u2019t long, however, until we all converged on the holy grail of milk alternatives: oat milk.My younger sister introduced me to the beverage, texting one afternoon: \u201cOk have you had oat milk,\u201d immediately followed by, \u201cIt\u2019s so good. It tastes like heavy cream.\u201dI bought a carton the next day. Her evaluation was on the mark: Oat milk\u2019s texture is creamy and luxurious, its flavor neutral, just barely sweet. I\u2019m a self-identified culinary experimentalist with a taste for rich dairy products (smooth chocolate milk laced with heavy cream, dreamy ricotta swooped on tomato-topped toast, lavish layers of mascarpone blanketing coffee-soaked ladyfingers), but I\u2019m also a vegetarian on the lookout to reduce my carbon footprint. I saw oat milk as a more sustainable choice\u2014among the plant-based milks, it requires less land and water in production and creates minimal carbon emissions. It became my perfect dairy alternative\u2014streamed into coffee, subbed while baking, drenching my morning oatmeal (oh, the absurdity of my breakfast oats luxuriating in a bath of their brethren).Once the pandemic began, I limited my grocery trips and made the kitchen my oat milk production zone. Commercial oat milk contains added thickeners and stabilizers, but I scoured the web and tinkered with my recipe to achieve creamy homemade oat milk sans sliminess.Oat milk starts with ice-cold water (any heat risks cooking the oats, ruining the texture). For 4 cups oat milk, combine 1 cup dry rolled oats (I used Bob\u2019s Red Mill, but any rolled oats will work\u2014don\u2019t use instant or quick-cooking oats), 4 cups cold water, and a pinch of salt and blend for 20 seconds max. Don\u2019t soak the oats beforehand or overblend them\u2014that causes starch breakdown, upping the slime factor. I don\u2019t have a high-speed blender, just an old Osterizer passed down from my mom. If you bought your blender after the \u201980s, I would advise blending for less time, just 10\u201315 seconds.Next, strain through a clean T-shirt (a nut milk bag will allow too much sediment through) into your storage receptacle of choice. You can gently nudge the oat mixture through the cloth with the back of a spoon, but don\u2019t push too hard or squeeze the leftover pulp, which contains the gluey starch compounds (although you can add the pulp to oatmeal or cookies if you wish).While I never found this basic recipe slimy, it wasn\u2019t as creamy as I had hoped. So, in my quarantine-allotted free time, I dove into a whirlwind of blender-supported recipe research and Osterized my way through an array of creamy additions. The Alt Milk Queens of my apartment obligingly closed their eyes and tasted the results.First, I added 1 teaspoon canola oil (any neutral oil would work) to the blender with the oats and water. Everyone found this less grainy than the original recipe, but not yet velvety.Next, instead of the oil, I tried adding \u00bc cup nuts (soaked overnight), blending them with 2 cups water for 30 seconds, then adding the remaining 2 cups water along with 1 cup dry oats and a pinch of salt. I blended the full mixture for 20 more seconds and strained.Here was the creaminess we\u2019d been missing! I tested three separate nut combinations: \u00bc cup macadamias, \u00bc cup cashews, and a 50-50 combo. My patient oat milk\u2014adoring roommates dutifully sipped from their testing glasses and tried each combination. In a blind test, the winner in both taste and texture was half cashews\u2013half macadamia nuts\u2014silky and rich, yet not nutty tasting. I suspect another nut or combination (Brazil, hazelnut, pecan, you name it!) would also work deliciously.Store your oat milk in the fridge for up to five days, and give it a vigorous shake before drinking or using it to cook or bake as some separation is inevitable (but sliminess doesn\u2019t have to be). With a whirl of our blender, these Alt Milk Queens dub you Oat Milk Royalty. We recommend you sip from a chalice while wearing a crown.Kate Raphael is a writer based in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
