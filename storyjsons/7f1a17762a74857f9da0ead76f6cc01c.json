This one is inspired by a version found in San Luis Potos\u00ed in central Mexico with potatoes and poblanos. All you need are some fresh flour tortillas and you\u2019ve got dinner, and any leftovers will make for an excellent breakfast taco the next day.\u201dIngredients4 Servings2Tbsp. vegetable oil, divided1lb. ground beef chuck (20% fat)\u00bdmedium onion, finely chopped2plum tomatoes, cored, chopped1medium poblano chile, seeds removed, finely chopped3garlic cloves, finely grated1tsp. ground cumin\u00bdtsp. freshly ground black pepper1Tbsp.

My mother made it slightly differently, comino seeds with garlic, otherwise very similiar. SRTexas11/15/2021Love, love, love. This is the ultimate comfort food. I always use 2 poblanos and 2 potatoes, and add a Serrano pepper for heat. The chicken broth/stock you use will really change the salt content, so I start off with 1 tsp. This is such a simple and delicious recipe.AnonymousSan Francisco 7/21/2021Delicious dish but agree that modifications need to be made (less salt, less broth)JSChicago, IL4/19/2021Delicious and will make again! I was inspired by others' comments to make some tweaks -- added a tsp of cumin seeds at the start to the oil to deepen cumin flavor, added olives to the onion, tomato, pepper mixture, stirred in a Tbsp of tomato paste before adding back the beef , cut salt to half, used 1.5 cups of broth, while keeping other ingredients as listed. Like other reviewers commented, the recipe directions do not lead to a dish that looks like the photo (tomatoes will be cooked down, onion and pepper will be more finely chopped). Served with tortillas and sour cream. My family loved it! AnonymousNew York, NY2/28/2021DELICIOUS! It's rare that something so simple can be so life altering. Bumped up the poblanos and added an extra potato, plus some serrano but no other adjustments. It was perfect. Tacos don't feel right when its cold outside, but this does. So comforting and nourishing. Anonymous1/24/2021We thought this was great, if a little greasy.  Made some home made Sonoran tortillas to go with it.  I'm excited about leaving the leftovers in the fridge and seeing if there's a layer of grease to scrape off. Flavor was amazing though.Aja San Diegan in Austin, TX1/22/2021This is a great, versatile recipe. I have made it a few times -- as directed and modified with whatever I had on hand. Poblanos really add nice depth.Mark in PDXPortland, OR1/18/2021Easy, filling, but I felt it needed some tweaks. Double the cumin, poblano, onion and garlic. Added 2 tbls of tomato paste. Like others, cut back on the salt. Finished the dish with fresh lime juice.LynnWoodbury, CT11/20/2020I'm not vegetarian but made this with impossible beef ground round. Absolutely amazing. Highly recommended. AnonymousToronto10/13/2020This is really delicious! I would definitely dial back the salt, especially if you're using a storebought stock/broth that contains salt. I used 1 tsp of Morton and thought that was plenty. Like others, I had a lot of broth left after the potatoes were tender, so I just cranked the heat for about a five minutes to evaporate off the liquid. Goes very nicely with sour cream.AnonymousNew York10/8/2020I've made this twice and it came out great both times. However I did learn some things: using my larger cast iron pan over my non stick ceramic helped a lot with the time needed to reduce the broth. The first time when it says to simmer for 20-25 mins I lowered the heat, and ended up having quite a bit of broth left after 25 mins. Between keeping heat up and larger pan it fully evaporated the broth in 25 mins.  The first time I just let it simmer longer (25 more minutes) and it came out great as well.Michigan10/6/2020Made this pretty much as written though I simmered it for a little while longer to reduce the liquid. Served on flour tortillas with sour cream. It was very tasty.Anonymous9/30/2020Great flavor, and super easy to prepare on a weeknight!  The measurements for broth and salt were way too much, though.  I ended up pouring off a good deal of liquid after 25 minutes.  Next time, 1/2 cup of broth will be plenty, and I'll season with salt as I go.Anonymous9/25/2020This was pretty good. I used ground chicken due to a mix up at the grocery store (my fault). It was good. Served with rice and tortillas. Added jalape\u00f1o. I had to cook it for closer to 30 minutes for the potatoes to cook through and the liquid to evaporate. kagagnon10California9/21/2020DELICIOUS!!!  I added a chopped jalopeno, 2 tbsp chili powder, and a 3rd tomato, and served with rice, a cucumber-onion salad, and corn tortillas. Wow.
