Like, who wants to be confronted with the number of times they listened to that earwormy Bieber and Chance the Rapper song or to know that their most-streamed album was not some obscure banger but \u201cRelaxing Whale Calls for Stress Relief Vol. 3\u201d? It shows us an image of ourselves that\u2019s a little too crisp.This list is sort of like that. Throughout 2020 we shared with you some of the kitchen accessories, appliances, and tools we loved the most. The things you loved most? It wasn\u2019t the festive cake stand-slash-punch bowl or the set of lovely French steak knives\u2014it was jigsaw puzzles and steel wool. Yeah, 2020 was like that. Here\u2019s to a brighter 2021.K\u00fcchenprofi Tweezer TongsIn January we ran this piece about the only tongs you\u2019ll ever need, but in August contributor Sohla El-Waylly shook things up by coming out hard in favor of tweezer tongs. In the battle of the tongs, the readers have spoken! Sohla\u2019s sturdy 12-inch tweezers were a runaway hit, proving there\u2019s no right or wrong tong.K\u00fcchenprofi 12-Inch Stainless Steel Tweezer Tongs$13 $12 at Amazon$20 at WayfairOxo Baker's Dusting WandAccording to a wild guess I\u2019m making, the average BA reader made 29 loaves of bread this year. We gave the people what they wanted, and in October we surveyed our panel of bread experts about the tools they use to turn out perfect loaves each time. Out of all their recommendations, from bannetons to serrated knives, there was one product you loved the most\u2014and it was something of a wild card. Claire Saffitz swears by this dusting wand to keep her loaves and work surfaces well-floured. \u201cIt offers a ton of control, so I don\u2019t have flour flying everywhere,\u201d she says. It\u2019s also perfect for sprinkling powdered sugar and ground spices like cinnamon exactly where you want and nowhere you don\u2019t.Oxo Baker\u2019s Dusting Wand$10 at OXO$15 at AmazonOur Place Always PanHealthyish writer Ali Francis raved about the limited-edition Always Pan that Our Place released for Lunar New Year, which featured a bonus bamboo steamer and a cherry red finish. Even though that special release came and went, the classic nonstick Always Pan with its nesting wooden spatula and drop-in metal steamer basket was a BA reader favorite throughout 2020.Photo by Emma FishmanAlways Pan$145 at Our PlaceFive Two Bamboo Cutting Board\u00a0I crack open the cookbooks on special occasions, but usually if I\u2019m looking up a recipe it\u2019s on my phone. Maybe you can relate because you seemed to share former staffer Emma Wartzman\u2019s passion for this bamboo cutting board. It has a notch to keep your phone upright, so you can easily consult a recipe, catch up on your stories, or FaceTime with Emma\u2019s mom while you cook.Laura MurrayFive Two Bamboo Cutting Board$59 at Food52Material reBoard Cutting BoardPerhaps you heeded our advice that you actually need two cutting boards\u2014a big wooden one for almost everything and a sterilizable plastic one for raw meat and seafood\u2014because you also fell for these cutting boards made from recycled plastic and renewable sugarcane. Since we originally featured them in Healthyish, Material has launched two new colors benefitting nonprofits Heart of Dinner and Drive Change. Fifty percent of the proceeds from the pale peach To P\u00f3-Po with Love and the emerald green Reimagine Justice reBoards will be split between the two organizations.Material reBoard Cutting Board$35 at MaterialFat Daddio\u2019s Round Cake PanMaybe it was because of this groovy cheesecake cake from Sohla or this multilayered sweet potato cake from Baltimore baker Amanda Mack, but y\u2019all baked a lot of cakes this year. Or at least you bought a lot of cake pans\u2014specifically this Fat Daddio\u2019s round cake pan, which Basically proclaimed best-in-class.Photo by Laura MurrayFat Daddio's Round Cake Pan, 9 x 3 Inch$14 at AmazonCalzuro ClogsI have a closet full of non-sensible shoes, and although sometimes I like to put on my pink pony hair mules and clomp around just for the hell of it, for the most part I\u2019ve been wearing comfy slip-ons for the past nine months. Staff writer Alex Beggs couldn\u2019t have known she was recommending the ideal COVID house shoe back in February when she wrote about these cushy Italian plastic clogs, but in doing so she has cemented her reputation as the oracle of Bon App\u00e9tit. Don\u2019t sleep on the pink tie-dye pair.Calzuro Clogs$104 at AmazonBreville Smart OvenBaker Yossy Arefi landed on our Best Holiday Cookbooks list with her casual-cool book of Snacking Cakes, and I was shocked to learn that many of the recipes she tested for her book were baked in this powerhouse of a countertop oven. The Breville Smart Oven was good news for renters with crappy ovens when we featured it back in April, and it\u2019s even better news now that it\u2019s on deep sale.Breville Smart Oven Pro$525 $280 at Sur La Table$280 at Bloomingdales'sPiecework Forbidden Fruit PuzzleYou did puzzles. Lots of puzzles. You were especially enthusiastic about this sunny, tropical, fruity offering from Piecework that we shouted out back in April.Photo by Emma FishmanPiecework Forbidden Fruit Puzzle$36 at Piecework$36 at VerishopHomax Steel WoolThis most fave of the favorite kitchen accessories was a no-brainer. A pack of 12 pads of steel wool is $4, and you bought it because Carla said so.Laura MurraySteel Wool, 12 Pads$6 at AmazonBaker of Seville Bread LameHealthyish assistant editor Aliza Abarbanel began baking sourdough before COVID hit New York, but by July she had reached new levels of commitment to her craft. No longer satisfied with using a kitchen knife to score her boules, she bought a lame\u2014and she convinced you to buy one too.Emma FishmanBaker of Seville Bread Lame$20 at EtsyEmile Henry Fruit BowlIn March and April the BA recipe that consistently drew the most traffic was this one for four perfect baked potatoes. (Step one: Identify which appliance in your kitchen is the oven.) Whether a first-time home cook or seasoned pro in need of a refresher, you figured out what to do with all those potatoes but not where to keep them\u2014until August, when Healthyish published this piece about a ceramic storage bowl for your root veggies and fruit.Photo by Rocky Luten/Food52Emile Henry Ceramic Storage Bowl$140 at Food52Graf Lantz Merino Wool CoastersYou know how merino wool is the perfect winter base layer because it wicks moisture away from your body, keeping you both warm and dry? These coasters are like that, plus they come in so many good color combos with names like Bauhaus and Palm Springs. Your coffee table thanks you.4-Pack of Merino Wool Felt Coasters$24 at Graf LantzFellow Corvo Electric KettleI saved a lot of money on fancy coffee shop pour-overs this year. Maybe you did too since many of you snapped up this sleek matte black electric kettle from Fellow.Fellow Corvo EKG Electric Kettle$149 at Amazon$149 at FellowAarke CarbonatorDirector of editorial operations Cristina Martinez knew that buying bottles of sparkling water that had been shipped from remote mountain springs wasn\u2019t exactly eco-friendly. But she also didn\u2019t want to settle for a bulky countertop soda machine made of plastic. You apparently felt the same way because you loved the Scandi-chic Aarke Carbonator\u2014available in stainless steel, matte black, mod white, or 100 percent pure gold (not quite, but if you\u2019re giving this as a late holiday gift, no one needs to know).Carbonator II, Matte Black$220 at Williams Sonoma$219 at VerishopExplore Bon App\u00e9titproductShoppingToolsRecipes you want to make.
