Historian Paul Freedman walks us through the three phases that turned Italian food into Red Sauce.The Bohemian Phase Restaurants in major U.S. cities once fit into two categories: fancy French on the high end and dreary workingmen\u2019s hash houses on the low. Then came the 1880s, and with them a massive influx of Southern Italian immigrants. Exotic yet accessible, the restaurants they opened appealed to \u201cBohemians,\u201d the hipsters of that era. Red-and-white-checked tablecloths gave a soigne\u0301-but-informal vibe, as did candles in straw-wrapped Chianti bottles (standard in Italy to prevent the bottles from breaking, perceived as picturesque in the States). From Sodini\u2019s Green Valley in San Francisco to Dante & Luigi\u2019s in Philly, chefs developed dishes that were unknown in the old country. The higher American standard of living meant more meat, so meatballs were paired with spaghetti. Parmesan, formerly a special treat, was now lavished upon eggplant, chicken, and veal dishes.The Spectacle Phase Italian cuisine became so popular post\u2013World War I and through the 1970s that it spread beyond the artsy crowd and out to moderately affluent suburbanites. This was the era of the Italian restaurant as spectacle: Gargiulo\u2019s in Brooklyn, Miceli\u2019s in Hollywood, and Mamma Leone\u2019s in Manhattan, a palatial establishment that redefined the meaning of oversize portions (the antipasti alone consisted of a dozen plates) and where thousands of customers ate every day. Instead of the romantic ambiance of the Bohemians, the spaghetti palaces of the mid-20th century were celebratory, appealing to families and stars alike. When the entranced public blew kisses to Liberace at a table in the middle of Mamma Leone\u2019s in 1956, it nearly caused a stampede.The Regional Phase In the 1980s, as Americans became more well-traveled and developed more sophisticated palates, a third era of Italian restaurants emerged. Regional Northern Italian food replaced the Neapolitan and Sicilian cuisine of earlier immigrants. Pioneering New York restaurants like San Domenico, Da Silvano, and Lidia Bastianich\u2019s Felidia offered a more refined environment with prices to match: In place of Gonfarone\u2019s multicourse meal for 50 cents, there were white truffles, shaved over almost anything, for a $200 supplement. The prominence and prestige of this \u201cauthentic\u201d cuisine tagged the older Southern Italian types with the affectionate if dismissive term \u201cred sauce restaurants.\u201dExplore Bon App\u00e9titRed SauceRestaurantsItalian AmericanRead MorerestaurantsRed Sauce AmericaBy Bon App\u00e9titRecipes you want to make.
