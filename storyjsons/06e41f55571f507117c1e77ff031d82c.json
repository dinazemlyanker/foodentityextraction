Pro tip: If you sign up for the newsletter, you'll get the scoop before everyone else.Healthyish friends,Last week, I wrote about the emotional extremes that a lot of us have been going through. Since then, I feel like everything has changed. (Is it just me or have weeks become decades?) The virus, which we\u2019ve watched like a tsunami building off the coast, is cresting. Places like New York are already in it. Meanwhile, the adrenaline surges that got us through this first transition\u2014to WFH life, to social isolation\u2014are fizzling out, and we\u2019re hitting walls of exhaustion, grief, numbness, and malaise. I\u2019ve checked off pretty much all of the above.It feels important to name it: What we\u2019re going through is a collective, long-term trauma. Most of us have never experienced something like this first-hand. Even though I compared it to a tsunami earlier, the virus is not a natural disaster, nor is it a human-made catastrophe like 9/11. Those are acute traumas: when they happen, our fight-or-flight instincts kick in to protect us, then there\u2019s an aftermath. We process and grieve; we recover and rebuild.What\u2019s happening now is like a war. We\u2019re talking about our hospitals as \u201cthe front lines,\u201d because they are. But we\u2019re all in this war, whether you\u2019re in an ICU or on your couch. The threat is physical (the virus) and it\u2019s psychological (our fear of the virus), and it\u2019s not going away any time soon. My friend Claire sent me this episode of Bren\u00e9 Brown\u2019s podcast the other day, and in it she warns that the fear of collapse will become the actual collapse unless we change our mindsets now.But what does that look like?To be honest, I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m trying to figure out how to take care of myself and others, how to be alone right now. One thing I think will be crucial over the next weeks and months is information. Not the kind that you get at 2 a.m. in a panicked fog while scrolling Twitter. I mean the kind of rational, supportive information that friends are sharing in email and text threads, on phone calls, and, sure, on Twitter. Like that podcast episode I just mentioned, this thread from a nurse, this video from an ER doctor, and this text from a friend when I was freaking out the other day:Of course...find a place to sit quietly.\nThink of 5 things to touch\n4 things to smell\n3 things to focus on (sight)\n2 things to taste\n1 thing to hear...quiet music, spa or water soundsYou can change any of these to fit your needs best. It's all about bringing yourself back to comfort.Call me whenever you can talk.Yesterday, in the spirit of information-sharing and connection, we launched The Healthyish Guide to Being Alone. It\u2019s a month-long series meant to provide info and support (and laughs), and it\u2019s for everyone, whether you\u2019re shacked up with the in-laws or a partner or a whole lot of plants. It kicks off with a new advice column from Andy Baraghani, in which he answers a reader\u2019s question: How do I learn to live alone in the middle of a pandemic? There\u2019s also some true confessions from our staff about the Secret Single Cooking we do when no one\u2019s home. A lot more will come\u2014recipes, essays, distractions, and tips for getting through the tough time ahead.I hope you stay with us. We\u2019ll be here for you.Until next week,Amanda ShapiroHealthyish editorExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishSelf CareCoronavirusHealthyish NewsletteressayRead MoreLifestyleBliss and FearBy Amanda ShapiroRecipes you want to make.
