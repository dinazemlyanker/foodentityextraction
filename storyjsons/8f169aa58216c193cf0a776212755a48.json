You Can TooNow all you need is a steaming bowl of Malaysian chicken curry to go with it\u2026By Mehreen KarimAugust 13, 2020FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto and Food Styling by Mehreen Karim\u00a0FacebookTwitterEmailThe only thing better than a good recipe? When something\u2019s so easy to make that you don\u2019t even need one. Welcome to It\u2019s That Simple, a column where we talk you through the process of making the dishes and drinks we can make with our eyes closed.When I think of rotis, what come to mind are often round whole wheat flatbreads hailing from the Indian subcontinent. But due to British colonization and the movement, both voluntary and forced, of South Asians around the globe, rotis are found in kitchens worldwide in countless shapes and flavor profiles. Decades post-colonization, my Bangladeshi grandparents immigrated to Malaysia to practice medicine. My mom and her family spent their childhood in Malaysia, folding Malaysian culture and food into their upbringing, and eventually, into my own.In Malaysia, roti jala is deeply rooted in the cuisine. A savory crepe typically eaten alongside a fragrant Malaysian chicken curry, roti jala is Malay for \u201cnet bread,\u201d referring to the bread\u2019s delicate lace-like design. My fondest kitchen memories are of roti jala nights with my mom or choto mama (\u201cmaternal uncle\u201d), learning how to perfect its consistency and shape. Roti jala\u2019s nooks and crannies make it the ideal chicken curry companion as it catches every last drop when it\u2019s dipped into the gravy.Photo and Food Styling by Mehreen Karim\u00a0While it may look complicated to make, the batter is as simple as any crepe recipe\u2014with crucial flavor additions such as turmeric and coconut milk. It\u2019s roti jala\u2019s unique frying process and savory, aromatic flavor that set it apart. To achieve the lacy design, the batter gets poured into a bottle and drizzled onto a pan in spirals. After frying, the roti jala gets rolled up into a cigar shape that allows for easy dipping. Though this cooking method may seem daunting, my mom delegated the frying and folding task to me when I was all of 10 years old. Presuming you\u2019re older than 10, you\u2019ve got this.When I\u2019m with my choto mama and family in California, we get to use his authentic Malaysian roti jala dispenser, a ladle with five holes at its base to let batter through to produce the laciest roti jala. But when I\u2019m on the East Coast, my squeeze bottle does the trick. If you don\u2019t have a squeeze bottle, you can use a large plastic water bottle (1-liter Smartwater bottles are ideal). Heat the tip of a safety pin or knife over a flame and poke 3\u20134 holes into the bottle\u2019s cap.Here\u2019s how to make it: Whisk all of your ingredients in a large bowl: 1 cup full-fat coconut milk, 1 egg, 2\u00bd cups all-purpose flour, 2\u00bd cups water, 1 tsp. turmeric, and 1 tsp. kosher salt until there are no lumps left. This will make 20\u201330 roti jala (enough to generously feed 5 people). Using a funnel and a ladle, transfer as much of the batter as you can into your dispenser of choice.When your squeeze bottle or water bottle is ready, add 1 Tbsp. canola or vegetable oil onto a medium nonstick pan over medium heat. Using a paper towel, wipe the oil in circles around the pan, simultaneously absorbing excess oil. (Keep that oily paper towel handy in case the pan needs a new swipe between batches.) I like to squeeze a small squiggle of batter on the pan to test the heat. You\u2019ll know it\u2019s hot enough when the batter immediately lightens in color and sets after you\u2019ve drizzled it on the pan\u2019s surface.Now for the fun part! Squeeze concentric circles onto your pan, creating a net-like design that covers no more than 75% of the pan with batter.Photo and Food Styling by Mehreen Karim\u00a0While my family is a fan of the circular design above, I like to drizzle the batter in a crisscross pattern.Photo and Food Styling by Mehreen Karim\u00a0The roti jala gets fried only on one side and it takes no more than 2\u20133 minutes. You\u2019ll know it\u2019s done once you see the edges lift off the pan and it\u2019s basically asking you to transfer it to another plate. Overcooking the batter will result in a brittle roti jala that is difficult to fold and prone to breaking, so make sure to remove it as soon as you see crisp edges.While it\u2019s still warm, fold the right and left sides about 1\u20132 inches toward the center. Then starting at the bottom, roll the roti tightly toward the top of the plate, creating a cigar shape.Once you\u2019ve removed one roti jala, immediately squeeze a new one onto the pan. If you noticed the previous roti jala sticking, use the oily paper towel to swipe a bit more oil onto the pan in between batches. While each new roti jala cooks, you\u2019ll fold your previously fried roti jala into its final rolled shape. To store, refrigerate in an airtight container for up to a week. To reheat, sprinkle with water and microwave or pan-fry on low.You may find that very few kitchen moments are as satisfying as making an intricately drizzled roti jala. It\u2019s the perfect activity when you want a seemingly impressive dish on your dinner table and leftovers to last you the week. Roti jala on repeat is the meal plan we all deserve.Mehreen Karim works in global women\u2019s health and is the author of imakedthis.com, a food blog dedicated to conversational recipes that cut to the chase.Explore Bon App\u00e9titIt's That SimpleMalaysianRead MorecookingIf It's Not Spicy Enough to Make You Sweat, It's Not ChowBy Lesley EnstonRecipes you want to make.
