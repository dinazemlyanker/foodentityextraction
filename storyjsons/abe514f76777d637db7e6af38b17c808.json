This dish is basically grilled antipasto. Easy, hearty, and it can stand up to the hot weather if you make it ahead and it\u2019s sitting there on the picnic table or whatever.\u201dIngredients4\u20136 servings2lb. assorted mushrooms (such as crimini, shiitake, and/or maitake), wiped clean, trimmed, torn into big pieces if large7Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil, dividedKosher salt2Tbsp.

Great flavors. We live in rural America and couldn't find an Aleppo pepper and it was still excellent.JAHSturgeon Bay, WI7/14/2021So good. We have made it a few times already. Yum.AnonymousGlenville8/26/2020Successfully roasted these in an oven when propane tank out last minute!   Also subbed 1 lb of baby Yukon gold potatoes for mushrooms as I didn\u2019t feel like spending $50 on mushrooms!   Excellent flavor and tastes even better day after. AnonymousWarwick, NY8/5/2020This is an amazing recipe that we have served both as a salad and on grilled bread as an appetizer.  We have used multiple different kinds of mushrooms, but always a base of Cremini, Shitake and Oyster.  We've added Lion's Mane and others, but they tend to disappear.  Regardless it's a HIT!AnonymousSimsbury, Connecticut8/2/2020An excellent recipe that will hold up to bold main dishes. I grilled the mushrooms on a Traeger pellet grill and think the wood smoke added a very nice flavor! I did add a splash more of champagne vinegar to balance it out to my taste.\n\nWill definitely use as a base recipe to pivot off of!PTW90Virginia7/12/2020This was great. Try not to make it in a pan as I did bc the mushrooms will get watery. Vinaigrette spice plus parmesan with peppers - lots of flavour!mumslittlehelper6/25/2020Oh my goodness-another fabulous not-too-fussy vegetarian side dish-thank you Brad! This dish packs in all the tangy, smokey and spicy flavors that make you want to savor every bite. Perfect for an outdoor summer gathering. This, along with Brad's Miso-y Grilled Potatoes recipe has made it into my family's favorite side dishes.gpinczowKirkland, WA6/19/2020Explore Bon App\u00e9titSaladItalianEuropeanMushroomVegetableOliveOther IngredientsAleppo-Style PepperHerbs & SpicesParmesanCheeseSummerSideNut-FreeGluten-FreeVegetarianKetoHealthyishGrillingFourth Of JulyMemorial DayLabor DayDinnerRecipes you want to make.
