We asked 80 of the most interesting people we know to reveal the local spots they love the most.I don\u2019t even give Alebrije\u2019s a name when I tell people to meet me at my favorite Santa Ana, California, taco truck. \u201cJust look for the pink lonchera off Main Street,\u201d I say. \u201cYou won\u2019t miss it.\u201dThey never do.This lonchera\u2014another name for \u201cfood truck,\u201d for the uninitiated\u2014sports a glorious Pepto-Bismol-esque hue that's probably visible from Graceland, one that would make a Mary Kay top seller green with envy. But even the color-blind immediately see something rosy here. There\u2019s usually a line, Mexicans and not, and eaters scattered everywhere\u2014on the curb, on milk crates, on rickety chairs, or just standing around. Alebrije\u2019s is so popular that police officers park in the red zone right behind it and eat off the hoods of their Ford Interceptors.And this has been my public office for the past decade.Yes, my office is pink.\nPhoto by Cody JamesHere, I meet sources, hold court with friends, or conduct interviews with television networks\u2014producers from Switzerland, Mexico, and Argentina, plus NBC and even ESPN, have all stopped by. Alebrije\u2019s slogan is Coma Como en el DF\u2014\u201cEat Like in Mexico City\u201d\u2014and so I take my guests through their specialties: alambres (a bunch of meats glued together with melted cheese), mulitas (halfway between a quesadilla and a gordita), and picaditas (think sopes on steroids).They always shoot me a bewildered look when they first arrive, but I shut up skeptics for good when I order them the taco acorazado.It\u2019s a specialty of Cuernavaca, a city about an hour and a half away from Mexico City, and translates to \u201cbattleship taco\u201d in English because it\u2019s as mighty as one. Alebrije\u2019s cooks pat out a fresh corn tortilla as big as a hardcover novel and place upon it a bed of Spanish rice. That\u2019s topped with beef milanesa\u2014crunchy and buttery and glorious\u2014followed by strata of grilled onions, grilled cactus, fresh tomatoes, diced cabbage, avocado and a blizzard of cotija. Grab some habanero-spiked pickled onions from the salsa bar, spoon some green or red salsa on everything, and then we're ready to talk.THIS is lunch.\nPhoto by Cody JamesYou don\u2019t eat the taco acorazado so much as deconstruct it layer by layer, and my guests inevitably devour it with gusto. And while they do, I tell them the other reason why Alebrije\u2019s is my office: out of eternal respect.In 2006, the all-Latino Santa Ana City Council decided to enact laws that would force loncheras to move every half hour, thereby killing their business. Alebrije\u2019s decided to sue the City Council on behalf of the city\u2019s taco trucks\u2014and won. A new council tried to do the same last year\u2014this time, they also wanted to enact regulations banning scrolling marquee signs and forcing food trucks to stay at least 500 feet from elementary schools. The council modified the proposed regulations after a collective outcry from the city\u2019s 150-plus loncheros\u2014led once again by the Alebrije\u2019s crew.Parked outside.\nPhoto by Cody James\u201cWe just want to sell tacos,\u201d said owner Albert Hern\u00e1ndez as he took orders. \u201cWe\u2019ve brought much fame to the city and want to make everyone proud.\u201dSo, America: If you ever want to meet me, just look for Santa Ana\u2019s pink taco truck. I even take my laptop there. Because who needs a corner office with a view when you have tacos acorazados?Gustavo Arellano is a writer and author of Taco USA.ContentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Explore Bon App\u00e9titNeighborhood RestaurantsTacoRecipes you want to make.
