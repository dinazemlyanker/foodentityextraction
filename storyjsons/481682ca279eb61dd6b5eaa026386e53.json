But when do you need to do it, and when do you not?By Alex DelanyJanuary 2, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailAlex LauFacebookTwitterEmailHot stones. Pleasant scents. Wooden rollers. Deep breaths. Getting that stupid knot out of your shoulder. A massage sounds nice. Massaging kale? That sounds kind of\u2026weird. What\u2019s the deal with massaging kale anyway? Why do we do it?Great questions. Glad to see you\u2019re so interested in the field of leafy green education. Of all the greens we like to consume, kale is definitely the most stubborn. Not in its opinions on politics or nineties sit coms. We\u2019re talking about its texture. Regardless of variety, raw kale is kind of tough, which is why we love cooking it\u2014it holds its own and maintains integrity even in long-cooked soups, stews, and braises. But we also love eating it raw in salads, which is where that massaging process comes in. Working those greens with your hands a bit takes the edge off, and renders them tender enough to eat without cooking. You don't always have to do it\u2014more on that later\u2014but if you're going to, here's how to do it.No stems, no problems.\nLet\u2019s start with the stems. And by start, we mean throw them the hell out. Kale stems are tough and fibrous. We don\u2019t need that. You can slice them out with a knife or rip them out by running you fingers along either side of the stem. It\u2019s less precise, but it works.Now, we massage. Hit those leaves with a pinch of salt and a squeeze of lemon or a splash of vinegar, and then start crunching them between your hands. The trick here is not to over-massage. You know what\u2019s worse than tough kale? Mushy kale. Over-massaged kale loses that texture we love so much. Rub the kale leaves together between your fingers, until they just start to wilt. The way to tell if you\u2019ve hit the right point, as it is with most things, is to taste. You want to massage the leaves to the point where it you can feel a crisp and resistance in the bite, but aren\u2019t struggling to tear away or chew. It should feel more crispy than rubbery.If you're shredding your kale, like in our Winter Crunch Salad, you don't need to massage it.\nPhoto by Heidi's Bridge, styling by Molly BazSo when do you need to massage kale, and when should you not? By and large, we only massage kale for salad when we're working with big, leafy pieces, for a salad we're planning on serving immediately. If the kale is getting shredded into thin pieces or chopped to bits, you don't need to work it over before serving it raw\u2014whatever dressing and tossing you're doing already should render it tender enough. Also, if you're going to dress a salad well ahead of time and let it hang out in the fridge, massaging isn't necessary. Acids like citrus juice and vinegar break down the cellulose in kale in the same way that massaging it does. That means that if you aren\u2019t serving your salad immediately after dressing it, you shouldn\u2019t massage it. Just let it hang out in a bowl with the dressing. And if you're working with tender baby kale, the kind you find packed in plastic tubs with the salad greens, you definitely don't need to massage it\u2014that stuff is delicate enough to eat on its own, and massaging it will just wilt it in a gross way.You need to love your kale before it loves you. Or you love it? Or you love yourself? Whatever. Just give the stuff a massage if it needs it, OK?Winter Crunch Salad time is now, no massaging necessary:Explore Bon App\u00e9titBasicallySaladKaleRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
