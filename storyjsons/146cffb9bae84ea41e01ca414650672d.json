I fold pants and stash them away. I check the questionable undersides of toilet seats. I lint-roll cat fur off furniture. And I put out water and wine glasses and a water pitcher, like this pretty one I found at Jung Lee in New York.Doesn\u2019t it look like something Snow White would pour lemonade out of for her seven ungrateful boyfriends? I don\u2019t spend a lot of time outdoors, but this pitcher makes me feel as if I\u2019d like it there. It makes me drink more water just so I can make a show of pouring it. The angled branch handle is the perfect spot for tiny singing birds to land before they braid my hair. Two green and yellow glass leaves have budded within the pitcher, a detail I appreciate because it serves no purpose other than beauty. Too many things in my life our sturdy and utilitarian if not downright ugly. This delicate pitcher is a reminder to spike it with some loveliness once in a while.Fun facts: It\u2019s made by the Italian glassware maker Ichendorf, it\u2019s 16 ounces, and it\u2019s borosilicate glass, which means it can hold up to temperature changes without cracking. If I decide to become a person who decants their wine (and here\u2019s why), I could use it as a cheery decanter. Think of how fun it would be with a batch of ros\u00e9 Aperol spritzes! Think of what a great gift it would make for the holidays, someone\u2019s wedding, or a housewarming! But since my life revolves around me and my needs, it\u2019ll stay to the center-left on my table, reminding me I could probably use another glass of cold, clear, tap water.Buy it: Ichendorf Greenwood Jug, $55 at Jung LeeAll products featured on Bonappetit.com are independently selected by our editors.
