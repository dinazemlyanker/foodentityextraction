Pro tip: If you sign up for the newsletter, you'll get the scoop before everyone else.Healthyish friends!I admit I'm not in a Thanksgiving mindset yet, thanks to the stomach bug I've been battling, but Healthyish food editor Chris Morocco has been in the mindset since July. Which gave him plenty of time to dream up this beautiful, festive, and utterly delicious squash and caramelized onion tart. (For the record, Chris wanted to call this recipe Things Fall, A Tart, for which he deserves many hand-clap emojis).

The packaging may be millennial bait, but I love chai anything, and it's rare to come across versions without caffeine.Reads of the WeekNow that the midterm elections are over, I'm reading some fiction again: Neon in Daylight by Hermione Hoby and the fairy tales in T's recent travel issue. (The story written in sequence by 10 Florida-based writers is a feat, but my favorite might be Michael Cunningham's, narrated by an actual fairy and inspired by that Leonard Cohen song.And Last But Also FirstWe're thinking about our Healthyish friends and communities that've been affected by the fires across California.
