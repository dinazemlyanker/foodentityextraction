Maybe there\u2019s something lovey-dovey written in chocolate sauce on the edge of the plate like \u201cLove ya, sweetcheeks.\u201d A piano guy plays instrumental Phil Collins in the background. LOVE IS SO BEAUTIFUL! The chocolate oozes out of the center, and you realize it\u2019s a metaphor. Your heart melts.Kisskisskiss!Or something like that. At home, no one goes full molten chocolate cake. It requires making a cake, and a ganache, and doing all kinds of cake gymnastics to make sure the sponge is tender and cooked, the ganache properly melted and silky. It\u2019s a lot.THIS YEAR IT\u2019S GOING TO BE DIFFERENT. Chris Morocco wanted a Valentine Day\u2019s dessert that wasn\u2019t cheesy, difficult, or overdone. (Sorry red velvet, that means you.) Then Chris had an undisputed good idea: molten caramel cake. \u201cYes we want that,\u201d\u2014said everyone at the ideas meeting.Gimme that oozy center!\nPhoto by Chelsie Craig, Food Styling by Pearl JonesWhen he first began developing the recipe, he made his own caramel. \u201cIt was a whole thing,\u201d he sighed. But since store-bought dulce de leche is so good, we went with that instead. (Ease, remember?) FYI, the Bon App\u00e9tit Test Kitchen uses San Ignacio or La Serenisima. Here\u2019s the breakdown:The sponge of the caramel cake has dulce de leche in it too, plus the usual cake ingredients (flour, butter, egg, sugar, vanilla, salt). It ends up nutty and toasty from the caramelized milk. Plus, it's plenty salty (in a good way) and moist.The molten filling is dulce de leche with butter added to it. The water in the butter (yes butter has water!) helps the mixture chill and firm up in the freezer, which makes it near solid so that it doesn\u2019t sink into the cake batter. Important!The technique is two steps. Fill sugar-and-butter lined ramekins (this recipe makes four cakes) with cake batter. Make a half-inch divot in the center of the batter and plop the dulce de leche there, right on top. Any deeper and it might sink to the bottom. No need to add more cake batter on top, it\u2019ll all work out I swear. The cakes are done when a tester on the side of the cake, in the sponge part (not the molten center), comes out clean. Invert them onto a plate and say something romantic, something French, like: \u201cvoila!\u201d And profess your love for whatever or whoever you\u2019re loving this Valentine\u2019s Day. It might just be this cake.Get the recipe:Molten Caramel CakesEverybody has heard of molten chocolate cake, so we thought we\u2019d try to create a caramel version, with a toffee-ish tender cake encasing a runny dulce de leche center.View RecipeBuy It: San Ignacio Dulce de Leche 2-pack, $20 on amazon.com.Buy It: La Serenisima Dulce de Leche 400gm, $17 on amazon.com.All products featured on Bonappetit.com are independently selected by our editors.
