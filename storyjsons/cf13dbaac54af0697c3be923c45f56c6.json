In this version, we sear the chewy rice cakes until the outsides are crisp before tossing them in the spicy-sweet gochujang sauce. Bok choy is unorthodox, but its crisp-tender texture is a welcome addition. And while fish cakes are totally optional, we recommend taking a trip to the freezer section of your favorite Asian supermarket to explore all the different kinds.Ingredients6 servings3medium to large dried anchovies12x2\" piece dried kombu\u00bcsmall plus 2 large onions, sliced8garlic cloves, 2 smashed, 6 thinly sliced8oz. assorted frozen odeng (Korean fish cakes)\u2154cup gochujang (Korean hot pepper paste)2Tbsp. soy sauce1Tbsp. gochugaru (coarse Korean red pepper powder)\u00bccup canola or vegetable oil1lb. cylindrical rice cakes (about 2\u00bd\" long), cut in half crosswise on a diagonal1medium head of bok choy, bulbs cut into \u00bc\" pieces, leaves sliced into 1\" pieces2scallions, thinly sliced on a diagonal, divided3large hard-boiled eggs, halved lengthwise2Tbsp. toasted sesame seeds, crushedPreparationStep 1Bring anchovies, kombu, \u00bc small sliced onion, 2 smashed garlic cloves, and 3\u00bd cups water to a boil in a small pot.

Oftentimes, sugar or rice syrup is used to sweeten the dish. Tteokbokki is sweet and spicy dish.AnonymousLos Angeles, CA11/20/2020This turned out unbelievably good! I used a larger bag of rice cakes (2.5 lb) and decided to throw em all in and yeah, it was pleeenty of spice with the 2/3 c gochujang. I wasn't feeling bok choy and instead chopped up a small head of savoy cabbage which went great. Tasty and I have plenty of leftovers!kmarxmarxchicago, il9/30/2020To say this is hellish spicy is an understatement. My eyes were streaming while I ate as quickly as possible so as not to prolong the agony. I recommend adding some Greek yogurt to the sauce if you find yourself in the same predicament, and have a bowl of ice cream at the ready. I would make it again, but would omit the chili flakes. The dashi stock is magical; it\u2019s responsible for the success of the dish. Didn\u2019t have the fish cakes so just added leftover ground beef and it was wonderful. Ground pork would probably be even better.CincyGalCincinnati6/7/2020This tasted as delightful as the picture, and was just as fun to make!! Spicy, sticky, and squishy. This recipe was really easy to follow and I was very pleased with the results. I added a little brown sugar to the sauce and did bok choy on the side instead. clairejSan Diego5/11/2020So spicy! Definitely coughed and started crying when I took the first bite, but got used to the spice by the end of it. This recipe is really easy, with a big flavor pay off. Most of the work is cutting things up, the rest is just the occasional stir. I didn't make a special trip to the store for this, I was using what I had, so I used a few oil packed anchovy filets in the broth instead of dried anchovies, omitted the gochugaru (which probably would have killed me anyway because I'm a spice lightweight), and left out the fish cakes (although they would have been really good). It all comes together very quickly, around 30-40 minutes total if you put together the broth first and simmer it for 25 minutes while you prep everything else and get started cooking the rice cakes and aromatics. abbyrnkn4422AL9/21/2019Explore Bon App\u00e9titKoreanEast AsianAsianBok ChoyLeafy GreensVegetableKorean Rice CakeNoodlePasta & NoodlesQuickWeeknight MealsMainLunar New YearDinnerRecipes you want to make.
