Now's your chance.By Christina ChaeyMarch 26, 2020FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Christina ChaeyFacebookTwitterEmailWe're spending more time in our homes than ever before. In \"There's No Better Time To...\" we'll share the little projects we're finally getting around to. Today: FaceTime a friend and have a virtual cooking lesson.For months, my friend Sue and I have been talking about getting together with Claire (yes, that Claire) to have a homemade dumpling night. We\u2019d say, \u201cWe should make dumplings together sometime!\u201d which, in normal times, translates to \u201cWe\u2019re never doing this.\u201d  But normal times there are not.One night last week, with no plans and itching for a cooking project, I texted Sue and told her I was thinking about making some wontons with the package of wonton wrappers I panic-bought at the store, and would she mind coaching me through how to make them? A few minutes later, we were FaceTiming, I was opening a bottle of wine, and Sue was rummaging around her desk for a Post-It to demonstrate proper wonton-folding technique. She drew a circle on the Post-It to indicate where I was supposed to add the filling. It was the kind of thing we would have never gotten around to in our normal lives, when so many other obligations and plans keep us away from these small shared kitchen moments.Homemade dumplings in dashi with spinach, shichimi togarashi, and tofu.\nPhoto by Christina ChaeyI ended the evening pleasantly tipsy, with a trayful of wontons filled with goods from the pantry like rehydrated dried shiitake mushrooms, diced water chestnuts, and lots of ginger. I froze them in a single layer on a sheet tray and then stashed them in a bag, ready to boil at a moment\u2019s notice to eat with a drizzle of nutty sesame sauce or chile crisp. Recently, in need of an extra dose of comfort, I\u2019ve been adding a handful of them to piping-hot savory brothy soups with lots of wilted greens (you could skip the soba in this Soba Soup With Shrimp and Greens and cook a few wontons directly in the dashi broth instead and it would be so good!)I want to tackle different kinds of fillings and folding techniques next\u2014and when I have a chance to get more wonton provisions, I know who I\u2019ll be FaceTiming.Explore Bon App\u00e9titThere's No Better Time CoronavirusBasicallyRecipes you want to make.
