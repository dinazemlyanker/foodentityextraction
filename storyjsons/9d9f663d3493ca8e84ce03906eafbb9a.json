Whisk eggs, buttermilk, coconut oil, brown sugar, and vanilla in a medium bowl until smooth. Add to dry ingredients and whisk until smooth; mix in chocolate.Step 4Lightly coat waffle iron with nonstick spray. Scoop batter onto waffle iron (it should cover the entire surface; amount needed will vary according to model) and cook waffles until you smell a blast of chocolaty aroma hit you and edges are slightly darkened, around 3 minutes per batch. Remove carefully from waffle iron. Without gluten, waffles will be extra tender.Step 5Serve waffles topped with whipped ricotta, crumble, and maple syrup.How would you rate Gluten-Free Chocolate Buckwheat Waffles?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (5)Back to TopTriangle I would appreciate suggestions for substitutions for the cocoa powder and chocolate chunks since I am allergic to those foods.JDDayton, OH9/29/2021Great recipe! My kids 5 and 7 loved it. They also freeze well. Robin KAshland, OR9/13/2021Enjoyed this recipe. Nice flavor, but I do find that it has a high degree of variability. Keep in mind that not all buckwheat flour and flax seed meal are created equal. If you have a less fine grind (especially if you grind your own buckwheat), you may need to add additional dry ingredients to reach the correct consistency. I recommend adding wet ingredients slowly as to avoid over-hydrating the batter. AnonymousAnchorage, Alaska9/25/2020Turned out very good, unlike most gluten free waffles I've tried these have a nice fluffy texture and the buckwheat flavour isn't overpowering. Will definetly make these again :) AnonymousCanada 7/27/2019Awesome recipe, just watched the video and made them. Easy, quick, and delicious!
