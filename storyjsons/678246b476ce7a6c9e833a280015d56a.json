At first he was hesitant about it as it went against all his training: Larb should only be made with meat! When Talat Market was a pop-up, the kitchen at one point had too many butternut squash, carrots, and parsnips lying around. In a late-night menu session to find a solution, co-owner Rod Lassiter suggested using them to make a larb. They tried it, liked it, and customers loved it.Ingredients4 ServingsToasted Rice Powder\u00bccup dry sticky rice1lemongrass stalk, bottom third only,tough outer layers removed, thinly sliced11\" piece galangal, peeled, thinly sliced4fresh makrut (Thai) lime leavesDressing2garlic clovesKosher salt2\u20133red Thai chiles3Tbsp. fresh lime juice1Tbsp. fish sauce2tsp. granulated sugarLarb and assembly\u00bdsmall butternut squash (about 1 lb.), peeled, seeds removed, cut into 1\" pieces1lb. medium carrots or parsnips (about 4), peeled, cut into 1\" pieces2Tbsp. vegetable oilKosher salt2scallions, thinly sliced\u00bdcup cilantro with tender stems\u00bdcup mint leaves, torn if largePreparationToasted Rice PowderStep 1Toast rice, lemongrass, galangal, and lime leaves in a dry medium skillet, stirring occasionally, over medium heat until about 80 percent of rice is golden brown, 5\u20137 minutes. Transfer to a plate; let cool.Step 2Place rice mixture in a blender and pulse until texture is sandy but not too fine (a little texture is good). Set aside.DressingStep 3Smash garlic and a small pinch of salt to a coarse paste with a mortar and pestle. Add chiles and lightly smash (the finer you pound the chiles, the spicier the dressing will be). Mix in lime juice, fish sauce, sugar, and 1 Tbsp. water. (Or, finely chop garlic and salt, then chiles, on a cutting board and smash with the side of a chef\u2019s knife. Mix in a bowl with remaining ingredients.)Larb and assemblyStep 4Preheat oven to 400\u00b0. Toss squash, carrots, and oil on a rimmed baking sheet to coat; season with salt.

I made this with sticky rice for my vegan-skeptical family members and they all loved it. Super delicious and so worth it! (I didn't have galangal so I substituted w/ginger). Jennifer KLittle Rock, AR1/18/2021Super good! I couldn\u2019t find galangal, so I had to omit it, but it was still delicious. This will definitely go into our rotation.
