We asked 80 of the most interesting people we know to reveal the local spots they love the most.Everyone who grows up somewhere people like to vacation knows about two kinds of places in their town. The places \u201cfor them\u201d and the places \u201cfor us.\u201d Times Square is for them; Riverside Park is for us. Pink Taco on Sunset Strip\u2014them; Gjelina on Abbot Kinney\u2014us. This distinction isn\u2019t necessarily about quality\u2014there are plenty of good meals to be had at places for them (see Caf\u00e9 du Monde in New Orleans, Joe\u2019s Stone Crab in Miami Beach). Nor is it another rendition of the \u201cOh, the locals love this place\u201d line that tour bus operators like to whisper in the ears of their patrons. This \u201cfor us\u201d is about intent. It\u2019s about a business built by and for local people, by someone who loves their town enough to want to make the act of living in it a littler sweeter and more delicious.Fire Island Rustic Bakeshop in Anchorage, Alaska, is a place \u201cfor us.\u201d Housed in a nothing-special building in a residential part of Anchorage with lousy parking and a checkered past (chosen by the founders in the hopes of improving the neighborhood, a plan that appears to have worked), the bakery wasn\u2019t opened with the intention to serve the legion of tourists who flock to Anchorage every summer to take selfies against the backdrop of Mount Susitna. Fire Island was established by lifelong Alaskans Janis Fleischman and Jerry Lewanski, a retired school assistant principal and her husband who hired their daughter and son-in-law as their first bakers. This place was  built for actual Alaskans, the kind who know that June is a prize won only by wresting victory over February, a month so dark and relentless that its pain could only be salved by a raspberry scone the size of a rugby ball.Fire Island is an altar to bread, with classics like Alaska whole wheat and Fire Island sourdough turned out daily and specials like challah, plum flax, and sprouted grain offered on specific weekdays. It takes about .01 seconds inside the bakery to understand just how seriously these people take bread. It\u2019s everywhere, taking pride of place on the biggest counter in the shop, stacked on baking racks in the open kitchen, sketched in chalk on the daily menu. The current baker, Carlyle Watt, was was named by the James Beard Foundation as an \"outstanding baker\u201d semi-finalist in 2017. And outstanding he is. Give anyone behind the counter half a chance, and they will gladly recount the story of their sourdough starter or outline every seed used in their Vollkornbrot, a dense pumpernickel that is as proud a home for smoked salmon and dill as any bagel from Manhattan. (If you still question the Fire Island loyalty to a good loaf, know this: An entire section of the company website is dedicated to its storage, complete with recommendations for auxiliary reading.)A spread of options from Fire Island.\nPhoto by Linda MurphyThe pastry case offers a disorienting, fine-boned selection of cakes and tarts more likely to be associated with French accents and pastry obsessives than the ruddy-cheeked and bearded clan you\u2019ll typically find behind the counter at Fire Island. Think polenta cakes topped with chubby blackberries baked with flecks of Earl Grey and lemon tarts drizzled with tiny threads of dark chocolate. Between the delta of sourdough and galettes runs a trail of classics: chunky chocolate chip cookies; massive, flaky scones in flavors like blackberry-rhubarb and ham, cheddar, and chive; and a cupcake selection that my picky sugar-obsessed fianc\u00e9 has deemed G.O.A.T. And I promise you, he\u2019s consumed enough cupcakes in his lifetime to be considered an authority.But I dare say the food isn\u2019t even the most special thing about Fire Island. Three summers ago, the caterer for my brother\u2019s wedding dropped out of his family brunch less than 24 hours out. I called Fire Island. The next morning, a shopgirl greeted me with a tower of boxes full of enough warm scones, pastries, and bread to feed our army, and a hot cup of coffee and a cookie for the road, which she rightly guessed I could use.It\u2019s an early stop on any trip home, and I know that once I\u2019m inside I\u2019ll be greeted by the familiar smells of bread and cooked fruit as well as my high school running coach or the woman from my mother\u2019s book club, whose name I never quite remember but whose face I am always happy to see. It\u2019s a place where people stop in daily for coffee and a morning bun after they\u2019ve dug out their tires from the snowfall the night before, or take the soccer team postgame in the summer months for cupcakes. It\u2019s the perfect spot for nourishment or just company, the highest quality of both are always on offer. My friend Elizabeth, who has lived a few blocks from the flagship shop since it was established (the owners added a second store two years ago and another one is set to open in just a few months), says one of the few things she appreciates about Anchorage in January is that it\u2019s when the Fire Island staff goes on a several-week hiatus, which means she loses weight and saves money.This is what defines a place \u201cfor us.\u201d It\u2019s a place that weaves its way into the fabric of your daily life\u2014and leaves you better for it. Sure, visitors flock to Fire Island in the summer months now, and as well they should\u2014the owners and staff deserve every good thing, including the success that comes with making the guidebooks. So please, come check it out on your trip up north and tell your friends. Just know that while it may seem like it\u2019s for you, the good people of Anchorage, Alaska, are only sharing.Genevieve Roth is a fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School.ContentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Explore Bon App\u00e9titNeighborhood RestaurantsBreadRead MorecultureLove Is a Cold Cocktail in the Middle of Frigid AlaskaBy Maya WilsonrestaurantsBull Moose and Canned Everything: Growing up on an Alaskan DietBy Alexis M.
