Your salivary glands are activated, and you\u2019re ready to dash to the store for a bag of buckwheat flour. Running down the ingredient list, you confirm that you have everything else in your pantry\u2014with the exception of \u201cbittersweet chocolate bars or discs.\u201d But not a big deal, you have chocolate chips and can use those instead, right?You could, but before you do, allow us to talk you out of it. There\u2019s a time and a place for chocolate chips, but these cookies were developed specifically with chopped-up chocolate discs or bars in mind. Here\u2019s why.Chocolate chips are formulated to hold their shape, even at high temperatures. \u201cYou could microwave a chip for 20 seconds, and it\u2019ll still have that Smurf hat thing going on,\u201d says Basically editor Sarah Jampel. Think of chips like the Meg March of the baking chocolate world\u2014poised, put-together, and composed in every circumstance.Chocolate discs and chopped bars, on the other hand, have a higher percentage of cocoa butter, which means that when they\u2019re exposed to heat, they melt down into gooey choco pockets. They\u2019re the Jo\u2014a little sloppy, a little messy, but absolutely the life of the party.In situations where you want to bite into a self-contained nugget of chocolate\u2014double chocolate brownies, banana bread, scones (a very Meg baked good)\u2014chips are the answer. Were you to use discs or chopped bars instead of chips in a pancake batter, you\u2019d end up with a melty pool of chocolate in the frying pan rather than distinct pieces of chocolate speckled throughout your stack.But when melty is the goal, reach for discs or bars. \u201cIf you use chopped-up discs or bars in these cookies, when you break them in half, you\u2019ll get a chocolate river,\u201d says Sarah. A chocolate river. If you substitute chips for discs, instead of an unctuous puddle of molten chocolate adorning the top of every cookie, you\u2019ll get...Smurf hats.Chopped bars or discs can be used interchangeably with chocolate wafers, pistoles, or f\u00e8ves, all of which are suitable for melting and look like either buttons or beans. In the Test Kitchen, we use Guittard Organic Bittersweet Chocolate Baking Wafers, which also come in semisweet and milk chocolate varieties, though you can often find similar products packaged near the bulk section. Store them in a cool dry place for whenever the baking urge strikes. \u201cYou won\u2019t ruin anything by using chopped discs when a recipe calls for chips,\u201d Sarah says, \u201calthough you might not get the precise look you want because they\u2019re going to melt. But if a recipe calls for discs or bars\u2014especially melted down for something like a chocolate mousse\u2014you might ruin it by using chips.\u201dDiplomatically, we\u2019ll say that discs and chopped bars aren\u2019t necessarily better than chips; they\u2019re just different. But let\u2019s be honest, is Meg anyone\u2019s favorite March sister?Guittard, Organic 74% Chocolate Baking Wafers, 12 oz$12 at AmazonGuittard, 70% Bittersweet Cocoa Baking Bars, 6 oz (Pack of 4)$25 at AmazonExplore Bon App\u00e9titBasically BakingShoppingChocolateRecipes you want to make.
