During the summer months, tomatoes are the perfect match for that acidic, sweet, and slightly-funky dressing, which is inspired by Anthony\u2019s mom\u2019s nuoc cham. She blew our minds when she revealed that her recipe is as simple as equal parts lime juice, sugar, and fish sauce. It hits all the notes, and can truly make just about anything taste better. \u2014Anthony Ha and Sadie Mae Burns, Ha\u2019s Dac Biet, NYCIngredients4 - 6 Servings\u00bccup sugar\u00bccup fish sauce (preferably Red Boat or Three Crabs)\u00bccup fresh lime juice1small fennel bulb, thinly sliced1Persian or kirby cucumber, halved lengthwise, sliced into half-moons1Hungarian wax, Jimmy Nardello, or  green bell pepper, seeds and ribs removed, sliced1small shallot, thinly sliced1\u00bdlb. mixed heirloom tomatoes, halved if small, cut into wedges if large2cups coarsely chopped mixed tender herbs (such as dill, cilantro, and/or Thai basil)Freshly ground black pepper\u2153cup crushed salted dry-roasted peanuts\u2153cup store-bought fried shallotsPreparationStep 1Place sugar, fish sauce, lime juice, and 1 Tbsp. water in a jar.

SKH9/9/2021This has great Vietnamese flavors, except I\u2019ve never seen dill in a Vietnamese dish,  I added spearmint leaves, chopped, which made it perfect.No\u00eblle 505Corrales, NM9/5/2021I know fish sauce is one of the most difficult things to subsitute for, and I\u2019m sure this won\u2019t be different, but\u2026 any ideas for how to make this vegetarian?
