I would come to him with my problems, and he would be my shifu.\u201d Her grandpa would dispense his advice over a pot of jasmine tea\u2014his favorite. When she was searching for a name for her tea company, she kept returning to the intimacies they shared over steaming cups of cha at his house in Shanghai. Us Two Tea was born.Halfway across the world in Akron, Ohio, Smita Satiani\u2019s afternoons were organized around tea time. \u201cEvery day between 3 p.m. and 4 p.m, my mom would make a pot of chai. It was non-negotiable,\u201d recalls Satiani, who co-founded Alaya Tea with fellow South Asian-American Esha Chhabra. Satiani and her sister sipped warm, spiced milk alongside their mother until they graduated to tea in junior high. \u201cI was deemed old enough to drink caffeine around the same time I was allowed to start threading my eyebrows,\u201d Satiani says. \u201cReal rites of passage!\u201dXue and Satiani\u2019s childhood experiences are, in many ways, at odds with the current face of tea culture in America. While sweetened, ready-to-drink iced tea still dominates the sector and the anthropomorphic menagerie of Celestial Seasonings isn\u2019t going anywhere, younger consumers are increasingly embracing tea as a healthful alternative to other beverages. Eighty-seven percent of millennials now identify as tea drinkers, and categories like kombucha and functional tea blends are on the rise. For many non-Asian Americans, tea is associated not with weekend dim sum or lingering visits with aunties but with wellness, detoxes, and mindfulness. The founders of tea company Leaves and Flowers identify their clientele as \u201cwomen who are interested in taking care of themselves.\u201d In a juicy New York Times piece about the tea acolytes of Topanga Canyon, the former frontman of Incubus\u2014whose ex-girlfriend performs elaborate tea ceremonies for a community of shamanic healers and supermodels\u2014is quoted as saying, \u201cTea was heading in one direction, and then it got knocked towards Venice.\u201dUs Two's lightly oxidized baozhong tea.\ncourtesy of Us TwoUs Two and Alaya are part of a micro-trend of direct-to-consumer tea companies helmed by women with roots in tea drinking cultures. For their founders, the Venicification of tea is both a boon for business and a motivation to make their voices heard in the industry. \u201cThere\u2019s no wrong way to enjoy tea, but this overly reverent approach feels very at odds with how I experience tea when I visit my family in Chaozhou,\u201d says Diana Zheng of Three Gems Tea, who lived in Guangdong Province for four years before her family immigrated to the United States. Her co-founder, Daphne Wu, who has since left the company, adds, \u201cNot everyone lives in a zen garden, and you don\u2019t need a tea master in order to have a tea ceremony. When Diana and I go back to Chaozhou, drinking tea is a casual way to connect socially with people.\u201dAarika Patel, owner of Suraj Spices & Teas in Nashville, grew up hating chai and was amazed when \u201cchai tea lattes\u201d started popping up on menus in mainstream coffee shops. \u201cIt\u2019s always interesting when you see things from your own culture sweep across America,\u201d says Patel, \u201cbut you don\u2019t identify with the way it\u2019s presented or who gets to be the face of it\u2014like yoga.\u201d As an Indian-American who prefers green tea to black\u2014\u201cthe green sheep of the family,\u201d she likes to say\u2014Patel is not out to police who is allowed to enjoy tea and who isn\u2019t. \u201cBut,\u201d she adds, \u201cit is important to remember the people behind the tea.\u201dThose people behind the tea often get a raw deal. The supply chain for tea is lengthy; leaves are picked, processed, sold at auction, blended and packaged, and delivered to retail, with middlemen taking their cuts at each step of the process. With a box of 100 tea bags selling in grocery stores for $4, the smallholder farmers who grow the tea and the agricultural laborers who harvest it often live below the poverty line. In the Indian state of Assam, the pickers who work on large estates\u2014mostly women\u2014are paid well below minimum wage, making less than $2 a day and creating a climate where girls with few options are trafficked into slavery.The founders of Three Gems, Us Two, and Alaya find themselves uniquely positioned to do business differently by establishing direct relationships with farmers. \"Esha and I both speak Hindi and have worked in India before, and that familiarity with culture and customs has been enormously beneficial in working with folks on the ground,\u201d says Satiani, who spent childhood summers in India and Pakistan. Sourcing their black and green teas directly from growers in Assam and Darjeeling ensures that they\u2019re buying high-quality leaves that haven\u2019t been languishing in a broker\u2019s warehouse for months. And without several layers of middlemen, profits go straight into farmers\u2019 pockets.Similarly, Zheng, Wu, and their co-founder Ayumi Takahashi all speak Mandarin, and they buy their tea from farmers in China and Taiwan. Three Gems currently sells six varieties of oolong\u2014whose evocative names, like Forever Spring, Orchid Fragrance, and Duck Shit hint at the diversity of this style of tea\u2014sourced from farms that are pesticide free if not certified organic. \u201cTransparency is really important to us,\u201d Zheng says, \u201cand so we value being able to go to the farm, talk to our suppliers about their regenerative farming practices, and translate that to our customers. We know they\u2019re not spraying with pesticides because we can see the rigor of their methods with our own eyes.\u201dBy introducing American tea drinkers to these single origin teas, Three Gems also hopes to challenge negative perceptions about China and Chinese products. \u201cWe work with farmers who are incredibly strict,\u201d says Wu. \u201cOne grower we visited won\u2019t even let animals from neighboring farms wander around his land because he can\u2019t control what they eat or where they poop. We want to show people that there are great products coming out of China made by people who care about health and the earth.\u201d To better showcase the quality of their product, Three Gems\u2014like Alaya and Us Two\u2014sells their tea in loose leaf form. As opposed to the broken, powdery residue typically found in tea bags, Three Gems\u2019 oolong leaves unfurl in hot water, a scant teaspoon of dried tea blooming to fill an entire tea strainer.As with so many first-generation Americans, the founders of these tea companies are performing the role of translator, presenting their parents\u2019 traditions in a way that can be understood by Americans who didn\u2019t grow up drinking tea. \u201cHow do we take the best parts of Indian tea culture and introduce it to an American demographic that might drink chai and be into Ayurveda but who are not Indian?\u201d asks Satiani. \u201cHow do we do that in a way that does not water down our tea, both metaphorically and literally?\" Satiani won\u2019t be releasing a Pumpkin Spice Chai blend anytime soon, but she and Chhabra have been savvy about how to appeal to a tea-drinking audience that may not be able to pinpoint Darjeeling on a map. Alaya\u2019s labels come in dusty hues of ochre, rose, and pistachio, all \u201csoft colors/earthy tones\u201d that would satisfy the Topanga tea ceremony's dress code. Three Gems\u2019 logo is reminiscent of a Matisse collage; the hands holding their products sport glittery nails. Us Two, whose branding features both blobby shapes and shades of blush, sells some of their teas in bags to lower the barrier to entry for those scared off by loose leaf. The packaging might be Venice catnip\u2014but the goods satisfy non-Asian Americans, third culture kids, and immigrants alike. \u201cMy parents may not \u2018get\u2019 our branding,\u201d Satiani says, \u201cbut they love our tea.\u201dExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishTeaShoppingTrendsRead MoreLifestyle\"I'm Not a Woo-Woo Wellness Ayurvedic Yoga Instructor Selling You Turmeric\"By Priya KrishnaRecipes you want to make.
