Sisters (and pastry chefs) Stephanie and Andrea French have both talent and gumption, opening their first pint-size location in just nine days and surviving a fire that nearly ruined their new shop. Now The Pie Shoppe is busier than ever, sourcing thousands of pounds of British Columbian fruit to make their highly coveted pies.ORDER THE: salted honey with East Van honey and salt from Vancouver Island; chocolate peanut butter; and something seasonal, like the raspberry rhubarb or grapefruit and amaro custard.THE VIBE IS: serene, with light flooding in from both the front and back of the shop. There\u2019s a long shelf filled with vinyls (courtesy of Mom and Dad French) and artful touches throughout from the sisters\u2019 many crafty friends. But let\u2019s be real: You\u2019ll be spending most of your time hovering over all the latticed, sugar-crusted gems on the counter.PRACTICAL STUFF: Open Wednesday to Saturday, from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; and Sunday, from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Closed Monday and Tuesday. Need a whole pie? Call ahead to secure it!\u2014Lindsay AndersonCourtesy of The Pie ShoppeCourtesy of The Pie ShoppeWE ALSO LOVEBeta5A Mount Pleasant sweets shop pushing cacao boundaries since 2011Ask for LuigiEat all the fresh pasta in Railtown\u2019s most charming spaceBeaucoupAn outstanding bakery worth the (slight) trek to KitsilanoExplore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
