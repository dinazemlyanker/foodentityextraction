But over the years, as California wanted to compete with the world\u2019s serious wine regions, grapes such as Mission were cast aside for more established ones like Chardonnay and Cabernet Sauvignon.Now, as modern winemakers explore the forgotten diversity of California grapes, these thin-skinned table wine grapes are helping them recapture a feel for the state\u2019s wine identity when it was in its early days.You may have had Mission before. It goes by Pa\u00eds in Chile and L\u00edstan Prieto in Spain, where it is grown and vinified all over the Canary Islands. With the propensity for producing softly tannic, tart, chillable, low-alcohol wines, it\u2019s easy to see how Mission has become a favorite of the easy-drinking glou-glou set. But the beauty of Mission is that while the light red packs fruit, it also has the savory, spicy traits of bigger reds, making it a do-it-all food wine too.So next time a za\u2019atar roasted chicken, crunchy acidic salad, or crispy-skinned salmon hits my table, I\u2019ll have a bottle of multidimensional California Mission right there with it. The deeper connection to America\u2019s wine roots is just a nice bonus.Two Bottles to Try:Monte Rio Cellars Lodi 2019: Big-time fruit fragrance and lush herbaceousness (thanks, carbonic maceration) make this Mission especially nice when chilled before opening.Pax Mission \u201cSomer\u2019s Vineyard\u201d 2019: Inspired by the winery\u2019s departure from classic flavors of Chardonnay and Pinot Noir, this wine is all violets, spice, and strawberry-watermelon diesel.Andre Mack is a sommelier, winemaker, author, and designer based in Brooklyn.
