Not for Black Friday, not for night clubs, and certainly not for whatever hype-y food fad that may be dominating Instagram on a given day. But I\u2019ll GLADLY wait in line all night (and nearly have!) for the incredibly satisfying breakfast at House of Pies, a beloved \u201970s-style diner chain with an outpost smack dab in the middle of Houston\u2019s Montrose neighborhood.What would warrant this stark change in character, you ask? The answer is simple: breakfast for dinner. At House of Pies, plate after plate of crispy bacon and creamy soft-scrambled eggs and fluffy biscuits topped with pork-studded gravy arrive at tables like clockwork. The extensive menu can be a lot to take in when you\u2019re trying to order\u2014don\u2019t look at the staggering line-up of picture-perfect pies just yet\u2014so order as I do. Get the chicken fried steak, delightfully craggy, and served with glossy fried eggs and crackly hashbrowns. It\u2019s the perfect Texan breakfast...but for dinner.For dessert, I skip the swirly lemon meringue, brownie-like Texas pecan fudge, and golden egg cream custard for my favorite pie ever: the Bayou Goo. It\u2019s a decadent slice of vanilla and chocolate custards layered with cloud-like cream cheese, toasted pecans, whipped cream, and chocolate shavings. After recommending to all my friends, it\u2019s their favorite pie now too.So while I won\u2019t be caught dead waiting for a midnight movie premiere, I\u2019ll always queue up for House of Pies. Because some things really are worth the wait.Go there: House of PiesExplore Bon App\u00e9titBreakfastHoustonHighly RecommendRestaurantsPieRead MorerestaurantsYou Can\u2019t Go Wrong with \u201cCreamed\u201d + \u201cEggs\u201dBy Adam RapoportRecipes you want to make.
