This time around: how to start a spice collection and put it to use.When spice blends are good, they\u2019re game-changers, providing big, complex flavor so that you don\u2019t have to toast and grind a potpourri of spices to make a weeknight meal. But if you\u2019re picking up a random blend from the grocery store, you probably don\u2019t know exactly what you\u2019re getting: Spice blends can be unpredictable and confining, tethering you to a flavor combination that you might not love. Some also contain added salt, which throws off your seasoning. And, unless you're getting it from a trusted source, it might be on the stale side.By replacing your jars of amorphous, aging spice blends (curry powder, taco seasoning, steak rub, your time is up) with the constituent spices themselves (like cumin, coriander, and turmeric, for example), you\u2019ll have more options for customizing to your liking.All that being said, there are some spice mixes that we lean on because they\u2019re tricky to make or specific enough that they\u2019re fairly reliable. Here\u2019s our shortlist:Vadouvan: thought to be born out of the French colonial rule of Pondicherry, India, the base of this sweet and slightly smoky masala (i.e. spice mix) is granulated shallots, onion, and garlic, with fenugreek being a common addition; try it in yogurt dip or as part of a dry rub for roast chickenZa'atar: bright, herbaceous, and toasty, it varies across the Middle East but is often a combo of dried oregano, thyme, and/or marjoram with sumac and toasted sesame seedsOld Bay: a proprietary blend of celery salt, paprika, and pepper, it goes hand in hand with shellfishChaat masala: made up of dry mango powder, cumin, coriander, black salt, asafetida, and chile powder, it adds an umami funk to everything from sliced fruit to boiled potatoesFive-spice powder: the eponymous number refers not to the components (which can include star anise, cinnamon, cloves, Sichuan peppercorns, and fennel seeds, among others), but to its harmonious blend of the five traditional Chinese elements and flavors; try it in these glazey pork ribsPut that blend to use:Sticky-Sweet Five-Spice Pork RibsLacquered with a tangy, garlicky hoisin glaze, these ribs are impressive without being burdensome: There's no grilling or marinating\u2014just two hours in the oven followed by a quick broil.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titSpiceRecipes you want to make.
