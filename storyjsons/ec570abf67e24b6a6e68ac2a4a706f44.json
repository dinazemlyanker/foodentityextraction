But there are those who insist it's not to blame.\u00a0By Priya KrishnaMarch 10, 2020FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Xavier Girard LachaineFacebookTwitterEmailWork a grueling shift on the line, or at the host stand, and get rewarded with booze at the end of the night. It\u2019s called the shift drink, and for years, it\u2019s been an unspoken standard of the hospitality business. Once an insider term for restaurant folk, over the past decade the shift drink has become widely known, even giving its name to podcasts, bars, and comedy troupes. Here at Bon App\u00e9tit, we\u2019ve called it \u201cone of the restaurant industry\u2019s most hallowed traditions.\u201dBut as alcohol consumption has waned nationwide, and the #MeToo movement has lifted the veil on bad behavior fortified by substance-fueled kitchens, a lot of restaurants have started to rethink and renounce the practice. Missy Robbins, the chef of Lilia and Misi in New York, told me, unprompted, that she doesn\u2019t do shift drinks\u00a0because the practice encouraged inappropriate behavior. A few months ago, Angie Mar, chef of the Beatrice Inn in New York, proclaimed on The Sporkful podcast that she doesn\u2019t let her staff drink at work because that\u2019s not the kind of culture she wants to cultivate. Numerous articles have questioned why restaurants even offer shift drinks, considering the liability factor of providing alcohol in the workplace and the booze-fueled bad decisions they perpetuate.Yet there are plenty of restaurateurs who believe that the industry\u2019s systemic problems can\u2019t be fixed by banning a free cocktail, and that the shift drink can even be a helpful, community-building tool.Stefani Velazquez, co-owner of Tlahuac in Houston, used to always offer employees shift drinks, but she felt that people were focused less on the work, and more on their free drink. Last year, she decided to take a break on shift drinks. \u201cEverything was getting done faster, and people weren\u2019t lingering around,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was just a positive environment.\u201d She credits the shift drink ban for this \u2014\u00a0when people weren\u2019t just working toward booze at the end of the night, she says, they were more present.Irene Li, the owner of Mei Mei Restaurant and Mei Mei Street Kitchen in Boston, did the same two years ago, after she noticed that some employees were having a few too many shift drinks.\u201cWe act like this is a benefit to the staff, but it is really not good for them,\u201d she says. \u201cIt makes me feel like less of a hypocrite\u201d to not offer a shift drink altogether. She knows it won\u2019t fix every issue at the restaurant, but \u201cit is a value signal,\u201d she says.Similarly, Michael Beltran, executive chef and co-owner of the Ariete restaurant group, got rid of shift drinks not because he thought they were the root cause of problems, but because of what the practice stood for.When Beltran was a young cook, he used the shift drink as a coping mechanism for the difficulty of the job. \u201cAt very low points, I thought shift drinks were okay midday,\u201d he says.Not offering shift drinks means changing what employees perceive as the reward for their service, he says. \u201cIt is so lazy from a leader perspective to give them a beer and say, \u2018Good job.\u2019\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t get benefits, you get free beer instead.\u201dThe shift drink custom isn\u2019t always enjoyable for employees, either. \u201cSometimes when I am working my manager will just come on the floor and hand me a coffee cup that has a beer in it,\u201d says Meghan, who works at a brewery in Vancouver (editor\u2019s note: she did not provide her last name out of fear of losing her job). \u201cIt\u2019s kind of awkward because I have to drink it or dump it out, and when you dump it out it seems like you\u2019re not fun.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t get benefits, you get free beer instead,\u201d she says, adding that it was \u201cvery normal\u201d for back-of-house staff to be drinking throughout their shifts.A lot of these chefs do offer benefits in lieu of shift drinks. Beltran organizes boxing classes and team lunches. Larson and Li offer healthcare, and Li sets employees up with mental health professionals with flexible hours. Li believes that getting rid of the shift drink should happen in tandem with providing less grueling work schedules and better compensation\u2014factors that initially drive people to substance abuse.But the reality nowadays is that a lot of restaurant workers see the shift drink as one of the most satisfying parts of the job.\u201cShift drinks are sometimes the only bright spot when you\u2019re working a twelve-hour Saturday shift,\u201d says Jake Talon, a line cook in Vancouver.\u201cIt meant a positive ending to a stressful cruddy day,\u201d says Jessica Nelson, who worked at Araka, a former high-end restaurant in Clayton, Missouri. \u201cIt is an affordable perk that the restaurant can offer to foster morale and camaraderie amongst the team.\u201d\u201cOne shift drink is not going to replace the fact that you have no days off, no vacation, and it is hot as fuck in the kitchen,\u201d she adds. \u201cBut it is better than nothing.\u201dBut for all the restaurateurs who have gotten rid of shift drinks and seen positive impacts on their culture, there are owners who have incorporated it in constructive ways.\u201cI want to acknowledge that yes, any business with booze is tricky,\u201d says Kavitha Raghavan, the owner of the wine bar, Indian Paradox, in San Francisco. But shift drinks are okay, she adds, as long as they are framed appropriately. To her, they are an educational tool, since wine is the cornerstone of her establishment. She makes it clear to employees that no one is allowed to drink while there are still customers in the bar. Drinks are poured only when the closing checklist is complete.People have occasionally overdone it, \u201cbut it is not the shift drink policy that is causing the challenges, it is more the person,\u201d she says.Sara Jenkins, chef and owner of Porsena in New York and Nina June in Rockport, Maine, also allows shift drinks. Her policy is strict\u2014everyone gets one drink that is entered into the computer so that she has a log of how many were consumed each night.\u201cIf you completely ban [shift drinks], people will sneak around behind your back,\u201d she says. \u201cI would rather have it out in the open, controlled and monitored and accounted for.\u201dShe adds that the industry often attracts people with a history of substance abuse, and \u201cyou can either encourage that or set a tone where you treat everyone with respect and set firm boundaries,\u201d she says. The conversation shouldn\u2019t be around shift drinks; it should be about leadership and building trust.\u201cThere is this puritanical attitude that alcohol is inherently bad,\u201d she says. \u201cYou have to have an awareness that it can get out of control really fast, but on its basic premise, a shift drink is not a bad thing.\u201dExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishRestaurantsAlcohol & Other DrinksTrendsRead MoreLifestyleAt These Restaurants, Staff Runs Are Replacing Staff Bar NightsBy Priya KrishnaRecipes you want to make.
