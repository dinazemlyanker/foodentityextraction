But I\u2019ve always eaten tacos. They\u2019re the food of champions.As a baby it was soft shell only, because, you know, you could choke. But the first time my family let me eat a hard-shell taco, I was about four or five, and it was a rite of passage. I got to sit with the big people, eat ground beef, tomato, cheese, avocado, and a little bit of lettuce (not a lot because it takes up too much room) on a hard-shell taco with my dad and all my uncles. It was like me and John Wayne.In my early 20s, I got locked up in the San Quentin penitentiary. And there was this guy. I\u2019ll never forget him. If you look up \u201cgangster cholo\u201d in the dictionary, you\u2019ll see his picture. He\u2019d always come by saying, \u201cI got burritos! I got tacos!\u201d Whatever\u2019s in the prison kitchen is what you\u2019re gonna get: ground beef, or if they have hot dogs, a weenie wrapped in a tortilla. \u201cHot dogs, I got hot dogs!\u201d Let me tell you something: When you\u2019re hungry, they're delicious.The first time I got to the joint, he comes by. \u201cTaquitos! Taquitos!\u201d I whistle: \u201cHow much are they, homie?\u201d He tells me in Spanish and I say, \u201cYou know what, I just got out of the hole, homes. I ain\u2019t got no money.\u201d And in unbelievable, perfect English, he goes, \u201cOh, you don\u2019t plan on leaving us soon, do you?\u201d I almost died. Because what he\u2019s saying is, \u201cLook, if you don't pay me later, I\u2019ll kill you.\u201dI\u2019ll never forget that: You might not pay anybody, but the taco guy is the guy you always pay, because you always want to eat.Nobody wields a machete\u2014or makes a taco\u2014like Danny Trejo.\nPhoto by MOSES BERKSONWhen I came out of the institution, I became a drug counselor. In fact, I\u2019m still a drug counselor. I\u2019ll never stop doing that, because you have to give back. But that\u2019s how I ended up in movies; I was a sponsor for a guy working on set, so I started training actors to box. Then I ended up joining the cast. And then another, and another.Back then, as a struggling actor, I was just trying to feed my kids. I\u2019d go study my lines at McDonald\u2019s and put them in that playpen so I could study and not be bothered. Finally, my son came home from school one day\u2014he was about seven\u2014and he says, \u201cDad, you know, you\u2019re killing us.\u201d I said, \"What are you talking about?\" He goes, \u201cWell, the teacher says that McDonald\u2019s is... blah, blah, blah.\u201d So I said, okay, maybe there\u2019s better spots that would cook organic food and chickens that hadn\u2019t been in jail. There are lots of different little restaurants in L.A. that are organic and the meat doesn\u2019t have all kinds of additives. It's just meat. It's grass-fed. You make a taco out of that stuff? It's delicious.Ash Shah was the guy who got me into the restaurant business. I was doing a film called Bad Ass, and he was the producer, and he noticed I\u2019m really picky about food. I won\u2019t eat off just any lunch truck. I know it sounds stupid, but I\u2019m asking the Mexican guy, \"Where do get your meat?\"So Ash said, \u201cDanny, why don\u2019t you start a restaurant?\u201d And jokingly, I said, \u201cTrejo\u2019s Tacos.\u201d And that\u2019s how we got the name. Two movies later he brought me a business plan. Now we\u2019ve got seven taquerias and one donut and coffee shop. We employ second chances at our restaurants\u2014kids who\u2019ve gotten in trouble. People need a job and a chance, that\u2019s all.I don't know how many movies I\u2019ve been in. Maybe about 300? I have a cookbook coming out this month, Trejo\u2019s Tacos. And a record label. And a coffee label. I got beer too. I don\u2019t even drink, but all my friends love it. Next I want to start an acting school. And I still work as a drug counselor, and with autistic kids. You gotta give back. A busy man has time to do everything.The best taco in the world right now, and I challenge anybody, is the carnitas tacos guacamole at Trejo\u2019s Cantina. I'm telling you, man. It\u2019s so tender. We got secret ninja sauce that nobody knows. Remember that show Get Smart? Remember all the doors he used to have to go through? That\u2019s the way you got to get to our kitchen. You got 12 doors to go through, different locks, combinations.My recipes come from my mom and my grandma. My grandma made probably the best guacamole in the world. That\u2019s the same recipe we have at Trejo\u2019s. It\u2019s absolutely delicious, but I can\u2019t tell you what\u2019s in it. I\u2019d have to kill everybody who reads this.Danny Trejo is an actor who has appeared in Hollywood films such as Machete, Heat, Con Air, and Desperado.
