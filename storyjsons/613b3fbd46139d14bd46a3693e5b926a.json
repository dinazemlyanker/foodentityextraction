It\u2019s prepared in stages so the top stays buttery and crisp while the bottom turns into a sort of phyllo bread pudding. This version from baker Samantha Seneviratne is studded with raspberries for bursts of tartness throughout. \u201cThis dessert has so many textural contrasts,\u201d Seneviratne says, \u201cwith crunchy phyllo tops, juicy berries, and creamy custard. Fresh raspberries add a welcome tartness to all the sweetness in the mix.\u201dAll products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Butter an 8\"-diameter or 8x8\" baking dish. Scatter one third of raspberries over bottom of dish.Step 2Place phyllo on a surface; cover with a barely damp kitchen towel. Working with 1 sheet, brush butter over 1 side. Carefully scrunch up to bring long sides together to make a rope, then wrap into a coil. Try not to smash pastry down; you want to keep it tall and somewhat loose. Place in center of prepared pan. Repeat with remaining phyllo and butter, placing coils around the one in the center. Scatter remaining berries over and sprinkle with 1 Tbsp. (13 g) granulated sugar.Step 3Bake until pastry is golden brown and crisp, about 20 minutes.

AnonymousCape May, NJ9/25/2021where is the video????\nAnonymousMinneapolis, MN9/11/2021I followed the instructions and my dessert looked just like the picture, but the center was like glue instead of custard! I baked it for 25 minutes and it tested done- just like the video\u2026.after one piece I threw it out- even my dessert loving hubby wouldn\u2019t eat it. So disappointing.RGDC9/7/2021Wonderful wonderful.  A totally satisfying sweet and sour cake.  It was great for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  The raspberries gave it a sweet and tangy taste which combined with the custard like filling of a Dutch Baby, the satisfaction of a souffl\u00e9, sweet and sour but not too sweet and not too sour.  Thank-you for sharing this recipe with us.  It is a real keeper.Carol FiulNapa9/6/2021It sounds very easy...but not sure about custard part... doesn't  seem like it's cooked enough.But l will try it.\nThank you LizAnonymousnew york9/6/2021now that it's almost fall do you think it will work with apple pieces or ripe pear pieces?elaineNYC9/5/2021Super easy and good - I had a hard time determining how much phyllo to use because the sheets of phyllo in the video looked much larger than the ones I bought \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f if I make it again I need to use may more phyllo PollyMurrieta CA9/2/2021I made this but with fresh blueberries and peaches. It was SO good, light, and pretty quick to pull together especially on a warm summer night! My raw phyllo broke and cracked everywhere because I was impatient with the thawing process (also definitely didn't bother to cover them with anything, just tried to work quickly). I cobbled together \"sheets\" with broken off pieces and just loosely wrapped them together and you honestly couldn't tell the difference in the finished product. So if you are worried about cracked dough, don't be. I also didn't have powdered sugar so added more granulated sugar on the top at the end and it was great, especially with some vanilla ice cream on the side. I'll be making this again with raspberries and adding some basil and lemon to the custard mix. This is definitely a keeper! Alexandra RabeLafayette, CA8/20/2021To Joyce of San Diego and Tina of Darnestown - check out the instructional video by Samantha for this recipe.  A different technique than the written recipe is shown.Anonymous8/15/2021Next time I'd add more sheets of phyllo (I thought I'd be overdoing it) to make sure there are enough crispy bits on top. It didn't take any special techniquie to 'ruffle' the phyllo - get it damp, scrunch it up, softly squeeze it into the pan.\nWorked great in a square 8x8. Didn't have raspberries, strawberries worked very well. Kate CbaPittsburgh, PA8/3/2021This is delicious, I made the mistake of making it in a springform pan though, so a lot of the custard leaked out.  Even still, my family gobbled it up.  I'll definitely make this again (in a proper baking dish!)  next time I will add a bit of lemon zest to the custard to brighten it up just a smidge.  Even if you don't make perfect rosettes with the phyllo it still looks beautiful.  AnonymousNew York8/2/2021Just made this, It's fantastic. wouldn't change a thing. except maybe add more berries to the bottom layer. \noh and my Filo was REALLY thin and delicate, so i doubled up some of my rounds, still came out perfect. TJ7/27/2021Looks great but picture shows ruffled filo on top.  Instructions indicate otherwise.  Am I misreading?\n\nAlso, please cover your unused filo with plastic wrap instead of a damp towel.  No matter how little water there is on the towel it will still muck up the filo.  I\u2019ve been working with filo for over 60 years.
