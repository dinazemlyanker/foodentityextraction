See our past recommendations here!Every time I check on my plants, I talk to them. I encourage them to hang in there! after I notice droopy leaves or brown crusts forming along the edges. I quietly command them to not die as I pinch their stalks, dread washing over me when I realize they\u2019ve turned to mush.These conversations are one-sided, but somehow the tone of them has recently taken a turn. \u201cWow, where did all these leaves come from?\u201d I\u2019ll ask my dwarf ZZ, surprised and impressed that it\u2019s alive. \u201cYou look so good,\u201d I\u2019ll tell my very pink Chinese evergreen that was looking very frail (and crispy?!) just a few months ago. My little chats with my plants are no longer desperate and self-flagellating but an inadvertent pat on the back for me, a former plant noob who has blossomed into an actual plant parent. And it\u2019s all thanks to my GrowLED plant lights.GrowLED Umbrella Plant Grow Light$28 $22 at Amazon$22 at WayfairBefore I owned these lights, zero plants survived living in my apartment. ZERO. Let that sad statistic sink in. As I spent more time at home in the past year, more time reading blogs and following expert greenthumbs on IG, and more time obsessing over my plants, I realized that the biggest threat to them thriving in my apartment was actually a lack of natural light. I clung to this fact partially because it absolved me and partially because it made total sense. My apartment has gigantic windows (10 feet tall!) but it\u2019s gridlocked between office buildings, meaning it gets no direct sunlight and feeble indirect sunlight. Even low-light plants like succulents struggled sitting on my window ledges.So I took matters into my own hands and got a two-pack of these LED lights, mainly because they wouldn't make my apartment look like a rave at night. They come in sleek matte hues (white, blue, yellow!) and are shaped like tiny umbrellas with a dare I say mid-century-modern look. Also, I noticed the keywords \u201cIdeal for Plant Grow Novice\u201d in the item name (GrowLED gets me).The lights are easy to install. You just attach the cord to the lamp itself, connect it to an outlet (get an extension cord if your plants aren\u2019t close to outlets since the GrowLED cord itself is short; less than five feet), plunge the pointed tip of the lamp into your plant\u2019s soil, and you\u2019re done! They come with a timer, if you don\u2019t want to think about turning the lights on and off, but I like to play God, switching the lights on once the sun sets and turning them off before I go to sleep. The light is 4000K, a warm light that is apparently ideal for plants since it has a good amount of blue light for regulating intake of water and carbon dioxide and yellow light for growth (thank you, blogs and plant experts!). The lamp itself is small but has an adjustable height, so it can grow as your plants do.It's been six months since I\u2019ve started using the lights, and they\u2019ve forever changed my work-from-home life. Everyone is thriving.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishHealthyish Loves ItShoppingRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
