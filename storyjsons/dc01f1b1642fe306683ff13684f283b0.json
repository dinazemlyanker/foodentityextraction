Even when I love a place, going back means I\u2019m missing an opportunity to try somewhere new. And as a BA editor with a serious case of FOMO, I always want to try somewhere new.But when I was in Dublin this past summer, Bread 41 made me break my no-repeat rule. I first walked in because my husband suggested it\u2014he read the words \u201clong-fermented sourdough,\u201d \u201corganic ancient grains,\u201d and \u201chouse-milled flour\u201d and figured I\u2019d be interested. (He was right.) Opened last September, it\u2019s the bakery outpost of Bread Nation, baker Eoin Cluskey\u2019s bread wholesale business devoted to top-quality bread made the old-fashioned way. Bread 41 was along the way on our walk from our hotel to St. Stephens Green and, by the time we got there, it was already sold out of bread (it wasn\u2019t even noon!). So I bought a salted chocolate chip cookie made with spelt and fat chocolate discs, and a salted-caramel croissant the size of a baby\u2019s head as consolation and vowed to come back in an hour, when I was told more bread would be out of the oven.Thoughtfully made bread, like this cranberry and poppyseed sourdough, is worth a trip (or two) to Bread 41.\nPhoto by Shannon O' RourkeSixty minutes later, I was wandering the streets of Dublin, pulling hunks of bread from a still-warm miso einkorn loaf. It had a beautiful dark, crunchy crust and a moist, chewy center, with a little kick from the miso that caught you in the back of the throat. And because I was about to leave town\u2014Dublin was a brief stopover on the way to family wedding outside the city\u2014I also bought a chicken banh mi for the road. It was a pretty loose interpretation of a banh mi, but that didn\u2019t bother me as I shoved pillowy housemade milk bread and house-fermented carrots into my mouth.While we were at the wedding, I started thinking about the danishes, which looked so pretty. And the malted loaf, which sounded so interesting. We returned to Dublin with less than 24 hours before our flight back to New York. Plenty of time for another trip to Bread 41 so I could stuff an oat porridge loaf\u2014made with roasted oatmeal!\u2014in my suitcase. What else was I going to do? Try another restaurant? Not when Bread 41 was an option.Go there: Bread 41Explore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendDublinBreadRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
