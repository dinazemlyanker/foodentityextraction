If you sign up for our newsletter, you\u2019ll get her letter before everyone else.It\u2019s birthday central in my family\u2014a bunch of us fall in a neat little row\u2014and usually I\u2019d be at home in Atlanta right about now, ordering cookie cakes and petits fours, buying some cheesy balloons, and trying to pick a restaurant for dinner that will please a handful of people with wildly different tastes. I\u2019ve always been very happy to ignore my own birthday in favor of doing something fun for my loved ones, but this year, when I\u2019m the only part of the \u201cbirthday train\u201d that isn\u2019t back in Atlanta, I\u2019ve decided to at least think about doing it up big.Want this letter before it hits the website?\u00a0Sign up for our newsletter!I\u2019m sensing these camo chocolate fudge brownies in my future...\nPhoto by Laura MurrayOr, well, big for a homebody in a two-person household in the aftermath of a blizzard in the middle of a pandemic, which basically means I bought the ingredients to make an elaborate cake (it has saffron meringue!) in a moment of ambition but have since scaled back my plans to make...I don\u2019t know, maybe some pretty brownies? Or a fun pie, or, like, a more low-key meringue situation? Possibly some scones and a nice tart curd? Should I just buy myself some fancy chocolate and call it a day? Sarah Jampel recommended little berry shortcakes if you don\u2019t want too many leftovers, and Emily Schultz suggested BA\u2019s Best Cheesecake if you want dessert for days after the celebration\u2014or, she says, why not bake a batch of cookies and turn them into ice cream sandwiches?I\u2019m feeling a weird amount of pressure to make something, and it\u2019s kind of stressing me out. I can\u2019t promise I won\u2019t just ignore the whole day or maybe opt for a really cool box mix, but I\u2019d love to hear what you would make (especially if the answer involves cream cheese frosting, my favorite) and how you\u2019re celebrating birthdays at home right now.
