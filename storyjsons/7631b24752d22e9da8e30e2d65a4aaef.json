Delicious side to our salmon, we used champagne vinegar because it was we had. This shaved fennel and peaches blended nicely with grilled salmon. The lemon was a nice balance and we used hatch green Chile flakes, as that is what we have as well. Definitely make again and must make!AnonymousColumbus Ohio6/17/2021Explore Bon App\u00e9titSaladPeachStone FruitFruitFennelVegetableSummerQuickEasySideDairy-FreeGluten-FreeNut-FreeRawVeganVegetarianHealthyishDinnerRecipes you want to make.
