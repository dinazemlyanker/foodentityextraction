This tart was inspired by a tart chef Stefano Secchi of New York City\u2019s Rezd\u00f4ra ate while working in Piedmont, Italy, a region known for the many varieties of cherries available in the spring and summer. For a distinctly Italian variation, use half a packet of Paneangeli Lievito Pane Degli Angeli (a flavored leavening agent you can buy online) in place of the baking powder and vanilla.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.
