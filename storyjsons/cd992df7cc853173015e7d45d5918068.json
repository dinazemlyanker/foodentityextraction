I make x3 the recipe and it\u2019s gone within a week and I\u2019m the only one in my house. Great way to trick yourself into eating more raw veggies. Sometimes I want to just spoon the powder straight into my mouth.AllieJDC10/7/2021I have made this recipe a few times with some substitutions: already roasted pistachios because that is all I can find easily, a small amount of cayenne instead of aleppo because I have it on hand. I'm sure the texture is better using a mortar and pestle, but I can make it so fast in my tiny food processor. It comes together in minutes and makes eating fresh veggies way more delicious. AnonymousRochester, NY4/21/2021This is one of my most favourite recipes ever! I don\u2019t have pistachio money so I subbed about 2/3 pumpkin seeds 1/3 walnuts, so much cheaper and sooooo tasty!Deanna Eliot2/6/2021THIS. STUFF. IS. ADDICTIVE. \n\nIt\u2019s the best thing I\u2019ve made from Bon App\u00e9tit ever. I can\u2019t get enough!! I want to eat it by the spoonful! I will never go back to plain veggies again. Ohioan10/23/2020My kids are obsessed with this. It's a great way to make veggies more fun. Thanks, Sohla. Love you!AnonymousGlenville8/26/2020I was out of pistachios so I substituted almonds. It worked pretty well even though I didn't grind the nuts quite fine enough.\nI'm looking forward to trying some more variations of this idea :)paintgirl213554Victoria BC Canada8/3/2020My roommate is allergic to pistachios so I made this with almonds and it is still so good! I want to put it on everything. AnonymousMinneapolis, MN7/29/2020Can I replace pistachios with another nut?\n\nMade this with pistachios and we're already out!AnonymousHouston, TX6/13/2020This is so good.  I lacked the nooch so I replaced it with a little MSG and some tomato powder.  Same idea and it came out great.  I also used a bag of roasted, salted pistachios in my freezer.  Next time I'll follow it to the letter, but I love the bones of this idea and I'm probably going to use it for other applications.  I can see sprinkling this stuff on sandwiches, over soups, you name it.  It's great!Anonymous6/10/2020realizing now that I left out the sugar by mistake, but this is still phenomenal! I hadn't eaten lunch yet, so when I finished making it I sliced some radishes and cucumbers and tore up some pressed tofu, drizzled them with olive oil and a spritz of lemon juice, and then sprinkled the whole plate liberally with the fun dip. This may be a new go-to lunch salad! AbbyRAlabama6/7/2020Such a fun concept but next time I will use less salt and more dill! AnonymousToronto 6/5/2020So dang good!! I made mine in a blender and it worked fine. I couldn\u2019t find Aleppo pepper so I used a combo of smoked paprika and cayenne. This actually made carrots taste good. I\u2019ll totally be making this again. kristi.ellisGeorgetown, Texas6/4/2020I really enjoyed this! I quickly pulsed everything in the food processor to bring it all together. It is delicious on EVERYTHING from veggies, to chunks of turkey from a P3 snack pack. Sugar_PiesKnoxville5/23/2020I do not know if using already roasted pistachios, or the brand of nutritional yeast was the problem. But this is awful.Thornhill BC5/22/2020Such a great and simple idea!
