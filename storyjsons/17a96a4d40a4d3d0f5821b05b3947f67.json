A can of chickpeas or white beans are not unwelcome here. Bulk up with a mixture of little gem lettuce and radicchio. Perfect for those summer nights when it's too hot to turn on the stove! Serve with a light, chilled red or an ice-cold beer. Delish!JamieSan Francisco7/8/2021Absolutely hands down the best Antipasto recipe. Made this recipe multiple times- works well with shallot in place of the red onion too!WARWICK, NY7/23/2019Omitted the Basil only because I forgot it at the store, used a little less onion, and it was amazing. The dressing reminded me of growing up as I was raised on red wine vinaigrette\u2019s.\nWill add this to my go too\u2019s.\nThanksAnonymousBenicia, CA6/16/2019I liked this salad waaaaay more than I thought I would.  Italian peppers were a trick to find (I have a good grocer but they were pretty picked over) and I wanted something with a bit more flavor than just yellow/orange/red peppers.  I admit, it's Hatch chile season and I was tempted to use a mild one, but wasn't brave enough this first time around!  So I picked up a good orange pepper, then grabbed a jar each of cherry and banana peppers and diced some of those in---normally am not a fan but they did super well in this recipe---just be sure to give them a quick rinse to get the excess vinegar off after cutting since you already have it in the dressing here.AnonymousHouston8/19/2018This is a winner!  the flavors are bright and flavorful.  The only thing I changed is that I used sliced roasted red peppers from a jar.  The cubanelle peppers didn't do much for me.  I also added a chopped plum tomato since I had it on hand.  The dressing is perfect and lent a great flavor to the dish.  It also makes a great sandwich on a ciabatta roll with lettuce leaves on each side to keep it from getting soggy.  I can't wait to make it again!AnonymousLower Hudson Valley8/4/2018Explore Bon App\u00e9titSaladItalianEuropeanRed OnionOnionVegetableArtichokeMozzarellaCheeseSalamiCured MeatMeatSummerQuickEasySideGluten-FreeNut-FreeKetoLunchDinnerRecipes you want to make.
