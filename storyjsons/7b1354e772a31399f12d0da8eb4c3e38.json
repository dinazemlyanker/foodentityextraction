Gravy is your dry-bird insurance plan (knock on wood) and there\u2019s bound to be a guest or two who\u2019ll be disappointed if it\u2019s not on the table. So take the time to pick your gravy strategy carefully: Depending on what kind of cook you are, gravy can be a hasty affair, pulled together in the final hour, or a laborious multistep process involving a long-simmering from-scratch stock. It doesn\u2019t always have to include a whole bird hot from the oven, an expertly cooked roux, or the giblets\u2014but, then again, it can if you want!\u00a0We\u2019ve sifted through the many, many turkey gravy recipes in the archives to pull out the best option depending on how much time you have and how seriously you take your gravy.For the OverachieverIf you\u2019re truly looking to impress, and if gravy gets the star treatment on your table, this classic silky, rich make-ahead gravy is the labor-of-love route to take this year.\u00a0Instead of a speedier pan sauce method that relies on turkey drippings (more on that later), you\u2019ll start by making from-scratch turkey stock using chicken and turkey wings, crimini mushrooms, and smoked ham hock. Then you\u2019ll simmer that stock down with more browned chicken wings, aromatic vegetables, herbs, and dry white wine before thickening it with roux. The result: layers of flavor, impeccable silkiness, and, when you tell your guests that every bit is from scratch, a major wow factor.Give yourself plenty of time for this: The turkey stock can be made a couple of days in advance and you can make the finished gravy a few days before serving as well, which will free up another burner on the big day.\u00a0While it\u2019s certainly a project, depending on how you like to prepare for guests (looking at all of you Type A\u2019s, Virgos, and Ravenclaws), this can be less stressful than pondering how to make gravy after you\u2019ve roasted your turkey\u2014and when guests are walking in the door.Make-Ahead GravyThis do-ahead gravy skips the pan drippings.View RecipeFor the \u201cPlay It by Ear\u201d HostIf you\u2019re not quite an over-preparer and not quite a procrastinator, Why-Is-It-So-Good Gravy is your answer. It\u2019s an impressive, reliable gravy recipe you can make from scratch without too much stress.\u00a0Instead of pan drippings, from-scratch stock, or roux, this rich, crowd-pleasing favorite is founded in roasted turkey (or chicken) wings, ginger, peppercorns, garlic, shallots, mushrooms, and the umami powerhouse known as MSG.The best part: You can feasibly whip it up the day of the dinner or decide to take care of it the day before\u2014just leave out the vinegar and MSG if you}re planning to go the make-ahead route. You\u2019ll want to add those last as you\u2019re reheating the gravy.\u00a0Why-Is-It-So-Good GravyA make-ahead gravy gets a remarkable depth of flavor from roasted poultry bones and\u2014surprise!\u2014a sprinkle of MSG.View RecipeFor the Last-Minute CookIf working days in advance isn\u2019t quite your style, we recommend an easy gravy recipe that starts with a pan sauce made right in your roasting pan when the bird is resting. This Classic Turkey Gravy with Thyme goes fast\u2014from pan to table you\u2019re looking at about 20 minutes, tops. And with only six ingredients, it\u2019s about as speedy and simple as a gravy can get but with zero compromises on depth and flavor.Since you\u2019re not spending as much time on layering the flavors in this method, you\u2019ll want to splurge on high-quality store-bought poultry stock and take the time to develop a deep golden brown roux. You can easily use all-purpose flour here in a pinch, but Wondra, which is more finely ground, makes for an extra silky sauce and is worth seeking out.Classic Turkey Gravy with ThymeView RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titThanksgivingcookingRecipes you want to make.
