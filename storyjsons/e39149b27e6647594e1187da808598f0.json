This dry-brined turkey recipe requires an early start on Thanksgiving day, but no prep leading up to the holiday\u2014unlike wet brines, which can take up to 72 hours (and create a lot more mess). The dry brine is a salty mixture rubbed all over the turkey and allowed to sink in, in this case 6\u20137 hours, delivering big flavor with minimal hassle. Choose your own adventure and pick out a dry brine to match your menu: There\u2019s bright Citrus and Peppercorn, traditional and versatile Garlic and Herb, or Fennel, Chile, and Maple, which tempers heat with sweetness.Leftovers from a dry-brined turkey breast won\u2019t disappoint. Try using them to make a French Toast Sandwich, Turkey Posole, or Spicy Cabbage Salad with Turkey and Peanuts.Editor\u2019s note: This recipe was originally published October 15, 2013..Ingredients8 to 10 ServingsCitrus and Peppercorn Dry Brine, Garlic and Herb Dry Brine, or Fennel, Chile, and Maple Dry Brine112\u201314-lb. turkey, giblets and neck removed1medium onion, quartered1head of garlic, halved1\u20132bunches of herbs\u00bccup (\u00bd stick) unsalted butter, room temperature2cups (or more) low-sodium chicken brothPreparationStep 1Rub dry brine all over turkey; chill uncovered, 6\u20137 hours.Step 2Preheat oven to 425\u00b0.

I love it!SunnieSeattle, WA11/14/2021Love this recipe, but the cook temp is off.  325 just isn't enough.  Opt for 350 if you want to eat without a family revoltRory PWashington, DC11/26/2020Have made this every year since the Nov 2013 issue, using the maple, Chile, fennel brine.  Comes out great each time, and the pan gravy from it is awesome!MQuastPhoenix AZ11/26/2020It's a classic for a reason. This is my go-to Thanksgiving turkey. Used the Fennel, Chile, and Maple Dry Brine last year and had zero regrets.  rskartenNew York10/31/2017Explore Bon App\u00e9titTurkeyPoultryMainNut-FreeGluten-FreeKetoRoastThanksgivingDinnerRecipes you want to make.
