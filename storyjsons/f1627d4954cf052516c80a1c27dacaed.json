Fresh oregano, parsley, and cilantro come together with a heavy pour of red wine vinegar for a punchy condiment that\u2019s as good spooned over a grilled steak as it is drizzled on a bowl of lentils (it\u2019s also an excellent marinade).Chopping everything by hand (as opposed to using a food processor) gives you dynamic texture\u2014and prevents the herby sauce from turning into a paste. Allowing the shallot, chile, garlic, and salt to sit with the vinegar for 10 minutes before adding the herbs softens the aromatics and tames their raw sting.Chimichurri is best served just after it\u2019s made, but if you have any left over, the sauce will hold in the refrigerator for a few days. Use to top roasted chicken, grilled tofu, oven-roasted potatoes, fried eggs, or almost anything else that\u2019s simply seasoned. Mix it with Greek yogurt to create a dip, or work in a bit of mayonnaise for a creamy and herb-packed spread for a sandwich.Editor\u2019s note: This recipe was originally published in our July 2011 issue.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

AnonymousBlue Bell PA1/27/2022This is the worst recipe ever. 1/2 cup of red wine vinegar??? It's waaaay too strong. The next most popular recipe uses 2 tablespoons...Anonymous1/13/2022This is absolutely delicious over roasted cauliflower.AnonymousSilicon Valley11/5/2021This leaves an after taste delicious AnonymousUk7/31/2021Far better than any Jared sauce that you can purchase! Marcos RodriguezBoca Raton, Florida 7/25/2021Was spectacular!  Love love love!  Telling all my friends about it. Can marinade anything with this -beef, pork, chicken or fish and absolutely can use as a side dipping sauce.  Thank you for sharing!!!Carolina4evr7/8/2021Absolutely devine!  I used fresh ingredients from my garden  and it was excellent. \nThank you.Kelly macia Seabrook  sc 6/26/2021Made this and the amount of vinegar was way too over powering. It ruined it. I will add to taste The next time.Larry GAltadena ,CA6/24/2021I was first introduced to Chimichurri at Texas de Brazil....it was good.  Now, I make my own, and it goes great with any meat but especially beef.\n\nOne person who posted a review mentioned that the Red Wine vinegar was over power...that maybe true but I mix half Red Wine and half (ready for this?) White Raspberry  Balsamic vinegar.  Of course,  any Balsamic would work.   Less intense than straight vinegar and a touch of sweetness.\nRoyQuitman, TX6/11/2021Amazing! So delicious. Great burn/acid/flavor combination. We used that for a traditional Argentine choripan. Roxana Wroblewski Argentine and Texas 5/30/2021Love it! Thank you. We\u2019ve made this 4x now and are big fans. I\u2019m not sure if this is a traditional way of making it, but it\u2019s super delicious. My husband is very picky and loves it. We use it on grilled chicken, steak and rice. The acidity is amazing to brighten up a dish. Jen Calgary, AB5/12/2021AMAZING, love this sauce. I've made it countless times! Simple and fresh and pairs well with any type of grilled meat. I specifically like pairing it with picanha or top sirloin.Nicole RToronto, ON5/11/2021Read an article about chimichurri sauce, how it's best if chopped, rustically, rather than processed, so when I made this recipe, I chopped all the ingredients.  \nIt was DEE-licious!  \nMost recipes contained oregano, only this one used cilantro and it adds depth and another layer of 'fresh' taste to the sauce.\nThe amount of red vinegar might not be to everyone's taste, but with a fatty piece of meat, the acid is a perfect counter-balance.\nGreat recipe, we loved it.eatumlotsIrvine, CA5/10/2021A great recipe! It worked perfectly and was the perfect accompaniment to our steak and shrimp lunch. I made it with the red, deseeded chilli option. For the oil I opted for Filippo Berrio extra Virgin. I wasn\u2019t sure about whether the quantity of parsley and cilantro was \u2018packed\u2019 or after chopping so i did it by taste. It was super, I\u2019m definitely making this again!
