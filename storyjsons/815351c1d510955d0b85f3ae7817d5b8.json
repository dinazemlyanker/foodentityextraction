It\u2019s a mushroom-heavy soup spiced with Hungarian paprika, dill, and thyme. This soup just hits the spot on a cold night. There are a number of variations that include pasta, turnips, soup dumplings, and more. This recipe, however, is a simple version that includes milk for a creamy, rich texture. Feel free to substitute the paprika with garam masala and a pinch of turmeric and chili powder for a spicier Indian-style soup. You can also use plant-based butter and vegan sour cream to make this soup vegan. \u2014Hetal VasavadaAll products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

We loved it. Definitely will make it again.M. HargateCleveland1/3/2022I'm a novice chef and this was really good!! Followed the recipe exactly except that I halved it and didn't add any salt to the onions or to taste at the end - it was perfect! I would leave the carrots out next time though, the mushy texture didn't add anything for me. Anonymous12/25/2021Super delicious. I didn\u2019t have any dill unfortunately, but it still turned out great. If you\u2019re sensitive to spice, perhaps start with half of the paprika and add as needed - it\u2019s pretty spicy. It paired really well with yeasty dinner rolls and extra sour cream. MelissaGreenville, SC12/23/2021The other review is a bit odd, definitely don't add less broth! Based on the image, it's already a bit thicker than it usually is in Hungary. However, all the components are legit, I expect this soup to be delicious. And no, you can't just skip onions in a Hungarian recipe, onion is pretty much the foundation of all Hungarian cuisine :D I wouldn't use shiitake though, the standard Hungarian mushroom used is csiperke. Gabor VBudapest, Hungary12/19/2021Really liked this recipe.  I'll make it again. Delicious.  The instructions didn't mention adding the parsley, so eventually I put that in the pot.  I also added Mrs. Dash, and T. Joe's Umami seasoning.  I'm sending the recipe to a few friends who I think will like making and eating this.cheryl hIrvine, CA6/5/2021Loved this recipe!! Took me so long to prepare but it was so creamy and delicious. Freezes well too so I would make a big batch to save for later. Jennifer ILos Angeles 5/1/2021OHHHHHHHH... Thank you for this recipe - the videos really help.  \n\nNot only have I found a delicious soup that I want to keep making (and perfecting) but also, as a basic skills cook, now feel like I have also learnt some additional cooking techniques.\n\nEnjoyed this cooking tutorial and for me the flavours blended really well.   Used dried tarragon as had no dill so also added a smidge of fennel seed and turned out really tasty and would happily serve to friends and family.    \n\nFantastic to find a recipe that works for me!  THANK YOU  X  Will be back for more XAJLincoln - UK3/30/2021This is really good.  I followed the recipe.  I would suggest adding less vegetable broth or at least add four cups and add more if it seems it needs it later.  Still, I will definitely make it again.  Definitely better to add more vegetables than less; everything cooks down.  This may just be a personal preference as I like my soup substantial and not too soupy.  Really, really good.  Served with sliced French bread with butter.Phil Thompson  Effingham, Illinois3/19/2021I really want to make this, but I cannot eat onions or garlic and every BA recipe includes onions and garlic but this is one of the worst I've seen. There is absolutely no way that I can modify this one. I'm really sad, Hungarian mushroom soup was a staple in my college town and I have so wanted to make it for myself to bring back the memories.Mari K-CGrand Rapids, MI3/5/2021Is the parsley only garnish at the end of is the 1/4 added to the soup?Anonymous3/1/2021This soup is delicious!   I diced the mushrooms as I\u2019m recovering from surgery and can\u2019t chew.  Turned out SO good.  I will definitely keep this recipe and will be making this again.
