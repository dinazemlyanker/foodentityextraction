Well, That DependsChoosing the right cooking fat for the job is key. We\u2019re here to help.By Nico AvalleAugust 2, 2021FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Joseph DeLeo\u00a0FacebookTwitterEmailYou have a lot of options when choosing a cooking fat for a dish and each choice comes with its own unique perks and benefits. Take this recipe for Cod With Scallion-Sesame Butter, which includes not one, not two, but three fats, each with a specific purpose. There\u2019s olive oil for searing, butter for richness, and toasted sesame oil for added warmth and flavor. \u201cRegardless of what kind of dish I\u2019m cooking, I\u2019m always looking to maximize flavor from every ingredient,\u201d says Test Kitchen director Chris Morocco, who developed the recipe. \u201cIt\u2019s not about having an oily end product, but more about the different aromas and flavors each fat brings to the table.\u201dBy that same token, individual cooking fats also come with their own limitations\u2014from smoking points to flavors and consistencies that may or not be welcome in a particular situation\u2014which make choosing the right one all the more important. To help you make the right decision at home, we asked members of our Test Kitchen how they go about choosing fats when cooking. And while none of these are hard and fast rules, asking yourself these questions before reaching for a stick of butter or a bottle of oil will help set you on the best path forward.Is fat the star of the show?Fat is essential for making almost anything taste delicious (thank you, Samin Nostrat), but that doesn\u2019t mean you always want it to be the center of attention. Unlike more fragrant fats like coconut or olive oil, neutral oils don\u2019t bring a lot of flavor to the table on their own. Associate food editor Rachel Gurjar considers that a huge selling point when making infusions like chile crisp or oil-based pickles. In these cases, the oil is a carrier for other ingredients, so you don\u2019t want it to steal the spotlight. \u201cWhen you use something like olive oil, the fat itself is going to taste so strong,\u201d she says, \u201cwhile something like a neutral oil would simply absorb the flavors and the colors that you add instead.\u201dIn that sense, you can think of neutral oil as a blank canvas: bursting with potential, but boring as hell on its own. When a dish is fat-forward or if the ingredient list is short and simple, you want to make sure the fat you choose is something you\u2019ll actually want to taste, whether it\u2019s a subtle and peppery glug of extra-virgin olive oil or something as bold as toasted sesame oil. \u201cI will almost never use neutral oil in a salad dressing because I see that as a wasted opportunity to use something more flavorful,\u201d Chris explains.Butter is another fat that brings a lot of it\u2019s own character to a dish. \u201cWhile it\u2019s carrying flavor, it\u2019s imparting flavor as well,\u201d says senior food editor Andy Baraghani. Just think of garlic and herb butter: while the aromatics and fresh greens are welcome members of the ensemble, we all know who we came here to see.How (and when) will it be served?There\u2019s a reason we geek out over olive oil cakes and it has everything to do with saturation. \u201cOlive oil is going to maintain its fluidity at room temperature and enhance the sense of moisture even after the cake cools,\u201d says Chris. That\u2019s why baked goods made with unsaturated fats like neutral oil or olive oil dry out much more slowly compared to a buttery cake, even when sitting on the counter: butter and other saturated fats like coconut oil want to solidify.The same holds for savory foods. A pat of butter added to a ribeye right before serving can be delicious while the steak is hot, but Chris points out that the perfection doesn\u2019t last. \u201cThat\u2019s luscious and compelling for the first 20 minutes it\u2019s on the plate,\u201d he says, \u201cbut maybe at 25 minutes, when the butter starts to congeal, it starts to suck.\u201d Heat (or the lack thereof) transforms the texture of butter, and keeping that change in mind can be the difference between something that\u2019s creamy and rich and something that\u2019s seized up and greasy.Can it stand the heat?Just like we all have a breaking point, every oil has its smoking point. For olive and unrefined coconut oil, this occurs around the 300-350\u00b0F range. For most neutral oils, by contrast, you\u2019re looking at temperatures well above 400\u00b0F. These are the heat ranges where extreme transformations like Maillard reactions and caramelization can take place, which makes these oils great candidates for tasks like searing steaks and other thick cuts of meat (try that in butter and the butter will burn long before your ribeye takes on a hearty sear).When whole butter hits 212\u00b0F, it\u2019s going to transform in a completely different way. First, its moisture is going to evaporate, leaving behind just milk solids and fat, then the solids are going to begin toasting and browning, creating brown butter. \u201cBrown butter is magical,\u201d says Rachel, \u201cbut because it\u2019s so flavorful, the simpler you keep it, the tastier it\u2019s going to be.\u201d If you\u2019ve ever had a simple brown butter and sage sauce, you\u2019ll know exactly what she\u2019s talking about.How to have it allSometimes you just need the flavor of butter, but don\u2019t want your dish to taste burnt, and that\u2019s okay! If you brown butter before straining out the milk solids, you\u2019ll be left with ghee, a form of clarified butter frequently used in South Asian cooking. \u201cEven though you\u2019re taking out the solids, there is a distinct flavor that you can taste from the butter you started with,\u201d says Rachel while explaining why she starts with high quality butter when making ghee at home. Ghee\u2019s smoke point is comparable to olive oil, making it perfect for blooming spices for things like chhonk and tadka.Depending on the context, mixing fats is also a great option. \u201cIf I\u2019m cooking steak,\u201d Rachel explains,\u201d I will always use butter and oil from the start because I want the best of both worlds: I want butter to add the toasty, caramelly notes it gains when it browns to the steak, but I also want to keep the butter from burning.\u201dThat method works best if you\u2019re trying to add brown butter flavor to a high-heat application, but if you want whole butter flavor without the nuttiness, Andy suggests adding it later on in the cooking process, when it won\u2019t be cooked for long enough to remove its velvety consistency. \u201cWhen I\u2019m finishing a pasta that I\u2019ve built with oil, the butter and the pasta water I add at the end helps the sauce that cling onto the pasta as well, so that they come together and aren\u2019t two separate entities.\u201dThe same holds for meat and seafood as well: butter and flavorful oils like toasted sesame, which don\u2019t hold up well to high heat, can bring a last minute punch of flavor and richness to a protein cooked in a more neutral fat. \u201cI\u2019d absolutely make an argument for including some kind of fat as a finishing element in a dish,\u201d says Chris, \u201cthere\u2019s no joy in having a pool of neutral oil on the plate, but butter can be a completely delicious addition.\u201dExplore Bon App\u00e9titcookingFarmers Market ChallengeRecipes you want to make.
