WAY too much liquid in both the oatmeal and compote- I wish I would have read the reviews. It doesn\u2019t look anything like the picture, as I ended up with pink applesauce and soupy oatmeal. Anonymous11/18/2019Not tasty. Sauce turns to mush really quickly, maybe don't add the apples until the last possible second?leylusha4/9/2019Made this but heeded the comments about too much liquid! Used hazelnut milk and ghee to make it dairy-free and included 2c of \"milk\" instead of the suggested 4 1/2c. Came out like a dream and I was able to cut into squares, wrap in parchment paper, and eat on my way to work. Anonymous1/14/2019With saut\u00e9ed apples and greek yogurt, it tastes like a healthy deconstructed apple pie. I made this with half almond milk- half regular milk, topped with toasted, caramelized walnuts and heavy handed with the spices... Just scrumptious!! I ate the entire pan in two days. Fricken delightful. moo cocoBrooklyn1/4/2019Made this exactly as written. At 40mins baking, the oatmeal was still soupy. Not sure what I did wrong but it never absorbed the 4 1/4 cups of milk even after another 20mins or so. Golden top sure. But soupy underneath. Tasted good and I\u2019ll reduce the milk content next time. Anonymous12/3/2018My family loved this!!! I don\u2019t care for oatmeal and I loved it.  We can\u2019t wait for the weekend to make it again.  Delicious! BHFFlorida11/26/2018I haven't made the recipe yet.  On Wednesday I had Baked Oatmeal at the Refectory Cafe in Durham, North Carolina.  It was amazing.  They said that they made it the night before and let it sit overnight to soak up the liquid ingredients and then baked it with peaches the next morning. I would love that recipe.  Have you ever made it using that technique?  Could this recipe be adapted to be made that way?AnonymousVirginia Beach11/24/2018Explore Bon App\u00e9titAppleFruitCranberryBerryOatRice & GrainsYogurtOther IngredientsDairy-FreeGluten-FreeVegetarianHealthyishThanksgivingBreakfastRecipes you want to make.
