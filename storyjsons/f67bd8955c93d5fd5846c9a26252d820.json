Make sure you pronounce it correctly, as in \u201ckoons.\u201d Then, proceed with any of the following tasks: Artfully drizzle dressing over some crisp endive leaves; baste herby juices over a roasted chicken; flip, stir, sauce, plate whatever\u2019s in front of you\u2014oh, and taste it too.Just like freshly glued press-on nails used to make me feel like a kid instantly transformed into an adult, holding a Kunz spoon gives me that line-ready cook confidence\u2014even if I\u2019m just putting together some breakfast alone in my tiny kitchen. And there\u2019s a reason why the real deal, including food editors in the Bon App\u00e9tit Test Kitchen, has at least one of these lying around at all times.\u201cSome people might look at them and think they\u2019re soup spoons or serving spoons, but no, they\u2019re cooking utensils,\u201d says senior food editor Anna Stockwell, who keeps hers at home by the stove, where she can get to it faster than if it were tucked inside a drawer. For spooning sauces, scooping contents from a pot to a plate, or pulling a fillet of fish from off out of a pan, \u201cthere\u2019s no better option than the Kunz spoon.\u201d\u201cYou start to notice with most spoons, that in order to get a deep enough bowl to actually be useful as a serving spoon, you very quickly graduate to this big flat spoon,\u201d senior food editor Chris Morocco added, showing me a series of subpar spoons that even with a lot of surface area, hardly hold a teaspoon of liquid. This one has the depth, angle, and edges to get any job done. Plus, he says, \u201cIt feels really nice in the hand. That\u2019s what it\u2019s all about.\u201dThe late Gray Kunz, chef and restaurateur who formerly ran the kitchen at New York\u2019s Lespinasse, made sure of it. Frustrated that one utensil couldn\u2019t satisfy all his needs, he engineered his namesake tool with all these different use cases in mind. The deep bowl, with its slightly tapered edge, holds 2.5 tablespoons; the handle, short and narrow, is easy to control; the weight\u2014perfectly balanced, and just heavy enough to maneuver with precision\u2014all make it the One Spoon to Rule Them All. He began manufacturing them in the late \u201990s, and after becoming available at J.B. Prince kitchen supply store, they quickly made their way into the hands of cooks throughout the restaurant industry.The Gray Kunz Spoon in action.\nChef Hugh Acheson won\u2019t travel without two Gray Kunz spoons in his carry-on. Carla Lalli Music likes to give them as gifts, especially the fancier limited-edition copper version. Danny Bowien prefers his in gold. They also now come in small and XL, and with perforations if you want your spoon to double as a strainer.Take your pick. No matter what, it\u2019s still the perfect spoon for everything you need accomplished in the kitchen.Buy it: J.B.
