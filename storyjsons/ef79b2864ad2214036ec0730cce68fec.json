(A good vegetarian meatball? THESE, FRIENDS!)Read \u201cIs it ever okay\u2026?\u201d right this wayThat\u2019s one way to do itThis week, a video went viral of U.S. Senator Mitt Romney removing each individual candle on his birthday cake and huffing and puffing it out. This is called \u201cthe wish-extender,\u201d a birthday loophole practiced by the few and the brave (you really shouldn\u2019t mess with birthday magic). It\u2019s bold, it\u2019s a little odd, but it\u2019s also hygienic. We\u2019ll only know how effective it is if, in the next few months, Romney retires to a ranch in Utah, takes up porch-sitting and crosswords, wins the lottery, learns Spanish, finally finishes The Power Broker, meets Beyonc\u00e9, fits into those old jeans again, and finds some peace and quiet in this wild, crazy world.Want this letter before it hits the website? Sign up for our newsletter!The other viral thingWas this video of a pineapple being eaten one spike at a time. \u201cWait, is this is how we should\u2019ve been eating it all along?\u201d the collective internet asked. So BA\u2019s social media duo Rachel Karten and Emily Schultz went to Whole Foods and asked the Test Kitchen editors to assist. Chris Morocco \u201cdid his whole Chris thought-process thing,\u201d said Emily, and he told them to score the pineapple with a knife first. Instead they followed the video, cut off the pineapple top, and tried to pull off wedges. It didn\u2019t work. Next, Emily scored it, but she didn\u2019t do an accurate job so it didn\u2019t work and \u201cRachel was mad.\u201d The second pineapple was accidentally cut through the core\u2014another failure. \u201cWe think it was a different type of pineapple in the video, one without a core,\u201d Emily concluded. Uhhhh.Courtesy of NightfoodGood night, sweet creamThis week I sampled a Brand New Snack Product. It was a healthy-ish, lower sugar, lower calorie ice cream that \u201cpromotes\u201d better sleep called Nightfood. Does it make you sleepy? Nope. Does it fight the debts, deadlines, and demons keeping you up at night? Sadly nope. Does it contain \u201cglycine\u201d? Yes! Not sure what that is? It\u2019s an amino acid that contributes to a good night\u2019s sleep. I liked the Bed and Breakfast flavor, a hint of maple cream ice cream with little cookie dough-esque pieces of waffle, and the wonderfully unsweet decaf coffee flavor. One thing is undeniably true: These are much better than another lower calorie ice cream I SHALL NOT NAME.Speaking of caloriesI read a fantastic longread this week in 1843, The Economist\u2019s lifestyle magazine (which I\u2019d never heard of until the publicist sent me the promo for). \u201cThe Death of the Calorie\u201d is about how we\u2019ve been misperceiving calories all this time, how often the calorie count listed on foodstuffs is inaccurate, and all kinds of facts that made me want to eat more greens. However, I am currently eating Cheez-Its off a large plate I call my \u201cchip plate.\u201d Which brings me to...Photo by Heidi's Bridge, styling by Anna BillingskogThis dip saves marriagesAt least according to one reviewer, \u201cBHURLOW,\u201d who wrote \u201cthis dip literally saved my marriage.\u201d I\u2019d love to know the whole story, so if you\u2019re out there, BHURLOW, fill me in!Get the recipe: French Onion DipUnnecessary food meme of the weekUnnecessary food feud of the week\u201cIs Life a good cereal?\u201d Now imagine a chorus of YESNO belting out in beautiful cacophony. \u201cThey get soggy before you can even put a spoon in it,\u201d said Amiel Stanek. \u201cSo you need a spoon in one hand, milk in the other, and then you gotta eat it fast.\u201d Alex Delany agreed, \u201cThere\u2019s a milk application process, for sure,\u201d and then sent me a 210 word exposition on why Life is a good cereal, which I refuse to share here. It begins with \u201cyou have to come from a place of cereal humility to appreciate it.\u201d To me, Life, the cereal, is as torturous as Life, the game, and Life, the life. Cristina Martinez felt that \u201conly people who eat Triscuits could like Life cereal,\u201d which perked up Aliza Abarbanel, who is a Triscuit-loving Life appreciator. Meryl Rothstein emerged from a pile of red-penciled papers and proclaimed, \u201cLife is a fine cereal.\u201dExplore Bon App\u00e9titBeggs NewsletterRead MorecultureIs It Ever Okay...To Call Out a Mansplaining Waiter?By Alex BeggsRecipes you want to make.
