We love a mix of clementines, ricotta salata, and pistachios for winter; Bosc or D\u2019Anjou pears, parmesan, and hazelnuts for fall; persimmon, mild blue cheese, and pecans for spring; and figs, honey toasted walnuts, and Manchego for summer. Ideally, let everything sit for 15 minutes before serving, so the fruit juices can mingle with the dressing on the plate. This recipe is from Where Cooking Begins by Carla Lalli Music.Ingredients4 servings \u00bdcup coarsely chopped nuts3Tbsp. (or more) extra-virgin olive oil1Tbsp. (or more) honeyKosher salt, freshly ground pepper2tsp. (or more) unseasoned rice vinegar, divided6oz. semi-firm, salty cheese1\u00bdlb. ripe fruitPreparationStep 1Combine nuts and oil in a small skillet and set over medium heat. Cook, stirring often, until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and mix in honey; season with salt and lots of pepper. Add 1 tsp. vinegar. Dressing should be sweet and fatty and lip-smacky and spiced. Adjust with more oil, honey, salt, pepper, and/or vinegar until you\u2019re pleased.Step 2Break up cheese into pieces or thinly slice, as you wish. Cut fruit into \u00bc\"-thick wedges or rounds and place on a platter or large plate. Sprinkle with salt and drizzle with remaining 1 tsp. vinegar. Tuck in pieces of cheese; spoon dressing over (heat over low if needed to loosen).How would you rate Fresh Fruit with Cheese and Peppery Nuts?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (4)Back to TopTriangleUpdate to my previous comment...  We continue to make this for friends and family, and it has affectionately been renamed \"Fruit Nachos\".  Mike T. Brooklyn, NY3/29/2021I've made this multiple times for simple (yet seemingly extravagant) appetizers at dinner parties, and it's been a hit every time.  I've used pears, persimmons, and kiwis (possibly my favorite).  You can pretty much mix and match nuts and cheeses, and you can't really go wrong.  Plus it looks great. Thanks BA!Mike T. Brooklyn, NY1/18/2021Honestly can't believe how delicious this was. Because we don't have figs readily available, I made a version with ripe peaches, a mild blue cheese and pecans. It looks beautiful, tastes amazing and is relatively effortless. Such a great alternative to a cheese board for a dinner party. AnonymousTexas6/29/2019This is SO good!! My combo was pistachios, feta and oranges - I also threw in some baby spinach to bulk it up. The dressing is so delicious and quick to throw together. Definitely going to be making this again, can't wait to try other fruit/cheese combos.AnonymousCanada3/15/2019Explore Bon App\u00e9titSaladCheeseClementineCitrusFruitRicotta SalataRicottaPistachioNutPearParmesanHazelnutPersimmonBlue CheesePecanFigWalnutManchegoSpringSummerFallWinterEasyStarterSideGluten-FreeVegetarianHealthyishLunchDinnerRecipes you want to make.
