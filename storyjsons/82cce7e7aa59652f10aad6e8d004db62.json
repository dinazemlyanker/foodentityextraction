I have a short attention span and a need for novelty (today was toast with mackerel, yesterday was fried bulgur with turkey bacon, wow). So when the PR team behind Yishi\u2019s Taro Bubble Tea Oatmeal was like, do you want to try these new ~functional~ oats, I was like, YES.And I\u2019m glad I did, because it\u2019s delicious. The base is a combination of organic gluten-free oats, flax and hemp seeds, and almonds, all ground to a sandy powder that makes the texture of the oatmeal creamy and able to cook quickly. There\u2019s some crunch from the seeds, but I add extra chia seeds for even more protein and texture.In the taro version, there\u2019s powdered black tea (which helps you focus/stay alert because you\u2019re, well, caffeinated), powdered taro root, blueberry powder (antioxidants), powdered coconut milk, and stevia extract, so everything is officially plant-based. It\u2019s sweet, nutty, and earthy thanks to the taro. If you\u2019re already a taro lover, you don\u2019t need convincing. You\u2019ve wanted this all along.Because it\u2019s mid-July, I like to make it as overnight oats, but you can also pour hot water over it, stir, wait a few minutes, and eat. Sometimes I cheat the \u201covernight\u201d part and stir it together an hour before eating\u2014though it has a slight powdery texture when you do that because the ingredients haven\u2019t had time to dissolve. Impatient me doesn\u2019t care!However, there\u2019s no boba in the oatmeal. Founder Lin Jiang realized it just couldn\u2019t work. \u201cI actually tried it in my kitchen with dried, quick-cooking tapioca pearls,\u201d she told me via email. \u201cIt didn\u2019t cook that quickly, and in the meantime, I had to add a lot to the recipe to make them noticeable, and that added a lot of carbs on paper.\u201d (Yishi is aiming to be lower in carbs, with more nutrient-dense ingredients than your usual brown sugar-cinnamon stuff.) But the flavor is so reminiscent of bubble tea, I\u2019m happy.Yishi also makes a Matcha Latte flavor that I love topped with strawberries, Sweet Osmanthus (great with blueberries or bananas), Toasted Black Sesame (I didn\u2019t get to try but sounds amazing), and Red Bean Berry (ditto). They\u2019re all inspired by Lin\u2019s mom\u2019s black sesame cereal:\u201cMy mom would grind black sesame, black soy, walnut, almond and mix them up with some sort of grain like rice or barley because oats were not common in China when I was little,\u201d said Lin, who grew up in Qingdao. \u201cShe would cook them into a warm bowl of black sesame cereal that\u2019s sweet, toasty, and nutty. It was my favorite food growing up and later on I realized that it was also so nutritious.\u201dBuy the pouch for a good $deal$, or pick up a pack of the individual cups if you\u2019re stashing them at your desk or in your camping box. They\u2019re also selling little sample pouches if you\u2019re on the fence.Photograph by Emma FishmanYishi Taro Bubble Tea Oatmeal$8 at Amazon$8 at Yishi FoodsExplore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingHighly RecommendRecipes you want to make.
