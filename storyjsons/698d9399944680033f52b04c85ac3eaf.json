She blisters Korean rice cakes, or tteok, until they\u2019re toasty and crisp with chewy insides, then pairs them with seared, melty Halloumi cheese. The combination of nutty brown butter and spicy-sweet gochujang will have you dragging your rice cakes across the plate to mop up every last bit of sauce. You can find prepackaged Korean rice cakes in the refrigerated section at any Korean market or well-stocked Asian grocer. You might find they come in all shapes and sizes, from long cylinders to thin ovals. Any shape will work in this recipe, but it\u2019s especially delicious prepared with rice cakes that come in 2\"\u20133\"-long cylinders, which excel at achieving a crispy exterior while staying chewy and soft on the inside. If you have any brown-butter-gochujang sauce left over, spoon it over fried eggs and yogurt the next morning\u2014one of Kim\u2019s favorite breakfasts.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Halloumi cheese, cut into \u00bd\"-thick planks (about the same size as rice cakes)PreparationStep 1Soak rice cakes in a medium bowl of cool water at least 1 hour and up to 12 hours. Drain and pat dry with a kitchen towel; set aside.Step 2Using a slotted spoon, carefully lower eggs one at a time into a small saucepan of boiling water.

Peel eggs, cut in half, and set aside.Step 3Cook butter in a small saucepan over medium heat, occasionally swirling pan, until butter foams then browns, 3\u20135 minutes. Remove from heat and immediately whisk in garlic, gochujang, gochugaru, vinegar, salt, and 2 Tbsp. water. Reduce heat to low and keep sauce warm.Step 4Arrange about 3 cups arugula on a platter or large plate.Step 5Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high.

Turn over and cook until golden brown on the other side, about 5 minutes. Transfer rice cakes to platter with arugula; reserve skillet.Step 6Reduce heat to medium and cook Halloumi cheese in reserved skillet until deep golden brown, about 30 seconds per side. (It\u2019s okay if some pieces break apart.)Step 7Arrange cheese on platter with arugula and rice cakes. Top with remaining arugula and reserved jammy eggs.

The contrast between the crispy rice cakes, squeaky halloumi, and fresh greens is a perfect harmony. My favorite part is the sauce. I\u2019m so obsessed with it that I now scale it up and put it on just about everything.  Anonymous3/6/2022This was incredible. Soaked the rice cakes for one hour and they were excellent once fried. Nothing left on anyone's dinner plates. Cannot wait to make this again.ashMaryland2/27/2022I'm assuming this recipe uses dried rice cakes, but it doesn't specify. The cylindrical ones also come frozen, in which case I'd assume they don't need soaking....That might be a good detail to add to this recipe for clarity. AnonymousMissoula MT2/4/2022One of my standard breakfasts is arugula topped with soft boiled eggs and gochujang, so this dish was certainly up my alley. I used half of the package of rice cakes and that gave me a good ratio of salty, crispy/chewy, green, etc. I'm excited to make this again. AnonymousPNW1/6/2022Very tasty! Not sure how many people this is intended to serve, we guessed 2 as there are 2 eggs -- however we found this to be a lot of food for just 2 people (specifically the amount of rice cakes). We tossed the rice cakes in the dressing prior to mixing it with the greens and it was excellent.\n\nWould definitely make again -- though, 1/2 the amount of rice cakes, and add some more vegetables :PAnonymousNew York, NY12/21/2021After soaking rice cakes for a few hours, the frying left them tough and inedible.  The halloumi which I\u2019ve made before did not come out meaty/chewy and the sauce didn\u2019t tie the dish together. Didn\u2019t work for me AnonymousSanta Monica CA12/20/2021Explore Bon App\u00e9titDinnerMainKoreanEast AsianAsianHalloumiCheeseKorean Rice CakeNoodlePasta & NoodlesArugulaLeafy GreensVegetableFryVegetarianNut-FreeGluten-FreeRecipes you want to make.
