Don\u2019t. Beyond the blocky, metal 6-8 above the doorway, there are no signs indicating anything more than offices inside the Dumbo building. There is. Once you enter the generic lobby, you\u2019ll almost run into a pole (probably propped there for structural integrity). Now you might be wondering: Have you been cast as victim number one in Saw 18? Nope, but it does feel as if someone is trying to divert you from something. Or push you somewhere else. And that might very well be the intention of Burrow, a sweet but strange Japanese bakery that\u2019s quietly creating otherworldly cakes and cookies that baffle pastry chefs and bring in customers like Louis Vuitton artistic director Virgil Abloh.\u201cHi, nice to see you again,\u201d Ayako Kurokawa says to me, as she pokes her head behind the unsalted-butter-yellow linen curtains by the cash register. She\u2019s wearing tan Birkenstocks, a denim jumper-like apron, and a white beret. Then she disappears. It\u2019s 11:08 a.m. this balmy Friday, and I\u2019ve arrived just as tiny plates of raspberry jam-filled linzer cookies, pudgy slices of pistachio cake, and cream puffs are replacing the breakfast menu of cornbread-like smoked salmon cakes, shellacked croissants, and jiggly tomato and Gruy\u00e8re quiches.The pastry case at Burrow.\nAlex LauBurrow is a glass-enclosed, oval-shaped bakery, where the front half is made up of small cases of constantly changing pastries, a few spindly stools, and a narrow counter by the windows that offers a clear view of the drab lobby and people stumbling into that pole. The back half holds the studio-turned-bakery Kurokawa has fashioned for herself and her team of three other Japanese female bakers. I follow her inside.To say I\u2019m obsessed with Burrow is an understatement. Sure, it\u2019s one thing to arrive 15 minutes late to the office to pick up some breakfast goods on your way in. It\u2019s another thing to return again and again, once you find out cakes aren\u2019t ready until the afternoon, to the point where you\u2019ve carved out a Burrow-visiting calendar for yourself that may or may not require the use of personal days. Despite my intense loyalty, it\u2019s taken almost as long to meet Kurokawa. But after a few more visits and consistent follow-up emails with lots of exclamation points, I finally convinced her to let me peek behind the curtains.The circus-tent-inspired strawberry cake.\nAlex LauThat said, today, I have a very important mission: to crack the code behind Burrow. It\u2019s not new (four years old at this point). It\u2019s barely noticeable (in addition to no signs, there\u2019s no phone). Its strict schedule, hand-stitched in red yarn on the curtains\u2014open Monday to Friday, 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., with breakfast ending at 11 a.m. and cakes out around 2 p.m.\u2014makes it difficult to find time to even visit. Kurokawa has no outstanding pedigree (stints at The Modern and the Plaza Hotel in New York City). And yet, Burrow has racked up 78,000 Instagram followers (and counting) and customers from all over the world queue up out the door.\u201cI remember stumbling across her Instagram account years ago and just being floored. There is this tiled hexagonal cake that I look up over and over again, trying to figure out how it\u2019s made,\u201d says Anna Posey, the pastry chef and co-owner of Elske in Chicago. \u201cWhen I finally made it into her shop a few years ago, the bakery is just what I hoped for. Everything is perfectly executed, minimal, creative, and beautiful. I would definitely call her an artist.\u201dAyako Kurokawa, the baker and brains behind Burrow, at her station.\nAlex LauIn the kitchen space, Kurokawa sets up her station, a nook in between the fridges and the sink. An unframed, Impressionistic oil painting of an orange-bonnet-wearing woman hangs on the wall, along with a tumble of cake molds strung together like a giant charm bracelet. Back when this space was simply a studio for Kurokawa to experiment and bake on a special-order basis, she painted this wall with curvy, red strokes to mimic antique wallpaper. It\u2019s still there today. While the three other bakers roll up almond croissants and lather up cake layers with offset-spatulas at fast-forward speed, time seems to have stopped in her corner. I\u2019ve stepped into Kurokawa\u2019s world, which Posey says is like \u201chaving an Alice in Wonderland moment.\u201d And for the next five hours, I forget I\u2019m in New York City.Unlike sterile restaurant kitchens, it feels more like a home kitchen, infused with\u2014and powered by\u2014 with her personality and style. There are miniature magnets made by Kurokawa everywhere: a tiny green trash can for recycling pick up on the kitchen white board, a Baldor logo for ingredient drop-off, little cakes on the SunFire ovens, indicating what\u2019s baking inside. Black Crane-designed aprons, loose and flowy like a very stylish parachute, hang on the side of the ovens, a collaboration Kurokawa forged with Momo Suzuki, the designer behind the cult jumpsuit brand.When asked how she finds inspiration, Kurokawa pauses for a long time. \u201cThat\u2019s a tough question,\u201d she says with a nervous laugh. She brushes it off and continues working at her station, silently cutting chunks of frozen carrots to then mix with orange juice for a vegan carrot cake. Anytime I ask Kurokawa about her process, she tends to shy away from answering, not because she\u2019s secretive, but more because she doesn\u2019t really have an answer, as if she hasn\u2019t given it much thought. When she gets her portrait taken for this story, she appears visibly uncomfortable, punctuating each click of the camera with a little \u201cah\u201d and shuffling away as fast she can once it\u2019s over. Most artists love talking about themselves, their creations, their genius. Have you heard of Kanye? But Kurokawa hates making herself the center of attention, instead letting her cakes take, well, the cake.Inside the kitchen at Burrow.\nAlex LauAs a kid in Hokkaido, she never had an affinity for baking. But then after moving to New York City in 2000 to go to college to study English, she stayed in the city by taking odd jobs: handing out Japanese newspapers in Midtown East (which is how she met her husband), cooking at a Japanese deli, making rice balls at a Japanese bakery. Kurokawa decided to give pastry a shot. She brought her resume to The Modern in 2006 and soon became enraptured by the citrus tuiles and pulled candy she was learning how to make. But after a couple years working in other restaurant pastry departments, coming home in tears from the stress of the job, Kurokawa ventured out on her own. Out of this rented studio, in 2012, she started selling cakes to friends and anyone who found her via Instagram or by word of mouth, like Cartier for a company event or Anna Wintour for a birthday party.Kurokawa can pinpoint when her Instagram took off; it was in 2013 when visual artist Mimi Jung snapped a quick pic of a fruit-filled sponge roll cake. Weirdly, the photo isn\u2019t particularly stylized or even beautiful, but after that Kurokawa\u2019s page took on a life of its own. She started removing personal photos\u2014if you haven\u2019t noticed, Kurokawa is very private\u2014and posting her creations instead. Still, it took a good friend\u2019s urging to make Kurokawa turn her one-person studio into a retail bakery in 2014.The gravity-defying strawberry tart.\nAlex LauBy 12:17 p.m., the three bakers are out for lunch, and Kurokawa is the only one in the kitchen. Her favorite time. \u201cI think I\u2019m more productive and creative when I\u2019m alone,\u201d she says. She rubs her hands together and looks at the production list for the day. Caramel mousse for coffee cake is next on her list. It\u2019s silent, and Kurokawa is lost in her thoughts. She\u2019s thinking about circus tents, which inspired the vertical stripes you find when you cut into her stunning strawberry cake. She\u2019s thinking about how to maintain the shape and colors of apples, which is how she dreamed up her Dali-like cake that\u2019s draped with thin, mandolined outlines of the fruit. She just does what she likes. But what she likes straddles fantasy and function, and it unlocks something in me, and others: a genuine delight in seeing her romanticism and playfulness, something not typically evoked in serious, liquid-nitrogen-enhanced restaurant desserts or, worse, over-the-top desserts strategically engineered for social virility. Kurokawa makes you feel like you\u2019re in on an inside joke with her googly eyed upside-down pineapple cakes and cartoonish face cookies.The flurry of the last few moments before Burrow closes for the day.\nAlex LauBy 1:32 p.m., everyone is back, and they\u2019re staring at me. I realize I\u2019m standing in front of the production list and move aside. The bakery hums back to life, and Kurokawa and her crew hurry through the long lists of tasks\u2014prepping focaccia dough, cutting out butter cookies, readying themselves for the usual 3 p.m. onslaught, cleaning up for the weekend ahead. Dreaming of new desserts will have to wait for later that night or the next day. By 4:22 p.m., she unfurls another set of linen curtains, sliding them to cover all the windows. The shop is now closed, but they\u2019ll be back at it on Monday.For the first few years, the way Kurokawa talked about Burrow was as her castle. It was place to decidedly do her own thing but also to protect herself, her process, and her employees in ways restaurants had failed her before. By treating her bakers with kindness. By having humane hours and weekends off. After years of honing her craft and getting to know her customers, on and offline, Burrow has taken on a different meaning for Kurokawa.\u201cI imagine a day at Burrow as theater,\u201d Kurokawa says. \u201cThe show begins at 9 a.m. and ends at 4 p.m., when we close the curtains.\u201dExplore Bon App\u00e9titRestaurants + TravelNew York CityPastryRead MorecookingThe Long-Anticipated New Cookbook from a Teeny Bakery in North CarolinaBy Sarah JampelrestaurantsNapa Has Changed, Butter Cream Bakery Has NotBy Kira GarciarestaurantsWhy People Travel Far and Wide for Shatila Bakery's BaklavaBy Priya KrishnaPhotography by Emily BergerRecipes you want to make.
