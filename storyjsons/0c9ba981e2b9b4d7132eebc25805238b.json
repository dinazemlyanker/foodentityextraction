Courtesy of the artist and Marian Goodman Gallery, New York. \u00a9 Julie Mehretu.FacebookTwitterEmailI wanted to end this year\u2019s Holiday Issue with gratitude for those who make it possible, and with art for our soul and mind. So I chose this amazing piece by Julie Mehretu, an incredible artist and a friend of mine. It was inspired by the California wildfires, and it reminds me of fireworks, boiling pots, emotions running high. I see so much of the year in this painting, including its bright spots: my block becoming a community center with parents pitching in to give our kids a sense of normalcy, line cooks and servers passing out food to protesters, the strength of the Black Lives Matter movement. And I see a brighter, better future. I know now more than ever: We must keep rising. Happy Holidays.\u00a0Explore Bon App\u00e9titHoliday 2020Recipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
