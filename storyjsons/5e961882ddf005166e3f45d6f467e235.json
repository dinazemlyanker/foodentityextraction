Building a grown-up kitchen was the most exciting thing I could imagine, and I dreamed big. Sure, I wanted a real bottle of soy sauce rather than a heap of mini takeout packets. But I also envisioned shelves teeming with baking supplies and a quantity of spices rivaled only by the aisles of an actual grocery store. My inventories\u2014which were written like a smitten 7th grader doodling her crush\u2019s name over and over\u2014were extensive and impractical. Where would I even store all those flours?! In reality, the only section of my list that made it to the shelf in full was the one titled VINEGARS.I love vinegar, and all the heavy hitters that featured in my 22-year-old vision still sit prominently on my shelf today: sherry and champagne vinegar for salad dressings; apple cider vinegar for braised greens and beans; rice and black vinegar for sauces and marinades; balsamic because you never know. I think of them like a little acidic family, sisters not twins, alike in brightness but each bringing something unique and special to the table. I love that they always have my back when whatever I\u2019m cooking needs a little *something*\u2014I can open the cabinet and reach for one of the crew. But even with that variety built into my pantry, I am liable to fall into a vinegar rut. I know there are no rules, but I turn to the same vinegars for the same applications over and over, reinforcing a pattern that yields the same (good, but expected) flavors every time. At least, that was the case before I tried Acid League.Skip to 15:20 for Kendra's Acid League vinegar Tom Collins recipe.\nAcid League launched in 2019 and quickly became a Hot Girl Vinegar, thanks to exciting flavors, pretty bottles, and savvy marketing. The company offers a diverse array of products that are, by their own definition, \u201cscience-driven experiments in acid, with a chef's focus on flavor\u201d\u2014vinegar being their central effort. I was wary of buying into the hype at first, as I\u2019d been burned by a few slick Instagram ads before and felt very protective of my limited pantry space. On a trip through Whole Foods, however, I came across the company\u2019s Garden Heat variety and brought the bottle home to add to my long-standing collection; now I\u2019m a disciple of the church of Fun Vinegars, a category of pantry staple I think is just as important as the basic bottles you know you have to own.Big League Vinegar Kit$49 at Acid LeagueFun vinegars bump your go-to dressings and sauces to 11, adding another element of flavor and a bit of complexity that you and your mouth are not expecting. They\u2019re not meant to supplant your regular vinegars entirely but instead shine when your dishes require a shake-up. I like Acid League because their flavors are exciting but not overpowering, versatile and full of character, the kind of thing that makes people ask, \u201cWhat\u2019s in this?\u201d They\u2019re punchy but not kitschy, if that makes sense\u2014unlike other \u201cflavored\u201d pantry items, they\u2019re liable to become real staples, rather than get used just once as a gag. Despite their creative names, these earn their keep as regular parts of the rotation.If you have identified some holes in your own vinegar collection, there\u2019s an Acid League flavor that\u2019s right for you. The company has an extensive line-up, with core flavors as well as seasonal and limited-edition drops (all are winners, IMO). As a lover of vinegar-based hot sauces, Garden Heat spoke to me immediately; it\u2019s not spicy but definitely warm, fresh, and vegetal thanks to carrot, celery, and jalape\u00f1o juices. I love it as a pickling liquid, in a fried chicken brine, or as part of a cocktail\u2014especially with gin. Because I\u2019m often craving a squeeze of lemon or lime over a finished dish, I gravitated to the citrus flavors as well, like Meyer Lemon Honey or Rare Citrus, which is deep orange and includes bergamot, yuzu, and grapefruit. And though I never would have guessed it, Roasted Vegetable Balsamic rose to the top of the pack for me as well. Unlike sticky-sweet grocery store versions of balsamic vinegar, this one has a savory, caramelized onion-like depth that I\u2019ve been shaking into stews and stir fries with abandon.Garden Heat Vinegar$15 at Acid LeagueIf you don\u2019t know where to start on your Fun Vinegar journey, Acid League sells a Big League set with four rotating flavors\u2014the ideal way to get a feel for what you like and break yourself out of a basic vinegar rut. You\u2019ll be surprised at how all of your tried-and-true marinades and sauces feel new with just one substitution, and you might find yourself daydreaming about all the ways your new vinegars could light up your pantry. If you start doodling flavor names in the margins of your notebook, don\u2019t say I didn\u2019t warn you.Explore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingHighly RecommendCultureRecipes you want to make.
