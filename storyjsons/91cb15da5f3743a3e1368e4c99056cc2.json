And, okay, the gigantic camper coffee thermos helped too.By Aliza AbarbanelOctober 15, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Sidney BensimonFacebookTwitterEmailThis is Highly Recommend, a column dedicated to our very opinionated editors\u2019 favorite things to eat, drink, and buy.I\u2019m a semi-reformed insomniac who struggles to get out of bed before 8 a.m. (okay, 9). It probably goes without saying that breakfast is not my preferred meal. But when you\u2019re spending the weekend at Tourists, a designy 48-room lodge in North Adams, Massachusetts, just half a mile away from the Appalachian Trail, something\u2019s gotta give.So when I valiantly signed up for the hotel\u2019s scheduled morning hike, I was surprised and delighted to find myself ordering exactly half of the carefully considered breakfast menu. There were chewy, nutty rye waffles topped with sweet ricotta and cherry compote. Highly aromatic sourdough cardamom buns lacquered with a deliciously sticky-sweet glaze. A fluffy seasonal vegetable frittata served with a tangle of greens. Also copious amounts of strong coffee poured from a steaming camper thermos. It was the perfect meal to get me over the dangling suspension bridge into the trees, and kept me going as I explored the rest of North Adams (MASS MoCA!) and all the casually New England vibes Brooklyners like me crave: dusty antique stores, well-stocked farm stands, and the hotel\u2019s probably haunted farmhouse-turned-bar built in 1813.If it sounds like a lot to get through in one day, well, it was. Usually, my vacation days revolve around doing as little as I possibly can. And when I first woke up in the sleekly minimalist room, all I wanted to do was bundle up in a cozy robe and lounge on the pillowy indigo daybed. But once those rye waffles lured me out of bed, the rest of my day was transformed into a tour de force of weekend activities.Would I be a morning person every day if I lived at Tourists? I\u2019m not convinced, but for the sake of science, I\u2019m already planning a return trip.Go there: TouristsExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendMassachusettsHotelsRead MorerestaurantsThe New England Deli Two Bon App\u00e9tit Editors Can\u2019t Stop Talking AboutBy Amanda Shapiro and Aliza AbarbanelRecipes you want to make.
