See our past recommendations here!Forget Disneyland or the beach\u2014my shower is my happy place. I start craving steam as soon as the temperature dips below 70\u00b0F, but the combination of hot water and the shifting seasons wrecks havoc on my poor dried-out skin. So ever since I ditched bottled body wash to reduce my plastic use, I\u2019ve been searching for a hydrating bar soap with silky smooth suds, and that bar is Mater Soap\u2019s ultra-hydrating geranium bar.The Brooklyn-based brand is helmed by Addison Walz, whose background in sculpture, textiles, and natural dyes helped her produce this aesthetically impeccable soap. Her cold-pressed process also avoids drying ingredients like sodium lauryl sulphate (SLS), opting for sustainably sourced ingredients like rosy kaolin clay and smoky pine tar. I\u2019m especially into geranium\u2019s cheerful peachy hue and delicious floral scent.It\u2019s made from a blend of olive oil and coconut oil that\u2019s similar to castile soap (of Dr. Bronner\u2019s fame), with plenty of shea butter for an extra moisturizing boost. Best of all, the smell of geranium, hibiscus, and annatto seed lingers on my skin throughout the day. When I\u2019m stuck on a stalled subway car or trapped in a two-hour meeting, one whiff reminds me of a better place: a hot shower. \u2014Aliza Abarbanel, Healthyish assistant editorBuy it: Mater Soap Geranium Bar, $14.All products featured on Healthyish are independently selected by our editors.
