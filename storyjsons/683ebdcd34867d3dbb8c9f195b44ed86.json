Pro tip: If you sign up for the newsletter, you'll get the scoop before everyone else.Dear Healthyish readers,For the last few weeks, I\u2019ve been dreaming of a simple bowl of fresh, short-grain white rice topped with a small pat of butter and a drizzle of soy sauce. It\u2019s my Ratatouille moment, the food that transports me back to the occasional school night when my mother would allow my sister and me to gussy up our side of rice. It was a special treat tied to no real occasion\u2014I think she could just sense when we needed a little pick-me-up but didn\u2019t have time to pull out all the stops when she had to get dinner ready in 30 minutes.For years after I moved out of my parents\u2019 house, I nearly forgot about that simple pleasure. But my quarantine cooking habits have revealed that what I want to eat when seeking a little extra comfort is just a little bit of butter on/with/in/over...everything, rice included. These days, I\u2019ve been stocking up on European-style butter, like Kerrygold\u2014just a dab makes anything taste decadent.This Butter-Roasted Halibut has been in my rotation.\nPhoto by Christina ChaeyWhen I say I\u2019m putting a bit of butter in/on everything, I don\u2019t just mean toast or scrambled eggs (though I eat a lot of both). I\u2019m making a lot of produce-heavy dishes these days, like glazed beets or turnips and glossy green stir-fries, finishing with a pat of the good stuff that leaves me feeling sated. I\u2019ve also made Andy Baraghani\u2019s Salt and Pepper Fish, which includes a side of vinegar-and-butter rice, about six times. Then there have been the times when \u201cjust a bit\u201d of butter won\u2019t do, which is when only a bowl of velvety mushroom pasta or a tall, hot biscuit will do the trick. Because sometimes butter isn\u2019t best in small doses\u2014sometimes, you need to go big.Yours in dairy,Christina ChaeyAssociate editorExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishButteressayWhat's Chaey Cooking?Read MoreLifestyleThese Are a Few of My Favorite FatsBy Christina ChaeyRecipes you want to make.
