You\u2019ll run into coworkers meandering the snake plant-lined hallway between Studio and George Washington Bar, Gramercy freelancers hanging out for happy hour (or attempting to work) in this same space, and hotel guests tucking in at the restaurants. It\u2019s aiming to be an all-purpose kind of place and nailing it.PRACTICAL STUFF: Rates start at $200, for both traditional (queen, king) and shared (aka bunk bed) rooms.\u2014Elyse InamineAdrian GautEric MedskerWE ALSO LOVEThe Wythe HotelA waterfront stunner worthy of Williamsburg\u2019s destination statusSOS ChefsWhere serious cooks stock up in the East VillageEleven Madison ParkFour-star dining redefined from hit makers Daniel Humm and Will GuidaraExplore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
