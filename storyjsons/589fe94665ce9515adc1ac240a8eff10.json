But this appliance is a lot of fun, and I'm fully a convert; read more about the detailed ins-and-outs of air frying here. I made extra crispy brussels sprouts in mine last week in 11 minutes flat. Still unsure? If you're hesitant to pay full price on a kitchen appliance you\u2019ve never tried before, these Cyber Monday sales (see our full list of Cyber Monday cookware and kitchen deals here) are the perfect excuse to go for it. C'mon, live a little! If you\u2019re just cooking for one or two, I\u2019d recommend a basket-style air fryer like the Cosori or CRUXGG because they take up less space than a toaster oven-style fryer while still getting the job done. But if you need one that can do multiple racks of food, dehydrate apple slices, toast bread, and serve as an extra oven for holiday pie marathoning, go with the Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer Pro, which a few food stylists I know swear by as secondary ovens. That thing can do it all. Now, onto the best air fryer Cyber Monday deals! \u2014Alex Beggs, senior staff writerBreville Smart Oven Air Fryer ProThis is an all-in-one air fryer\u2013toaster oven combo, so if you\u2019re looking to upgrade your existing toaster oven, this is an excellent choice. The Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer Pro can tackle a batch of crispy chicken tenders, cook a frozen pizza, and even roast a 14-pound turkey should your full-sized oven crap out on you. Its Super Convection setting reduces cooking time by 30%, and its 13 preset functions can do everything from bake to reheat to dehydrate. This is certainly an investment appliance rather than an impulse buy, but right now, it\u2019s $100 off.Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer Pro$750 $400 at Sur La TableCosori Air Fryer Max XLOur favorite basket-style unit is the Cosori Air Fryer Max, and it's what associate food editor Rachel Gurjar uses to develop all her air fryer recipes.
