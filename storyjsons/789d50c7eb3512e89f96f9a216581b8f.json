But these days it seems I can\u2019t swipe an inch on my feed without seeing herbaceous-hued dining rooms, kitchen cabinets, boudoirs, feature ceilings\u2014even toolboxes(?). While common sage (Salvia officinalis) has long been prized for its earthy flavor and medicinal properties, sage green is\u2014according to me\u2014the official vibe of 2021.\u201cSage green reminds you of spring farmer\u2019s markets, when all the leafy produce is finally back in season,\u201d says designer and interior stylist Anna Brettschneider. \u201cIt\u2019s a muted green with grey undertones, somewhere between cool mint and warm moss.\u201d Already a color Brettschneider says we naturally associate with the outdoors, sage is coming inside for dinner too\u2014in the form of funky pepper grinders, fancy pans, and pretty placemats. During the pandemic especially \u201cwe are wanting to feel more connected to nature,\u201d she explains. \u201cIt also makes sense aesthetically to reflect the ingredients you\u2019re cooking with throughout your kitchen.\u201dPhotograph by Isa ZapataSowden Salt and Pepper GrinderKeep calm and crank on. This minimalist mill is made from stainless steel and features an adjustable grind coarseness.$49 at HAYColors play a huge role in the way we interpret the world around us. When we were all barefoot and roaming a monolithic piece of earth, different colors helped us identify two very important things: food and mates ('twas a simpler time). Via their saturation, brightness, and hue, colors affect us psychologically, explains Sally Augustin, PhD, an environmental psychologist and principal at Illinois-based Design With Science, a consultancy applying research-backed insights to spatial and object design. \u201cWe form cultural associations to families of shades that share a common name\u2014for example, we link blues to credibility and trustworthiness,\u201d she says. Sage green, on the other hand, is \u201cvery relaxing for us to look at.\u201d It\u2019s the chromatic answer to These Times.\u201cColor carries a lot of meaning for us,\u201d explains Our Place cofounder Shiza Shahid. \u201cWe use it to honor the rituals that have nourished us through the ages.\u201d The sage-colored release of their Instagram-famous Always Pan celebrates the namesake herb for its proliferation in cuisines and culinary traditions around the world. \u201cSage green also symbolizes sustainability and the health of the earth we share\u2014something that's very important to us,\u201d Shahid says. For Food52\u2019s tableware buyer, Casey Simring, it\u2019s her literal job to pore over colors and textures all day, making sure a product fits the team\u2019s \u201cless is more\u201d motto. And sage green, she says, is a sought-after shade that plays well with neutral colors. \u201cIt's hard not to think of freshness when you see such a soft, inviting green,\u201d Simring explains. \u201cAfter the past year and a half, I think everyone is looking for that fresh feeling right now.\u201dPhotograph by Isa ZapataAlways PanThe Russian doll of cooking equipment, this pan, steamer basket, and beechwood spatula nest together under one pretty sage dome.$145 at Our PlaceA quick way to bring sage green into your kitchen is with a lick of paint (in a shade like the evocatively named \u201cEndless Day\u201d or \u201cCountry Spring\u201d). \u201cThat could mean taking off all of your cabinet doors and splashing them with some paint, or it could simply mean covering a couple of walls in your space with a fresh coat,\u201d Brettschneider advises. If painting scares you (or your landlord), think small and bring in pops of color via your kitchenware. Placemats, for example, \u201care a great way to introduce color and style to your table, without committing a full dinnerware set or a dining room accent wall,\u201d agrees Simring. Just remember, Brettschneider heeds, to tie everything together with accent colors like soft terracotta, acid yellow, and bright orange. Just like the herb, sage green is happy to star the show\u2014or fade coolly and calmly into the background.If you really want to lean in, as they say, my colleague and resident BA plant expert Joseph Hernandez grudgingly admits sage is one of the easier herbs to grow at home. \u201cSo..... i really hate growing herbs indoors, because they're not \u2018easy\u2019 like everyone says; they have short lifespans and death wishes (looking at you, basil),\u201d he explains over Slack. \u201cBut sage is pretty prolific and hearty.\u201d Not to mention, delicious! A full-grown sage plant will reward you with ample aromatic leaves for butter-slicked tortellini, golden parathas, and all the tostadas.Eat Sage:Tortellini with Brown Butter and SageStore-bought tortellini are the kind of weeknight hack we can get behind\u2014especially when they're tossed with plenty of garlicky brown butter and toasty walnuts.View RecipeShop Sage:Photograph by Isa ZapataUashmama Essential Placemats 4-PackThese perfetto placemats are made in Italy using wax-coated paper, meaning they\u2019re spill and stain resistant and require nothing but a quick wipe-down after each use.$48 at Food52Photograph by Isa ZapataDutch OvenA good D.O. is something you\u2019ll use for life; cooking up bread, pasta, stews, and braises.
