Very flavorful! I used veggie broth and coconut aminos instead of soy sauce. My Thai curry paste is spicy and I knew that going in so I mixed the spicy one and a less spicy one and it\u2019s prefect. We do like spicy food though. \nI also added more veggies. Lastly I put the noodles in the bowl some fish on top and the soup over that. The soup cooks the fish to perfection. Also I never add salt like a recipe calls for. It\u2019s always (yes I said always) too salty. Thai curry paste and coconut aminos are salty and knowing this I didn\u2019t even salt a little while cooking. In the end I didn\u2019t feel this recipe needed any extra salt. It\u2019s a wonderful!! Will make again!! Kerri Richmond, Va 3/9/2022Delicious but I forgot the leeks so I used an onion & shallot. I\u2019m sure I will make again. Gloria Los Angeles 3/7/2022Fortunately, I read the reviews before making this. I didn\u2019t add any salt at the time the instructions called for it. I figured I would wait until the end to decide how much to add. I ended up not adding any salt to it at all. That being said, while the flavor was good, it still needed a little boost. I added 1t Penzey\u2019s Bangkok spice blend, and four dried Burma Spice Kaffir Lime leaves during the simmer. I also added more veggies with the kale: carrots, spinach, mushrooms. \n\nI will make it again, possibly adding coconut milk (as another reader suggested), and a chili pepper, though it is fine without those additions.Kimberly PPhx, AZ2/7/2022Although packed with many ingredients, the broth surprisingly lacked flavor. We won't be making again.MUSan Francisco, CA2/1/2022This was so bad! Made the recipe exactly as it was written and it was inedibly salty. To salvage it so we had something to eat for dinner I added coconut milk, chicken broth, chili oil and water. Edible after adding those but still not great. Would not make again. Maybe if you used 1/3 the salt the recipe calls foeIngridLos Angeles, CA1/29/2022Delicious but wish I had read the reviews first because mine was also too salty. Will make again as the recipe states, but leave seasoning until the very end. Very tasty though! Spatulacity Los Angeles1/26/2022This soup is yummy with these alterations: homemade chicken broth, 1/2 shredded chicken, less salt and honey, spinach instead of kale, with all leeks saut\u00e9ed at the start.Anonymous1/25/2022Before cooking I wish I had read the reviews! The soup is delicious, but yes, too salty as written. Otherwise delicious! I used homemade chicken stock so it was extra rich, and added a bit extra acid and curry paste. SpatulacityLos Angeles1/22/2022Delicious! As with other reviewers who liked this dish, I used about 2 tsp (not 2 Tbsp) of salt, then salted a bit more to taste at the end; I used about half the honey that was called for. Although the soup was delicious as is, I doctored it a bit at the end with a few extra dashes of soya sauce and vinegar, and a splash of fish sauce that really seemed to light it up. Really easy, fast, yummy meal that can accommodate whatever veggies need using up. It would be good with a protein too if you wanted to go that way (shredded chicken, shrimp, tofu...) but is fully satisfying without. This one will go into regular winter rotation!LisaTruckee, CA1/5/2022Really good and easy, I didn\u2019t add much salt because the red curry paste I use already has salt. I found topping with finely chopped kaffir lime leaves (store them in the freezer when you find them)  was extra yummy and bright. L.HarrisonLongmont, CO1/4/2022The review starting out of this world was spot on. I even made it next with onions and green Thai curry. Yum!Retired BobSanta Barbara1/1/2022This was out of this world. The flavors were amazing. Based on other reviews, I reduced the salt to two teaspoons and just did one tablespoon of honey. It was a perfect soup for a winter night.JessT77Wisconsin12/30/2021So delicious after a few Christmas days with red meat!  The red Thai curry is not too spicy!  Just right!!  We rate our food recipe adventures 1 - 10.  Hubby gives it a 12!AnonymousWhitehall, Michigan 12/28/2021Great recipe. Didn\u2019t use that much salt, but did stick to the correct amount of honey and it was too sweet. Might be my honey, but I\u2019m going to use 1 tablespoon next time. GretaSacramento CA12/23/2021Interesting flavors in the broth with the tahini / curry combo that didn\u2019t end up being a favorite, but glad I gave it a try! Overall pretty tasty and comforting, great textures with the noodles and kale. I took other reviewers\u2019 advice and reduced the salt by about half to start and added a touch more at the end.Karina BenloucifBrooklyn, NY12/23/2021Explore Bon App\u00e9titVegetarianEgg NoodleNoodlePasta & NoodlesCurrySoupDinnerWeeknightEasyVeganRecipes you want to make.
