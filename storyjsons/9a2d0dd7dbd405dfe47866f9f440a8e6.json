For Longoven\u2019s Andrew Manning, Megan Fitzroy Phelan, and Patrick Phelan, the defining menu item is the thing they\u2019ve never been able to stop fiddling with: a savory egg custard that they\u2019ve topped with everything from uni to summer flowers. As the team journeyed from DIY pop-up stalwarts to the owners of a new brick-and-mortar location, a version of this dish has always anchored their constantly changing restaurant.Photo by Fred + ElliottNovember 2016: Jasmine Rice CustardTwo years into the Longoven bi-weekly pop-up, Manning wants to put a savory custard on the menu (he\u2019s a chawanmushi fanatic). This month he finally does, mixing jasmine-rice-steeped milk with egg yolks, steaming it, then topping with crunchy cauliflower mushrooms, yuzu jelly, and Maine uni (Phelan\u2019s a fanatic). After the chefs wrap their day jobs (butchering, catering, and teaching pastry), the three refine the dish through late-night phone calls. In the end, the uni custard scores with diners. That\u2019s validation for the team, who are balancing their ambitious roving restaurant with regular work.Photo by Fred + ElliottAugust 2017: Corn CustardIt\u2019s summer, and Manning sees blue crabs and corn everywhere, so he makes a corn custard covered with fat hunks of Chesapeake blue crab, a double dose of shiitake (jelly and mushrooms), seaweed-cured egg, and shiso. More late-night calls ensue as they finalize this month\u2019s pop-up menu. It\u2019s been a hectic ride: They\u2019re six months into the renovation of Longoven\u2019s future home.Photo by Fred + ElliottJune 2018: Asparagus CustardMore blue crab! Manning plays off the classic pairing of crab and asparagus with this summer-flower-crowned custard. This iteration earns a spot on Longoven\u2019s debut menu in the new space, a familiar note among the chaos of opening. \u201cSurreal\u201d is the way the chefs describe the first night. Sometimes they forget they\u2019re not a pop-up and don\u2019t have to crank out 38 dishes at once. It\u2019s not until they get back to their homes, late after service, that they realize they\u2019re finally doing what they\u2019ve been dreaming of the past four years.Explore Bon App\u00e9titRestaurantsVirginiaDish DecodedRead MorerestaurantsDon\u2019t Call Passerotto FusionBy Elyse InaminerestaurantsAfter Three Moves, A Cult Neapolitan Pizzeria Calls NYC HomeBy Anthony MangiericultureAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez Learned Her Most Important Lessons from RestaurantsBy Hilary CadiganRecipes you want to make.
