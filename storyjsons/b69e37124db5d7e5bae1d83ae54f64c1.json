Plenty of people are squeamish about the idea of eating raw eggs in general, and on top of that making mayonnaise or aioli from scratch\u2014which is essentially what you\u2019re doing in this case\u2014can be tricky for the uninitiated. At best, it\u2019s an arm workout to get the oil, acid, and egg to completely emulsify; at worst, you end up with a broken emulsion that\u2019s streaky, mucilaginous (sorry), and inedible.But here\u2019s a secret: If you\u2019re not striving for authenticity when it comes to your Caesar, you\u2019re not missing out on much at all by swapping in a dollop of a store-bought mayonnaise for that raw egg yolk. You likely won\u2019t even be able to tell the difference, and this fridge-staple shortcut makes for a dressing that\u2019s quick and stress-free.Take, for instance, this peak-summer Tomato Caesar recipe. We\u2019ve taken the easy way out and called for a tablespoon of mayonnaise to take the egg yolk\u2019s place in the dressing. It lends just the right amount of richness and incorporates into a dressing more readily than the yolk\u2014remember that jarred mayo is just a stabilized emulsion of eggs and oil\u2014and you don\u2019t miss it at all when juicy, vibrant heirloom tomatoes, fresh basil, and shards of nutty Parmesan cheese are in play.Make this dressing your back-pocket Caesar hack for when bottled dressing is out of the question but dealing with raw eggs feels too fussy. What\u2019s more, you can blitz all of the ingredients together in a blender when whisking by hand feels like too much.Listen, if you\u2019re really a die-hard fan of the very mild \u201cyolky-ness\u201d that raw eggs bring to the party, you are, of course, welcome to go the authentic route. But let\u2019s be real, the other flavors in Caesar dressing\u2014like deeply savory Parmesan and anchovies, bright lemon juice, garlic\u2014are the true stars of your Caesar experience.A simple, speedy salad made with beautiful, peak-season tomatoes should be the epitome of effortless summer cooking\u2014stressing over dressing shouldn\u2019t be part of the process.Get the Recipe:Tomato CaesarAn extra-thick Caesar dressing gives this tomato salad its oomph\u2014and keeps it from sogging out at the picnic.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titFarmers Market ChallengecookingHealthyishRecipes you want to make.
