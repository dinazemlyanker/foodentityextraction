Pro tip: If you sign up for the newsletter, you'll get the scoop before everyone else.Healthyish friends,Well, we made it to 2020\u2014a nice, symmetrical year that I as a Virgo find quite pleasing. We got to wear double-zero sunglasses for the first time since 2010. We can stop saying \u201cthe teens\u201d because it\u2019s now the twenties, though not the Roaring ones...though I would not be mad if drop-waist dresses had a comeback sometime soon.Before you roll over and go back to sleep, let\u2019s talk food. Maybe you\u2019d like to eat a little healthier this year, or cook more, or spend less money on eating out. Maybe you already feel great about your food habits and just want some weeknight dinner inspiration for the new year. Maybe you like a good ten-day challenge. Maybe you\u2019re too hungover to think about food right now.Wherever you\u2019re at, the 2020 Feel Good Food Plan will meet you there. For the third year running, we\u2019re kicking off January with ten days of delicious, healthy dinners, and I have to say we really nailed it this time, from tomorrow\u2019s (vegan!) taco night to this squash salad with crispy chickpeas. Every recipe takes under an hour and uses no added sugar or artificial ingredients. They maximize your veggie intake without you really noticing (like this whole-wheat pasta that involves an ungodly amount of kale). They\u2019re adaptable for vegetarians, vegans, and gluten-free folks. And they\u2019re probably going to make enough for you to have leftovers for lunch the next day.Healthyish superstars Chris Morocco and Andy Baraghani developed these recipes, and I love all their children, but I\u2019m especially proud of Chris\u2019s chicken and rice meatballs, and Andy\u2019s turmeric salmon over a pile of wilted chard. And of course it wouldn\u2019t be the Feel Good Food Plan without dessert, which is where Healthyish columnist and Basically editor Sarah Jampel came through with these impossibly easy and snackable chocolatey date caramels (they\u2019re also vegan as long as your bittersweet chocolate is).If you\u2019re starting the ten-day plan with us tomorrow, hell yes! Here are your grocery lists for week 1 and week 2. We\u2019ll be highlighting the recipes every day on our Instagram Story, and I hope you\u2019ll tag #feelgoodfoodplan so I can see what you\u2019re making too. I also highly recommend doing the FGFP with a friend, so sign them up for the newsletter and you\u2019ll both get every day\u2019s recipe first thing each morning. And, lastly, email healthyish@condenast.com with any questions or feedback. We\u2019re here to help.So go back to lounging, and I\u2019ll see you in the kitchen tomorrow.Until then,Amanda ShapiroHealthyish EditorExplore Bon App\u00e9titFeel Good Food PlanHealthyishessayRead MorehealthyishThe Healthyish Feel Good Food PlanRecipes you want to make.
