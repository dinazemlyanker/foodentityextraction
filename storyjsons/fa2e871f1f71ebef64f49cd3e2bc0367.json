However, the fizzy friend you know and love is about to have a major overhaul that might remind you of a certain beloved seltzer. Today, Coca-Cola announced a new era for Diet Coke that includes fresh flavors and a sleek redesign for the first time in 35 years. Over a two-year innovation process, the company spoke to more than 10,000 people from across the country to gather insight on potential new flavors, aiming squarely at targeting millennials. And boy, did they deliver: the four official, very descriptive new flavors are Ginger Lime, Feisty Cherry, Zesty Blood Orange, and Twisted Mango. \"Through extensive consumer research, we learned that younger Americans have an affinity for bold, yet refreshing and great-tasting, flavors in their favorite foods and beverages\u2014from hoppy craft beers to spicy sauces,\" the brand wrote in a press release.The fruit and citrus flavors and original Diet Coke will be packaged in thin 12 ounce cans\u2014the same design as Dasani Sparkling\u2014and sold as on-the-go singles and in eight-packs to hit shelves this month. The new look includes the brand\u2019s classic silver with a simplified color palette, focused on silver and red with accents of other bright colors to represent the flavors. A slightly different typography \"simultaneously preserves Diet Coke\u2019s heritage, yet presents it in a more progressive manner.\" Don't you love marketing-speak?!If you're not big into change and can't handle more than one new feature at a time (or just really love those little mini-cans), don't worry, Diet Coke will continue to be offered in all existing package sizes and designs. But who doesn't want to at least try Feisty Cherry?Twitter contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Related: Espresso Cola: Give Your Soda the Coffee Treatment It DeservesExplore Bon App\u00e9titCold SodaSodaTrends + NewsTrendsRead MorecultureNow You Can Turn Water Into Sparkling Wine With Your SodaStream MachineBy Andrea ParkcultureWhich of These Grapefruit Sodas Won Our Blind Taste Test?By Christina Chaey and Amiel StanekcultureLaCroix's Newest Flavor Is Here\u2014If You Can Find ItBy Andrea ParkRecipes you want to make.
