Here we slip fillets into a tomato bath infused with Indian spices such as cumin and garam masala. The result: sublimely flaky fish that\u2019s anything but bland. Mild-flavored whitefish like cod, haddock, and halibut are the perfect complement to the fragrant spices in the tomato pur\u00e9e. But you can swap in any other protein that feels like it could use some help in the flavor department, such as chicken breasts or tofu.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

I thought I had garam masala and didn't so I substituted curry powder (and a little more cinnamon to help) and it still turned out incredibly tasty! Amazing over toasted garlic bread and I'm sure would also be awesome over rice or even potatoes. Delish!amyamyHouston, TX2/15/2022Outstanding \u2015 delicious, fantastically fast, and I made it with roasted potatoes instead of fried bread.  KSWPBaltimore, MD1/24/2022This recipe is yummy yummy!  One night we had it with the crusty bread - try adding some slices of garlic to the oil prior to frying the bread; next night served with saut\u00e9ed mashed potatoes (leftover).  Definitely our new favorite!  Thanks BA!AnonymousChicago1/24/2022My favorite way to make this is to sub the white fish for salmon w/skin on and cook the same way. Up the quantities of spices, and this is one of my best comfort dishes.Sarah SamynathanSan Francisco, CA1/3/2022I thought that this recipe was easy and delicious, I used a premade pasta sauce and tweaked all of the spices to suit my tastes and really liked it.:) I've mads it with many different types of white fish as well as chicken and all were goods. I make the sauce first, add some water to dilute a little more and then cook the protein in the sauce.Wendy BurtonBoquete, Panama12/2/2021This recipe is fabulous.  Instead of the bread, I served it over Spanish yellow rice.  I also used tomatoes from my garden and let the sauce simmer, with the spices, for 2-3 hours.AnonymousSpokane, WA11/8/2021Average.  I made it as written, and it really did need more flavoring - either increase the amounts of spices or I liked the idea of using harissa, as another reviewer noted.  Also, the puree was pretty thick; it still cooked the fish but as I was eating it and putting it on the toast, it unappetizingly thick, so I'd recommend either thinning it more or using crushed tomatoes as another poster did.  AnonymousGig Harbor, WA10/27/2021Amazing! Produces a lot of sauce though. You could probably get away with removing half of it before introducing your fish and freezing that to make another time. That would make this recipe shockingly... somehow... easier than it already is. Five stars.CatherineHoboken, NJ10/3/2021very average. needs some spice or greensJyotichicago9/3/2021Really delicious and flavorful recipe which I will definitely add to my favorite dinners list! This was also very easy to make and play with. I used Tutto Rossi crushed tomatoes with basil in place of tomato pur\u00e9e and added 2 tsp of harissa paste for some extra heat, which added a nice pop here. Served over basmati to lean into the Indian flair in the recipe and was so delicious!!AnonymousPhiladelphia, PA9/1/2021Delicious Miss SilToronto, Canada8/30/2021I added mussels to the mix and it was good but overall took away from the fish. Separately it would have been a good idea but not with the fish.
