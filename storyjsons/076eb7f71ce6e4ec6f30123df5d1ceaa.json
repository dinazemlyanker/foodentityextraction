He shares recipes he's been cooking, restaurants he's been eating at, and more. It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.Claire Saffitz makes all your favorite baked goods.Whenever I wander down to the Bon App\u00e9tit test kitchen, I\u2019m usually looking for a nibble or a nosh. That, and to see what Claire Saffitz is up to.I think it\u2019s fair to say that Claire is our most...erudite test kitchen editor (She went to a certain college in Cambridge, Massachusetts\u2014ahem.) And she cooks and bakes in ways that I can\u2019t even begin to aspire to.Take her hit series, \"Gourmet Makes,\" on Bon App\u00e9tit\u2019s YouTube channel. From one episode to the next, millions of viewers tune it to watch Claire attempt to make Cheetos from scratch (and nearly turn orange with frustration along the way); toil for days concocting homemade Gushers (turns out a syringe is necessary); pulling sugar with the determination of The Rock while pursuing the secret to Skittles...and, well, you get the idea. To say it\u2019s addictive viewing would be an understatement.But for those of us on staff, as well as for everyone who turns to BA for its recipes, Claire is our dessert maven.Want this letter before it hits the website? Sign up for our newsletter!Every day around 3 p.m., aka Coffee O\u2019Clock, there is a good chance Claire will be setting out something absolutely irresistible in our test kitchen. One week it could be her moist and flavorful swirled tahini tea cake (if ever there was a loaf meant for a cup of freshly brewed coffee), the next her glistening, crispy-yet-fluffy focaccia. I feel like we should all submit our gym membership bills to Claire; she\u2019s clearly the reason we\u2019re carrying around a few extra pounds these days.Unlike most of us home cooks, Claire takes an exacting, nearly obsessive approach to her craft. She will test a recipe again and again and then one more time, just for good measure. She speaks in terms I literally don\u2019t understand. On a recent episode of the Bon App\u00e9tit Foodcast, I was interviewing her about her easy sheet cake with chocolate-cream cheese frosting (which is basically the best from-scratch birthday cake your mom never made you). Thinking that \u201ceasy\u201d was the operative word in the recipe, the next thing I knew, she\u2019s talking about \u201cmechanical leavening,\u201d how certain ingredients are \u201chygroscopic,\u201d and how gluten comprises \u201cglutenin and gliadin.\u201d Did not see any of that coming.Photo by Chelsie CraigNot that you need to be a whiz to enjoy Claire\u2019s creations. She does the hard work so the rest of us don\u2019t have to. Our associate social media manager Emily Schultz aptly described Claire\u2019s rhubarb custard cake as being \u201csomewhere between pudding and heaven.\u201d And, I mean, really\u2014where else would anyone want to be?Get Claire\u2019s recipes:Swirled Sesame Tea CakeFocacciaEasy Sheet Cake with Chocolate-Cream Cheese FrostingRhubarb Custard CakeExplore Bon App\u00e9titAdam NewsletterRead MorecultureMeet Senior Associate Food Editor Claire SaffitzBy Bon App\u00e9titcookingThe 10 Baking Questions People Ask Me Literally All the Time, AnsweredBy Claire Saffitzeffed it up3 Reasons Why Your Baking Fail Is Probably Not Your FaultBy Claire SaffitzRecipes you want to make.
