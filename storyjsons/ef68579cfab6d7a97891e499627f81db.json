The less perfect they are, the cooler they look. No trimming, no tucking, no crimping, no venting, and no soggy bottom. They\u2019re also versatile: You can make a version of this year-round with the same amount of peak-season fruit.Ingredients6\u20138 servings Dough1cup all-purpose flour\u2153cup buckwheat flour3Tbsp. sugar1tsp. kosher salt\u00bdcup (1 stick) unsalted butter, cut into piecesFilling and AssemblyAll-purpose flour (for surface)1lb. rhubarb, cut into \u00be\" pieces8oz. strawberries, hulled, halved if large1Tbsp. plus 1\u00bd tsp. cornstarch\u2153cup sugar, plus more for sprinkling\u00bdvanilla bean, halved lengthwise, or \u00bd tsp. vanilla extract1large egg, beaten to blendWhipped cream, ice cream, or cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche (for serving)PreparationDoughStep 1Whisk all-purpose and buckwheat flours, sugar, and salt in a large bowl to combine. Add butter and work into dry ingredients with your hands, mashing it into big flat pieces and smooshing it between your palms into the flour, until you have pea- and nickel-size pieces.Step 2Drizzle \u00bc cup ice water over mixture and rake it in with your fingers until evenly dispersed. Squeeze clumps with your hands to moisten until a shaggy dough forms, then turn out onto a work surface.Step 3Gather dough together, pushing and working it into a ball, then flattening it, until only a few dry spots remain. Pat into a \u00be\"-thick square. Using a bench scraper or knife, divide dough into 4 pieces. Stack pieces on top of one another, placing any unincorporated dry bits in between layers, and press down to combine. Form dough into a \u00be\"-thick disk and wrap tightly in plastic. Chill until firm, at least 2 hours and up to 3 days.Filling and AssemblyStep 4Preheat oven to 400\u00b0. Roll out dough on a well-floured surface to a 14\" round, rotating dough and tossing more flour underneath as needed to keep it from sticking. Transfer dough to a large parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet (most galettes will spring a leak at the creases of the pastry, even for pros). Place rhubarb, strawberries, cornstarch, and \u2153 cup sugar in a medium bowl. Scrape in vanilla seeds and discard pod; toss ingredients to evenly distribute.Step 5Mound filling in center of dough, making sure to scoop up all the sugar and cornstarch in bowl, and spread out, leaving a 2\" border around edges. Fold dough up and over filling, overlapping slightly. Brush dough with egg and sprinkle dough and filling generously with sugar.Step 6Bake galette until filling is bubbling and crust is deeply browned, 40\u201350 minutes. Let cool slightly. Serve topped with whipped cream.Read More: The 29 New Essential Recipes from the Bon App\u00e9tit Test KitchenHow would you rate Fruit Galette with Buckwheat Crust?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (2)Back to TopTriangleThe buckwheat really accented the tart and sweet fruit, delicious!
