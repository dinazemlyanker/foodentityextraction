Her coffee, for one, might be hidden behind a stack of cookies. You\u2019ll never see all of the downtime on set while dough chills and ovens preheat. There\u2019s singing, dancing, and deep philosophical conversations about the Fast and the Furious franchise. You don\u2019t see the culinary assistants in the corner, crouched in front of a stainless steel cabinet, searching for the right type of coconut oil. And even I wasn\u2019t allowed to see the Google sheet of the budget, which producer Tyre Nobles assures me almost always comes in \u201cunder.\u201d (When Tyre brought his own iron in from home\u2014more on why later\u2014I believed him.)This January, I was allowed to lurk on set to document behind the scenes of Gourmet Makes: Girl Scout Cookies and now I can share that riveting glimpse with you, dear superfans. The crew wanted this to be a story about the power of friendship. And maybe it is. But it\u2019s also about our loosey-goosey formula for making good, wholesome, fun TV here at Bon App\u00e9tit. (So far, Gourmet Makes has chalked up over 200 million views.) Here\u2019s a day-by-day, hour-by-hour track record of how it gets done. With lunch breaks.But First\u2026 A Few Things Claire Would Like to Clear Up Real Quick:\u201cWe\u2019re not sponsored by companies that make snack foods.\u201d\u201cWe eat the leftovers. They go to editors and video team. There\u2019s a Slack channel about it.\u201d\u201cThere was a rumor I moved to Alaska and started a bakery. I didn\u2019t.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not here against my will.\u201dWatch the episode of Claire making Girl Scout Cookies\nDay 11:00 p.m.-ishAfter tracking down Claire, who\u2019s just finished filming the bagel bites episode, director Dan Siegel tells me he\u2019s worried she\u2019s going to want to eat lunch before filming begins. She stands in front of the pyramid of Girl Scout cookies and says, \u201cwhy not break for lunch?\u201d Nope. She blows air out of her lips. The crew assembles into their usual spots, from  from left to right from Claire\u2019s POV:Jon Weigell, associate producer, is sitting on a crate with his laptop. Jon keeps notes for the editors but sometimes misspells things, like \u201csilk pad\u201d instead of \u201csilpat,\u201d which cracks everyone up. He\u2019s also a singer in two metal bands: Sabretooth and Attempted Revenge.Kevin Dynia, director of cinematography, is wearing an \u201ceasyrig\u201d vest that protects his back while he holds the heavy camera on his shoulder. He, Tyre, and Jon are huge wrestling fans.Dan Siegel, director and No. 1 Claire wrangler, is standing at the ready with his beloved director\u2019s slate.Tyre Nobles, producer, morale boosting extraordinaire, and corporate credit card holder, is organizing the stash of Girl Scout cookies.Mike Guggino, sound mixer, is sitting on a stool with headphones on and a big bag of sound equipment. Mike plays guitar in a Led Zeppelin cover band but is also in a \u201creal band\u201d called The Space Merchants, FYI.Culinary assistant Christine Malanga (and me) seated against the Gourmet Makes pantry shelves by the windows.Rhoda Boone, food director for video and Claire\u2019s \u201cbiggest cheerleader in her darkest moments,\u201d is zooming around the kitchen. Rhoda oversees the culinary assistants who shop for groceries, source supplies, do prep work, and wash dishes for the various Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious shows.Dan moves a package of dried kelp out of the camera\u2019s sightline on Andy Baraghani\u2019s station, and then slaps his slate and we\u2019re rolling. Claire starts analyzing the pile of cookie boxes. \u201cSomeone already opened this one!\u201d she says holding a box of Tagalongs. Kevin groans, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201dWandering by with a huge English cucumber in hand, Adam Rapoport grabs a Samoa and says the new lemon cookies are \u201cnonsense.\u201d Someone on the crew says, \u201cwe\u2019ll have to blur that cucumber out,\u201d and they all laugh in a collective low, manly chuckle. This is when I realize everyone is either wearing flannel or Patagonia, and I see two pairs of hiking boots. The video team is very aesthetically outdoorsy.More Test Kitchen editors stop by to try cookies: Molly Baz, who drops her wallet and sends cards flying everywhere, Sohla El-Waylly, and Andy Baraghani, who\u2019s snackish for a Samoa.Lunch break! Dan has to tell Claire, \u201ceatcha burrito,\u201d because she\u2019s gotten distracted talking to me about how distracted she gets talking to her friends in the kitchen.3:42 p.mTyre has made everyone \u201cspa waters\u201d\u2014lemony, minty ice water\u2014in labeled quart containers. \u201cHe slaps the mint and everything!\u201d Jon tells me, eyes wide. Tyre waves his pointer finger in a slow circle to signal it\u2019s time to roll and Claire cracks up. \u201cTyre\u2019s hand motion\u2014only he can do it\u2014is a huge part of the show,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a morale booster.\u201dClaire scrapes the chocolate coating off a Tagalong, and shows us the button-like depression for the peanut butter. \u201cI fill my depression with peanut butter too,\u201d mumbles Kevin. The chuckle erupts.It\u2019s important to get that shot of the cookie\u2019s cross-section. For science.\nPhoto by Emma FishmanDan reminds Claire that now\u2019s time for her \u201cfavorite part.\u201d Reading the ingredients. Christine swoops in to take away the cutting board of cookie shavings. Claire says the famous line, but channels Eeyore. \u201cCan you...sound more excited about it?\u201d requests Dan. Claire\u2019s voice barely uplifts: \u201cAnd now it\u2019s time for my favorite part, reading the ingredients.\u201d Tyre dances.4:28 p.m.While Kevin sets up to shoot at the computer, where Claire will search YouTube for videos of Girl Scout cookie recipes, Claire and Mike chit-chat about J. Lo\u2019s Oscar nomination snub. The sun\u2019s going down, Claire lets out a monster yawn and stretches her arms, Mike touches his toes...energy is low. This is Take 9. I ask Dan how many takes there are in a typical shoot day. \u201cMany more than this,\u201d he replies.5:27 p.m.Claire believes that all Girl Scout cookies are the same base cookie recipe, and that\u2019ll be the first recipe she tackles. Christina has set up a sheet tray of basic cookie ingredients: flour, butter, sugar, and then makes a mad dash to find vanilla, corn starch, and baking powder in the dedicated Gourmet Makes pantry. In between takes, the crew breaks out into \u201cHeaven Is a Place on Earth\u201d for no discernable reason. Claire whips up a quick sabl\u00e9 dough and hands it to Dan to put in the fridge.That\u2019s a wrap. The culinary team makes a grocery list. Tyre cleans everything up. \u201cI gotta make sure the area is clean so Gaby doesn\u2019t yell,\u201d he jokes as Kevin takes down the lights.Day 2 (which is actually two weeks later)While everyone is setting up, Tyre tells me about Test Kitchen Apocalypse. It\u2019s a game Dan invented: In the event of a zombie apocalypse, and everyone\u2019s stuck in the Test Kitchen, what would you use to survive? \u201cThe goal is points for creativity,\u201d Dan clarifies. \u201cI\u2019d throw ball bearings on the floor and the zombies would slip.\u201d Claire would use the blade of a food processor as a throwing star. Or maybe a kitchen torch and can of Pam to make a flamethrower. Tyre would use a dough hook, to stab the chest of a zombie and pull the heart out.10:08 a.m.The crew camps out in a formal dining room off of the Test Kitchen where they eat lunch and store equipment. Claire is deep in thought at her laptop and doesn\u2019t hear Mike asking her a question. Dan tells him, \u201cShe\u2019s ordering emergency underpants online.\u201dClaire: \u201cFirst of all, never say \u2018underpants.\u2019 I ordered underwear and a bathing suit online, because I\u2019m going on vacation.\u201d This is Claire\u2019s first vacation in...over a year. She\u2019s been filming the show, writing a cookbook, planning a wedding. She needs this vacation.Kevin gets a hypnotizing shot of dough mixing.\nPhoto by Laura Murray11:17 a.m.Shooting has finally begun and Kevin leans it to get a shot of another batch of cookie dough swirling in the stand mixer. In the background, Sohla\u2019s making homemade HobNob cookies and the kitchen smells amazing.For some reason Dan puts on a Mardi Gras eye mask used in Chris Morocco\u2019s show Reverse Engineering (which he also directs), placing his eyeglasses over it. Claire looks up from washing her hands and shakes her head, smiling.The dough has to chill. I lose track of takes. Dan loses track of Claire when she disappears to make a phone call. Kevin starts singing \u201cpraline, praline, pra-liiiiiine,\u201d to the tune of Dolly Parton\u2019s \u201cJolene.\u201d12:29 p.m.The crew is doing the YMCA???12:33 p.m.Claire\u2019s first batch of cookies have burned and she accuses Dan of knowing they were burning. \u201cMaybe look inward when you\u2019re mad,\u201d Dan says.She makes more. Chris comes by to try them, Gaby\u2019s giving someone a piece of her mind, and Mike is mimicking curling (uh, the sport) with his big fluffy boom microphone. (\u201cThis is off the record,\u201d he tells me. No it was not). It\u2019s absolute chaos in the Test Kitchen.This crew will follow Claire to the ends of the earth\u2014and into the freezing walk-in.\u00a0\nPhoto by Laura Murray1:22 p.mWhen Claire needs cookie cutters, she starts to wander the kitchen and the crew jumps into action as if electrified. Filming starts and stops in between rolling out new cookies and putting them in the fridge to chill, and in each pause, they chat movies. Claire has recently watched all three Terminator films. Photographer Laura Murray stops by wearing her childhood Girl Scout sash complete with a square dancing patch.This spurs a discussion about which Girl Scout badges everyone would earn. \u201cAndy gets the skincare badge,\u201d says Claire. \u201cMolly gets the abbreviation badge. Gaby gets the organizing badge. Brad gets the autodidact badge.\u201d1:50 p.m.Lunch break!2:40 p.m.Culinary producer Kelly Janke sets up a brand new shiny red KitchenAid stand mixer while Kevin and Jon sing, in homage to Aretha Franklin, \u201cYou make me feel like a brand new stand mixerrrrrrrrr!\u201dDelany: Cookie opportunist.\nPhoto by Laura MurrayAs Claire works on the Thin Mint cookie dough, Delany keeps popping by to claim his badge. The \u2018tado badge? Claire wants him to pick something genuine. He struggles. \u201cThe all-around best badge? The humility badge?\u201dWhile the dough chills, everyone gathers \u2018round a laptop to watch a new Fast and the Furious trailer. Claire\u2019s eyes widen and her mouth opens into a shocked O at the stunts.3:53 p.m.Dan: \u201cThere\u2019s probably a lot of lost footage of Claire straightening her workspace. She can\u2019t work in messy conditions.\u201dDan, Tyre, and Jon with the Tagalong mold.\u00a0\nPhoto by Laura Murray4:11 p.m.Claire is using Amazing Mold Putty to make a mold for the Tagalongs while talking to Andy about J.Lo and Shakira\u2019s Super Bowl performance. Kevin warbles \u201cDan Siegel, Dan Siegel\u201d to the tune of \u201cShakira, Shakira.\u201d4:40 p.m.Dan: \u201cTake 28.\u201dClaire: \u201cIt feels like Day 28.\u201d5:30 p.m.Claire is shaving chocolate off another Tagalong so she can make a mold of the naked cookie and some of the crew are singing \u201cCome Sail Away.\u201d Mike tells me, \u201cthis is the spicy hour.\u201dFilming ends with Claire announcing her plans for the next day and answering some questions from Dan like, \u201chow do you feel about making Girl Scout cookies at this point?\u201dClaire: \u201cI know what I\u2019m doing.\u201d\u201cIf you earned one badge for today, what would it be?\u201d he asks.\u201cWorking while tired?\u201dAnd that\u2019s a wrap.Here we go.\nPhoto by Laura MurrayDay 310:42 a.m.Claire: \u201cYou know how some days, you don\u2019t know what mood you\u2019re in until you\u2019re on the subway?\u201dDan: \u201cBut what about when you\u2019re here with all your friends?\u201dClaire needs a snack and rummages for cottage cheese she left in the fridge a month ago\u2014finds it! Today she\u2019s shooting the Tagalong peanut butter filling, but first, Claire wants to clean a dirty microwave that\u2019s been driving her crazy for months, months! She grabs a bottle of spray cleaner and attacks it. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to blur this out,\u201d she says, taking the crusty microwave plate to the dish pit. Everyone groans and moans. \u201cIn case it isn\u2019t clear,\u201d Claire says, \u201cthis is more about anxiety management than anything.\u201d (Dan: \u201cIt was pretty clear to me.\u201d)She punches out Samoas and then fills the Tagalong molds with dough. She can only make three at a time.While the dough is chilling, Claire talks to Mike about Vanderpump Rules. Mike has worked on a variety of reality shows, including Real Housewives, Ghost Adventures, and \u201call the Amish shows,\u201d and has endless stories about them.12:55 p.m.A quick round of Test Kitchen Apocalypse (Dan wants to vacuum seal zombie brains out). \u201cIf there\u2019s one thing you take away from Gourmet Makes,\u201d Claire tells me, \u201cit\u2019s that we make our own fun.\u201dLunch break!2:40 pm.Conversation has shifted to conspiracy theories, the Mandela effect, and the movie Shazam! while Claire punches indentations in the Samoas and bakes Thin Mints.3:39 p.m.The hustle/bustle in the kitchen has quieted down and not a lot\u2019s happening. Claire\u2019s starting work on the Samoa caramel. Dan pulls out three types of coconut oils and she snaps up the one she needs. Editorial assistant Jesse Sparks walks by eating a giant peeled carrot.5:17 p.m.Jon offers his homemade peanut butter to Claire for use in the Samoa filling, but after she blends it with vanilla, salt, and a little water, it oozes oil. \u201cHow much oil did you add to this?\u201d she asks him, twice. Jon blushes deeply.That\u2019s it for today.Day 410:24 a.m.Claire knocks the peanut butter filling on the counter. It\u2019s hard as a rock. \u201cNot sure how I\u2019m feeling about this peanut butter\u2026\u201dJon: \u201cIf you need to use something else, I won\u2019t be hurt.\u201dKelly going through the Gourmet Makes pantry, which contains MANY types of cheese powder.\nPhoto by Laura MurrayKelly rushes to track down Claire\u2019s favorite peanut butter, Smuckers natural. Dan is telling everyone about a dream he had where he crushed a baby mouse (Dan\u2019s wife is pregnant). Mike reassures him, \u201cbabies are actually not that delicate, they can fall off the bed\u2026\u201dSomewhere along the way, the peanut butter mixture on the stove starts burning. \u201cWe don\u2019t say the \u2018b word\u2019 around here,\u201d Mike corrects me. \u201cYou mean: \u2018got some color,\u2019 \u2018pushed things a little,\u2019 \u2018this one caught,\u2019 \u2018very well done,\u2019 \u2018very caramelized,\u2019 \u2018toasty, roasty toasted.\u2019\u201d10:55 a.m.Claire begins applying caramel on the Samoas with her beloved offset spatula and Dan asks, \u201cNeed some help?\u201d Claire is the student who does the entire group project herself, so she doesn\u2019t want help. But she needs it. Otherwise this is going to take all day. Christina Chaey, Sarah Jampel, and I come in to help, and by help, I mean I broke a cookie and was banned from any more help. It\u2019s taking about four minutes per cookie because the caramel is very sticky and not very spreadable, and Claire is a perfectionist. \u201cIs this an exemplary example?\u201d asks Sarah. \u201cMaybe a little thinner,\u201d replies Claire. \u201cI don\u2019t...wanna disappoint you,\u201d Sarah says. Dan tries, and Claire says he\u2019s done \u201cirreparable damage\u201d to it. She redoes a cookie Rhoda has finished.Around 1 p.m.We break for lunch.Tiny scale, being tiny.\nPhoto by Laura Murray2:13 p.m.Everyone begins searching for \u201ctiny scale\u201d. \u201cYou know how in Sex and the City they say New York is the fifth character?\u201d Claire says. \u201cTiny scale is another character on Gourmet Makes.\u201d Rhoda helps her make a plan for the chocolate coating. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to temper,\u201d she reassures Claire.3:14 p.m.Mike cries out, \u201cClaire, Moonstruck LIVE! is sold out!\u201d Claire uses angled food tweezers to dip each Tagalong in chocolate.4:49 p.m.\u201cThis is when we do arts and crafts,\u201d says Tyre. He brings out the Girl Scout sash he bought on Amazon, 3D fabric paints, the only patch that arrived in time, which says COOKIE DIVA, and his iron from home. \u201cSometimes filming gets in the way of all the fun we\u2019re having,\u201d Claire says when she sees the paints.At a bathroom break, Claire grabs her phone and whispers to me, \u201cThis is when I check my email,\u201d and sprints away.5:19 p.m.The cookies are complete, but the kitchen is cleared out and there\u2019s no one to try them on camera. So while technically Claire finished the challenge in four days, they\u2019ll need a final day of shooting to get those reactions.Mike tries a Tagalong as Claire packs them neatly on a sheet tray. \u201cThere\u2019s a flavor I\u2019m getting...is it Jon disappointment?\u201dWhile Claire begins her elaborate decorations on the sash that\u2019s way too small on her, everyone discusses which role they\u2019d be on the Fast and the Furious (Dan is Vin Diesel, Claire is Michelle Rodriguez, Kevin is Helen Mirren, etc.). Claire uses her food tweezers to fix a mistake in her puffy paint design.6:12 p.m.The sash is complete and everyone packs up.Claire carefully plates her perfect cookies.\nPhoto by Emma FishmanDay 510:42 a.m.The Thin Mints and Tagalongs have a light splotch of oil on the tops, probably from the cocoa butter in the coating. \u201cDon\u2019t try and make me say I should have tempered it,\u201d Claire warns Dan. It\u2019s important they get the shot of her holding the original cookie next to the recreated one, cut in half to see the cross-section. Claire compliments her work: \u201cEvery element is harmonious.\u201d She takes a plate of cookies to the window to take a photo she\u2019ll post on Instagram when the episode airs.Sohla swooping in for Samoas.\nPhoto by Emma Fishman11:14 a.m.Claire goes to put on the sash but it traps her at the armpit. \u201cI need a sash extender.\u201dDan: \u201cLet\u2019s stop trying to add another two hours to the shoot.\u201dShe cuts the sash carefully along the bottom seam so it can hang over her shoulder, and Dan asks her to take cookies to the 26th floor, where the Bon App\u00e9tit editorial staff works. \u201cWhat would a Girl Scout do?\u201d he asks. \u201cThey go door-to-door selling their cookies! You gotta sell!\u201dClaire: \u201cI didn\u2019t sign on to this.\u201dWe cram into the elevator with Claire who\u2019s holding a sheet tray of cookies, gazing down at them proudly.In the office, Andy tries a cookie and gushes. \u201cThey are so tender and so proportioned.\u201d He makes a plan to tell Claire about his date later.Chris is ecstatic and at one point uses the word \u201cevanescence,\u201d and talk turns to Jon\u2019s peanut butter, which is \u201cprobably the best I\u2019ve ever had,\u201d says Chris, and Jon lights up.More staffers try cookies and Claire wants to make sure there\u2019s a plate for deputy editor Julia Kramer, who\u2019s in a meeting. Back in the kitchen, she says a few parting words about the challenge as a whole, and when it\u2019s time to say the line, \u201cthis is how you make gourmet Girl Scout cookies,\u201d she rolls her eyes deeply. One more time, requests Dan, but \u201chold the look.\u201d11:52 a.m.The episode wraps, and the crew jumps up to set up the next one: Tater Tots. The day isn\u2019t done yet.Explore Bon App\u00e9titVideoRead MorecookingClaire Saffitz Made the Apple Cake of Our DreamsBy Sarah JampelRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
