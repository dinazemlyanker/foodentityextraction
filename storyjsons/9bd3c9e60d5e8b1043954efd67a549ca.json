Not a problem.By Ashley MasonJune 22, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Chelsie CraigFacebookTwitterEmailIt\u2019s easy to wax poetic about buying meat from a sustainable source when you live close to a local butcher shop that cuts down whole, local animals every day. But what if such a spot isn\u2019t accessible? Or, for that matter, what if you just don\u2019t feel like going to another store after your trip to the market? There\u2019s only so much time in a day, especially when it\u2019d be nice to eat dinner before 10 p.m. Good news: Some of the best meat in the country is available for delivery straight to your door. Here are seven online butchers that we love, with the cuts you should be buying from them.Photo by Chelsie CraigSnake River Farms: Kurobuta Frenched Pork ChopKurobuta heritage pigs are grown for flavor, and the breed\u2019s high quantity of fat promises a juicy finish.
