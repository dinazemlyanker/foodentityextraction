Call me a sap! Just as amazing as seeing pictures of your biscuits and buns and brownies was reading all of the posts on the Basically Baking forum. You had questions! And we sometimes had answers?We may have learned more from you\u2014in terms of what recipes you\u2019d like us to develop, what information we should include, and what\u2019s tripping you up\u2014than you did from us. These are the five questions that came up over and over again, plus our best attempts at adequate responses.*Did you love the Basically Guide to Better Baking? Or not so much? Fill out our extremely brief survey\u2014we\u2019d love to hear from you!1. Can I swap this for that?I\u2019d guess that nearly half of all questions on the forum revolved around whether you could swap in what you had on hand and still make the recipe successfully. This is a) not surprising and b) perfectly reasonable, considering everyone has their own preferences, dietary restrictions, and fridge contents. This was true before the global pandemic\u2014and even more relevant now.I think that the thing to understand about baking subs, as opposed to cooking subs, is that until someone has tried it in that very recipe, it\u2019s hard to say for certain if it will work (which is why we often gave you such wishy-washy, inconclusive answers). So you\u2019ve swapped light brown sugar for dark brown sugar in a cake with no problem\u2014that\u2019s not a guarantee it won\u2019t affect your cookies.When deciding whether to make a swap, consider these questions:Is the ingredient critical to the structure, texture, and/or chemical composition of the baked good? Think: sugar, flour, eggs, fat, yeast, leaveners (baking soda/powder), dairy products like milk or yogurt. If the answer is yes, the risk of swapping is big.Or is its sole purpose flavor? Think glazes, fillings, or add-ins like nuts, chocolate, or extracts. Those aren\u2019t likely to affect the make-up of your finished product\u2014go wild!Is the ingredient you want to swap out similar to the ingredient you want to use in its place? You\u2019ll usually have the most success with something that\u2019s comparable in terms of fat, acid, protein, sugar, and moisture. A few examples tol reveal the nuance: Nuts and seeds are fatty, small, and likely exchangeable. Honey and maple syrup are both liquid sweeteners and can often, but not always, trade places. Plain yogurt and Greek yogurt can sometimes stand in for each other, but it\u2019s not guaranteed\u2014Greek yogurt is much higher in protein and lower in moisture, which could affect delicate yeasted doughs.Is my recipe relatively forgiving? Will I be okay with cookies that are too pudgy or too flat? Will I want to eat this cake if it\u2019s a little dense or tough? If the answer is \u201csure, give me anything sweet and tasty,\u201d go for it.Might it be better to choose another recipe entirely? While we\u2019d be sad to see you go, sometimes it\u2019s the right choice.No yeast? No flour? Probably can't make focaccia. :(\u00a0\nPhoto by Laura Murray, Food Styling by Susan Spungen\u00a02. I bake with Trader Joe\u2019s/Costco/Whole Foods sea salt\u2014how much should I use?Salt is giving you grief. While we develop recipes with Diamond Crystal salt (and cross-test to make sure Morton will also work), many of you asked about using salt that falls outside of these two. You want to bake with sea salt, fine sea salt, or\u2014if you\u2019re my mom\u2014iodized table salt.I encourage you to get kosher salt, but if you\u2019re working with what you have, the best way to convert between different kinds* is to measure by weight (1 Tbsp. Diamond Crystal weighs about 8 grams). This is yet another reason for us to provide you with weights for salt and for you to buy a scale so that you can actually use that information to move freely between brands.* Save finishing salts\u2014like flaky salt or that Himalayan pink sea salt you got in a Secret Santa five years ago\u2014for just that: finishing.3. Can I bake this recipe in a different pan?The answer is usually yes, but with some adjusting. The volume capacity of any pan depends on its shape and height of its sides (remember tenth grade geometry?). I use this handy guide to determine if I need to scale the recipe up or down and by what percentage. It\u2019s also important to keep in mind that changing the pan will also change the baking time\u2014more incentive to bake to the indicator, not the time and to start checking early. If your pan is bigger than the one called for and you haven\u2019t increased the amount of cake batter, for example, that batter will be spread thinner and will cook faster. (And it\u2019s always better to check too early than too late!) On the other hand, if you\u2019re using a glass pan rather than a metal one, don\u2019t be alarmed if you have to add many minutes to the baking time.We also noticed that some of you are baking in silicone pans. [Insert screaming face emoji] And while silicone is a great nonstick material, it does a REALLY bad job of conducting heat, which means your cakes and brownies and bars won\u2019t rise or brown or set up properly. Save your silicone molds for frozen desserts and sticky things like caramels and fudge. Same goes for silicone mats. While they\u2019re invaluable for certain applications, they\u2019re actually not doing your cookies any favors. Cookies baked on nonstick silicone mats will spread more compared to cookies baked on parchment. Okay, silicone rant over!Use your buckwheat to make this gorgeous galette.\u00a0\nPhoto by Stephen Kent Johnson, food styling by Rebecca Jurkevich, prop styling by Kalen Kaminski4. Where do I find buckwheat flour?So no one wants to track down buckwheat flour. Duly noted. But if you did snag some to make these buckwheat chocolate chip cookies, you could use it to make\u2026Oat and buckwheat pancakesBuckwheat banana breadChocolate and buckwheat wafflesSeeded buckwheat cookiesFruit galette with a buckwheat crust5. My cookies spread. My cake didn\u2019t rise. My focaccia didn\u2019t brown. What happened?If you\u2019ve already ruled out the other usual suspects and you followed the recipe to a T, we have one more question: Do you have an oven thermometer? If you had an inexplicably weird result, we're going to go ahead and blame your oven. We know we\u2019ve said this a million times, but if you don\u2019t have a thermometer yet, get one: It\u2019s the only way to know if you\u2019re actually baking at the recommended temp.Our baking series may be over, but the forum is still open. Even if we're slower than usual to answer questions, I'm sure your fellow bakers will be ON IT.More baking intel:1 / 10ChevronChevronThe non-negotiable, must-buy baking toolsYou know how it\u2019s okay to guess on the SATs but not on your medical history? Well it\u2019s fine to estimate when cooking\u2014a tablespoon here, a handful there\u2014but not when baking, where an extra 25\u00b0 F and \u00bc cup flour can be the difference between chewy cookies and super-thin mutants that spread into one giant Pangea. Together, a scale and an oven thermometer will eliminate risky guesswork, lighting your path to success. Here\u2019s why:\n\n\nElectronic scale: One cup of any dry ingredient varies in weight depending on how densely it\u2019s packed, but with a scale, you can make sure your measurements are correct and consistent. No more cake-like cookies or brick-like cakes. Not only will a scale save you from cleaning sets of measuring cups (tedious!), but you\u2019ll also use it for brewing coffee and figuring out how many sweet potatoes equal a pound.\u00a0Click here to read more about how food director Chris Morocco fell in love with this scale\u2014and why thinks you should have one even if you aren't a baker.\nBuy It: Escali Primo Digital Scale; $25, amazon.com\n\n\nOven thermometer: Brownie bottoms burning before the interior\u2019s cooked through? Scones slouching rather than standing straight? Sounds like you\u2019ve put too much trust in that oven dial. Unless your superpower is to detect the difference between 325 and 375\u00b0 by feel alone, a thermometer is the only way to know if your oven is actually at the right temperature, whether you\u2019re baking biscuits or roasting chicken.\u00a0\nBuy It: Rubbermaid Instant Read Monitoring Thermometer; $7, amazon.com\n\nExplore Bon App\u00e9titBasically BakingBasicallyRecipes you want to make.
