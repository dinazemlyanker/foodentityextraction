This was warranted: I was in the midst of teaching four classes, putting out a book, and buying a house. At the time, I also hated cashews.That\u2019s relevant because ultimately, cashews were my savior. I\u2019ll tell you more about that in a minute. First, you have to know about the night I bottomed out.Illustration by Sophie Lucido JohnsonAnd I lost it. Usually, I\u2019m your textbook manic depressive, with fun highs and lows that keep my life interesting. I\u2019m not a hugely anxious individual. But there was too much input. My body couldn\u2019t hold on to everything it had to do.I cried uncontrollably in the dark of our living room; my skin crawled. My thoughts ran away from me, and I desperately wanted to fix everything, but I was physically exhausted.Illustration by Sophie Lucido JohnsonUltimately, I Googled \u201cnatural ways to fix anxiety,\u201d because I wanted more than anything to be able to sleep for a whole night, and I thought something in our fridge may help.Down the rabbit hole I went. I\u2019m vegan, so salmon and yogurt\u2014the two most widely recommended dietary anxiety quellers\u2014were out. At some point, I became fixated on the idea that my body lacked zinc, and that if I could just get some more zinc in my life, all my problems would go away.Besides oysters, the big superstar in the zinc world is cashews.Illustration by Sophie Lucido JohnsonAs a vegan, I\u2019ve known for a while that I\u2019m supposed to love cashews. They\u2019re in everything that vegans make to substitute actually good foods like cheese and heavy cream. But I don\u2019t. My former roommates used to keep these chalky wasabi snacking cashews around the house, and they\u2019d munch on them all day long.Illustration by Sophie Lucido JohnsonBut on my rough Wednesday night, I got it in my head that cashews were going to solve a lot of my emotional issues. I\u2019d read a recipe for cashew milk in The Homemade Vegan Pantry that seemed too simple to possibly be true. You know how on Pinterest they\u2019re always telling you that you should make your own almond milk because it\u2019s \u201cso much better\u201d than store-bought? And then you try it and it\u2019s just, like, hunks of almonds in some water? Even after you strain it? I figured this would be that.Illustration by Sophie Lucido JohnsonIt turns out that cashews are very different from almonds. This milk was creamy, rich, and not remotely grainy. I added a little maple syrup and some cinnamon, and I was over the moon. I had coffee creamer for the rest of my life!The result was so good that I felt re-invigorated about trying other cashew recipes. Most of what I found were recipes for different kinds of \u201ccheese.\u201d Zinc-filled, vegan cheese.Illustration by Sophie Lucido JohnsonI became an evangelist for cashews, and then I started making up my own recipes. I brought my cashew creations to work.Illustration by Sophie Lucido JohnsonLet me get this out of the way right now: Cashews don\u2019t taste like cheese. If you\u2019re looking for a substitute for cheese, you\u2019re really going to have to go with other cheese. But there\u2019s something about creamed cashews that's revolutionary. They\u2019re smooth and barely sweet, and they\u2019ll inoffensively pick up any flavor you add to them.Discovering pulverized cashews was sort of like discovering riding the city bus when I was in high school. New possibilities opened up that I never could have imagined. One day, I snuck away from work early to try out a pizza recipe I couldn\u2019t stop daydreaming about. I didn\u2019t tell anyone that I was leaving.And do you know who noticed that I was ditching work to play with food?Illustration by Sophie Lucido JohnsonHere\u2019s the thing: People are mostly so wrapped up in their own lives that they spend very little time worrying about you or the tiny missteps you might make throughout the day.And suddenly, I released the idea that I had to do everything exactly right all of the time. Maybe the roof wouldn\u2019t get fixed as quickly as I wanted it to, or I\u2019d give my students their papers back a week late. Somehow, everything would be okay.A lot of cashew recipes take time because you are supposed to soak the cashews in water for at least an hour, to get them soft enough to blend totally smoothly. I got into the habit of secretly catching up on The New Yorker while I waited for my cashews to be soggy enough, under the guise of cooking. It had been so long since I\u2019d taken the time to read anything that wasn\u2019t an urgent email or a text from a contractor.Illustration by Sophie Lucido JohnsonLook. I don\u2019t know if holistic food-based approaches to mental health really do all that much. Zinc is probably not the catch-all solution to anxiety. Mental health issues are no joke, and experts\u2019 opinions vary as to how much diet is an effective way to treat them.But taking the time to make a recipe that takes hours of soaking, setting, and fermenting is fabulous for anxiety. You have to ask yourself to be patient. You have to force yourself to let go. And in the end, when you\u2019re taking a bite out of a nut-based cheesecake that has NO REFINED SUGAR (!!!!?!?!) and seems too good to be true, you are reminded, briefly, of the meaning of life.Illustration by Sophie Lucido JohnsonSophie Lucido Johnson is a writer and artist in Chicago; her illustrated memoir, Many Love, will be out in June 2018.Related: Love Is Like a Sourdough Starter\u2014It Can Last Forever, or Get Super Smelly and WeirdExplore Bon App\u00e9titCashewRead MorecultureLove Is Like a Sourdough Starter\u2014It Can Last Forever, or Get Super Smelly and WeirdBy Sophie Lucido JohnsonRecipes you want to make.
