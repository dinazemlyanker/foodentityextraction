RestaurantPollo a la Brasa is always my first meal off the plane.By Emma WartzmanJuly 29, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Pierce TwohigFacebookTwitterEmailThis is Highly Recommend, a column dedicated to our very opinionated editors\u2019 favorite things to eat, drink, and buy.After four and a half years of living in New York, there are a lot of restaurants in Los Angeles that I miss or, as someone working at this magazine, that I feel are important to try. And yet whenever I come back to my hometown, I insist that my first meal must be a golden brown\u2013skinned, deeply-spiced Peruvian rotisserie chicken from this no-frills joint in Koreatown.Stacks of hardwood line the perimeter of Pollo a la Brasa, and the aroma of chicken fat and smoke hits my nostrils before I even get inside. That\u2019s the way it\u2019s always been, or at least since my family started coming here when I was a very little kid. I grew up eating these chickens; it\u2019s been an easy weeknight staple for as long as I can remember or sometimes the star of an otherwise homemade dinner party. The garlicky skin is delicious (and so is the perfectly tender meat), but it\u2019s that smoke from the live fire that makes Pollo a la Brasa something special.Dig right in.\nPhoto by Pierce TwohigMy mom credits Nancy Silverton\u2014the chef of Mozza, Chi Spacca, and, while I was growing up, La Brea Bakery\u2014for the recommendation, but she\u2019s not the only one in the know. Jonathan Gold wrote about it back in 1996 and gave it a nod again when he put it on LA Weekly\u2019s 99 Essential Restaurants List in 2011. And that\u2019s exactly what it\u2019s become: an essential spot in in the city, mostly for people who live there, but also for out-of-towners who do their research.My move is to call ahead and order a few whole chickens and whatever sides I feel like: rice; beans; French fries; a basic green salad with cucumbers, bell peppers, and tomatoes; and the very spicy green aji sauce. I make one lucky family member drive me there and idle in the gas station across the street (parking is tough!) while I pick up the food. Then, like clockwork, the best smell in the world fills the car and I dig around the takeout bag for a chicken wing\u2014I have never ever been able to resist eating one on the way home.Go there: Pollo a la BrasaExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendLos AngelesRestaurantsRead MorerestaurantsMy Favorite Spot for Toast in Toast Town Is Actually a Pizza PlaceBy Elyse InamineRecipes you want to make.
