Without knowing exactly what I would get out of it I contacted the retreat organizers to ask if I could attend the weekend\u2019s events. Two weeks later I was sitting in a chair with my eyes closed in the middle of a log-walled room. Around me, dozens of women circled, taking turns whispering affirmations into my ear: \u201cYou are brave. You are loved. You are special.\u201d Even as I rolled my eyes, I felt myself start to cry.\u201cOh god,\u201d I thought. \u201cIt\u2019s working.\u201dI felt simultaneously defeated and relieved.The retreat, called \u201cI Am Worth It,\u201d was hosted by three wellness practitioners: a healing touch specialist, a reflexology therapist, and a naturopathic doctor. In addition to healthy meals, beach walks, and yoga, there were guided sessions that addressed letting go of past hurt, setting intentions, prioritizing self-care, and harnessing \u201cenergy centers.\u201d It costs around $333 per person to attend. The duration of the retreat is two days. Rooms were shared.Over the course of the two days, from early morning until well into the evening, women shared stories, exhaled a lot, dabbed their eyes with tissues, and formed a drumming circle under the full moon. Throughout we received advice from the practitioners, intended to help budge participants out of a rut once they returned home: make sure to get out into nature, light some scented candles while soaking in a deep tub, observe your chakras, and tell your mirrored reflection \u201cyou\u2019re beautiful\u201d over and over until you start to believe it. We whispered affirmations in each other\u2019s ears. At some point the naturopath explained that she tells clients, \u201cWe\u2019re not going to talk about weight loss, but about how your parents treated you when you were little.\u201dIt was a rollercoaster of practical and obscure, out-there woo woo nonsense and disarmingly astute observation.Wellness retreats are nothing new. Since the 2nd century B.C. and its Roman baths, people have fled to spas and health-minded resorts in an attempt to feel better. These early incarnations eventually evolved into the spa model of Golden Door in San Marcos, California, and Canyon Ranch in Tucson, Arizona, both of which offered opulent surroundings coupled with rigorous training geared toward weight loss and physical transformation. By the mid 2000s yoga retreats filled up Instagram feeds with photos of virtuous-looking activities, sun salutations on the beach, and fit people inhaling huge amounts of avocado.[Retreats] grant women permission to prioritize their needs\u2014promising that a greater sense of personal fulfillment will follow.And today\u2019s retreat culture has moved past the \u201close weight, feel great\u201d mentality, beyond a week of yoga and vegan meals in Puerto Vallarta, and squarely into the realm of self-empowerment.These new retreat goers aren\u2019t focused on losing weight, rehabbing, or escaping their problems. They\u2019re packing their emotional baggage and heading to places like Renew Breakup Bootcamp in upstate New York, a broken-heart retreat that helps women address subconscious patterns that keep them from the love they really deserve. At a Purpose in Paris retreat, participants cast negative self-talk into the Seine and make \u201cself-worth vows\u201d at the iconic lovelock bridge. In Miami, there are vision-boarding and manifesting retreats to help pinpoint \u201climiting beliefs\u201d and evict the \u201cresident shit-talker living in your head.\u201d And one Costa Rica retreat combines self-defense, mindfulness, and self-care with the promise that \u201cyour inner warrior princess is waiting to be unleashed into the world.\u201d\u201cI believe people are understanding their need to turn focus inward and shine a light on the dark parts of themselves that maybe they weren't willing to face before,\u201d says Jennifer Sembler, whose Yemanya Travel company offers retreats for women with \u201ca 360-degree approach to mind, body, and spirit,\u201d including hiking, meditation, and life coaching sessions. \u201cThis search for inner peace and truth is one of the driving forces behind this retreat movement,\u201d she says.Beth McGroarty, director of the nonprofit, research-oriented Global Wellness Institute, says that self-empowerment retreats for women have exploded in the last few years. And, overall, businesses that cater to all-female getaways have dramatically increased in popularity. McGroarty, who keeps tabs on these things, says that AdventureWomen, which has been in business for over 35 years, reported 42 percent growth in the last year, and that Wild Women Expeditions has grown by 1,000 percent since 2010 and doubled profits since early 2018.These new retreats are part of a broader cultural interest in self-care, a concept that has displaced the more rigid-sounding \u201cself-improvement\u201d in recent years. They cater to women primarily, and those with enough privilege to spend hundreds or thousands of dollars (and vacation days) on personal growth, mental health, or healing. Sara Elise, co-founder of Blind Seed, a company that hosts inclusive urban wellness workshops and retreats, says that these retreats tend to appeal to \u201cwhite women with small, able bodies and deep pockets,\u201d and that she and co-founder Tara Aura were inspired to launch their business because she had \u201cnever been to a wellness retreat with more than one person of color in a leadership position.\u201dBut McGroarty also points to broad demographic changes to explain this phenomenon: Women are\u00a0marrying later and less often, having fewer if any children, and have far greater purchasing power than ever before. Then there's the rise of fourth-wave feminism (which is commonly associated with online activism, the #MeToo movement, body positivity, and the intersections of race, gender, sex and class), the failures of conventional healthcare to address women\u2019s needs and concerns, an increasingly on-demand work culture, the gender pay gap, toxic social media, and generalized anxiety about economic stability and impending environmental catastrophe. All these factors are likely driving women to prioritize\u00a0psychological wellness. \u201cThere\u2019s\u00a0a kind of zeitgeist right now of female empowerment, bonding, and transformation,\u201d says McGroarty.Back at I Am Worth It, healing touch practitioner Jeanette Gormley blamed the zeitgeist on a toxic environment for womanhood\u2014the constant swirl of negativity, the high expectations and demand for conformity, the disproportionate burden we often take on in our domestic lives. Elaine Falconer, who lives in River John, Nova Scotia and recently retired from her job as an occupational health and safety specialist, told me she was hoping the weekend would help her gain greater clarity. \u201cWomen put high expectations on themselves and don\u2019t take enough time for self-reflection,\u201d she said, facing the big stone fireplace at the front of our log-walled room. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a process to prioritize what I need and not what others need from me.\u201dGetting in touch with a suppressed or silenced interior life is a common goal among participants. Ali Wunderman, 29, a Montana-based travel journalist, attended a retreat in 2017 offered by The Storyteller Within, in Guatemala, where the emphasis was on writing. Over the course of ten days, at $1,595 USD for a shared cabana, attendees practiced meditation and yoga, ate plant-based communal meals, participated in Mayan fire ceremonies and cacao-induced \u201cecstatic dance.\u201d And says, Wunderman, daily group therapy sessions. The various components contributed to a transformative experience. \u201cDoing all that yoga put me back in touch with my body and its needs,\u201d she says. \u201cThat healthy food cleared my mind so I could think more deeply. Being with a trusted group of formerly-unknown-to-me women created the space I needed to trust my vulnerability.\u201dWunderman sees the growth of self-empowerment retreats as part of a mass awakening. \u201cWomen are recognizing their individual power and their communal power and taking it back for the sake of liberation,\u201d she says. \u201cI don't think it's just because we want to, or just because it feels good: I believe a global shift is taking place in which we recognize we need to.\u201dMany women say that they\u2019re paying for the chance to step away from the competing needs of work, families, relationships, and daily life maintenance and simply hear themselves think again. Nathalie Schofield, a 39-year-old communications advisor who lives in Eastern Passage, Nova Scotia, attended the I Am Worth It retreat after going through a divorce. When I spoke to her several weeks after the retreat, she told me that a \u201cspirit guide\u201d emerged to her during the evening drumming session.\u201cI was very angry and bitter and I knew I had to let go of something or change something,\u201d she says. The drumming ceremony was just before a \u201creleasing\u201d ceremony, and as Schofield held her hands out she felt a spirit grasp them, followed by the sensation of hands on her shoulders. \u201cI suddenly realized that I had to let go of trying to control everything,\u201d she says. She thanked her spirit guides, took a piece of paper and wrote the word \u201ccontrol,\u201d threw it into the fire pit and then \u201cbawled like a baby.\u201dAs the gray and angry Atlantic Ocean lapped the shore of Nova Scotia, I began to glean why the women who can afford it are spending hundreds and thousands of dollars to take this particular kind of break. It was a temporary release from a socially endorsed obsession with external presentation in favor of interior experience\u2014and at a time when so many women are so overwhelmingly worn out. The positive talk\u2014being \u201cworth it\u201d; advocating for laughter as medicine\u2014is the counterbalance to a constant swirl of negativity. The emphasis on \u201cnatural\u201d and \u201cholistic,\u201d on beeswax candles and tucking dried lavender under your pillow, is a panacea for our increasingly toxic plastic world. But even more, they grant women permission to prioritize their needs\u2014promising that a greater sense of personal fulfillment will follow.But what happens after these retreats? Do the spirit guides and the renewed commitments to self-care remain? Can an exercise in female empowerment in the presence of accepting female strangers translate to a more nurtured, calm, healthy, whole woman walking back into her office?For many of the women (including me) who attend these retreats, it seems unlikely that substantial life changes can be prompted in just one very expensive, self-soothing weekend. Most go back to the same lives that made us feel stuck in the first place. And while they purport to be feminist in their approach to self-empowerment, these retreats tend to emphasize practices like journaling, manifestation, and individual desires rather than building a more equitable society that doesn\u2019t drain women so much in the first place. What would a retreat have to do to begin to accomplish that?Sara Elise makes the case that some retreats can help prepare women for the hard work of broader social change. \u201cIf we can use the support systems in a retreat setting to make room for expansion, we often come home with a greater capacity for the emotional labor and work required of us in the world,\u201d she says. \u201cRetreats that prioritize marginalized people can give all kinds of activists and oppressed people a chance to recalibrate with new questions, new perspectives and time away from the usual challenges of everyday life.\u201dThe retreat I attended sometimes made me feel even more cynical and impatient. I quickly grew weary of being told to hug myself in front of the mirror or being asked to join a circle. Like so many other women, I am often very tired and I didn\u2019t really want to talk about how essential oils or spending more time in the tub might help solve my problems. What exactly were we accomplishing?But when an exercise involving Tibetan Rites pivoted to a discussion of mothers and boundaries, I was instantly struck by the universality of experiences being expressed, and the difficulty of trying to feel your way around a relationship with someone you love who sometimes hurts you. A number of women nodded along when one attendee said she recently told her mother to \u201cgo fuck herself.\u201dNot unlike group therapy, it was the kind of environment where a participant simply benefits from feeling heard and recognizing their own experience in another\u2019s story. The kind of meaningful exchange we\u2019re sometimes short on while going through the busy motions of day-to-day life.I wasn\u2019t the only one who cried during the affirmation exercise in Nova Scotia. The tissue boxes were there for a reason. Maybe you don\u2019t always know what you need to hear until a stranger whispers it in your ear. And maybe, for some women, that\u2019s the first step to figuring out what\u2019s missing.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishSelf CareTrendsRead MoreLifestyle5 Healthy Trips for People Who Hate Wellness RetreatsGallery5 SlidesBy Mackenzie WagonerRecipes you want to make.
