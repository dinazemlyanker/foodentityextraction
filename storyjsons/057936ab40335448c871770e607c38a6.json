Great nutty taste, great texture. Next time I'll add a couple of tbsp of honey!lemikeMontr\u00e9al, Canada3/2/2019It was entirely too salty! Either it was a mistake or the writer of this recipe needs to cut back on her salt intake.  I will try it again though. I had everything on hand and it was fairly easy.  I loved the texture.AnonymousOK2/10/2019Are the white sesame seeds hullled or unhulled?Anonymous2/4/2019It came out really salty.  I wonder if the tablespoon of salt on the ingredient list was a misprint. I gave it two stars because my dog likes it!AnonymousRidgefield, CT1/20/2019Explore Bon App\u00e9titBreadFlaxseedSeedTahiniCondiments, Sauces & PastesSnackGluten-FreeDairy-FreeVegetarianHealthyishBakingRecipes you want to make.
