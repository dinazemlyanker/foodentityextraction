Making the cheese fine is crucial in ensuring that it melts into the cake instead of turning clumpy and rubbery as it bakes.Ingredients8 - 10 Servings1cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, melted, slightly cooled, plus more2\u00bdcups all-purpose flour1Tbsp. baking powder\u00betsp. Diamond Crystal or \u00bd tsp. Morton kosher salt7large eggs2cups sugar\u00betsp. vanilla extract3cups finely grated Cotija cheese1cup whole milk\u00bccup sesame seedsFlaky sea saltPreparationStep 1Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 375\u00b0. Butter an 18x13\" rimmed baking sheet. Whisk flour, baking powder, and kosher salt in a medium bowl. Separate eggs, placing yolks in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and whites in a small bowl.Step 2Add sugar and vanilla to egg yolks and beat on medium-high speed until very pale and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Reduce speed to medium, add cheese and beat just to combine. Reduce speed to low. Add milk in 3 additions, incorporating completely after each addition before adding more. With motor running, stream in 1 cup melted butter and beat until combined. Gradually add dry ingredients and beat until combined, about 1 minute. Scrape batter into a large bowl.Step 3Thoroughly clean and dry mixer bowl. Combine egg whites and a pinch of salt in bowl. Using whisk attachment, beat, starting on medium-low speed and gradually increasing to medium-high, until tripled in volume and medium peaks form, about 2 minutes.Step 4Add half of egg whites to batter and fold in with a rubber spatula until no streaks remain. Repeat with remaining egg whites. Scrape batter into prepared baking sheet. Sprinkle sesame seeds, then sea salt over. Bake, rotating halfway through, until a tester inserted into the center comes out clean, 24\u201328 minutes. Let cool slightly. Run an offset spatula or paring knife around edges. Slide out onto a cutting board; cut into 3\" squares.Step 5Do ahead: Quesadilla can be baked 3 days ahead.

My mom loved it and so did my brother and his boyfriend. Definitely making this again as it used to be a big part of my childhood. Im mexican and guatemalan but my grandma would make it sometimes when i was little.MansonRancho Cucamonga,CA1/29/2022I'm salvadorean and this is one of my favorite sweet breads ever. Another traditional way of making this recipe in some parts of the country is with rice flour, which is a great gluten free alternative.JuliaSan Salvador, El Salvador8/31/2021So tasty! Love the savory and not too sweet flavor... And such a great texture. This full recipe makes a ton for a household of three, but they freeze wonderfully. Much praise from friends and family who have been gifted a square or two from time to time! It's the perfect treat to have on hand. Ready to make my next batch!Nicole STruckee, CA4/25/2021Perfect For those who are trying to avoid to- sweet recipes. Also enjoyable with Cotija cheeseRicardo SandovalMexico City3/9/2021These were just delicious. My husband eats them warmed for breakfast, and unheated for dessert. I would not normally make a full recipe, but in this case, because they are so versatile, I did. Highly recommended and highly addictive. Thank you for opening this cuisine to us.Kathleen BakerBrewster, MA1/9/2021Delicious! I added some coconut shavings on top for added flavor and texture Miami10/26/2020Subbed feta and halved the recipe to fit in a 8x8 ceramic, otherwise made as stated.
