I am vegan/vegetarian and my hubby is French, a meat eater.  We both loved this salad, I used tomatoes, green beans, potatoes, lentils with copious amounts of the sauce, and briny things like capers. In France you don't put asparagus into a NIcoise but you can put cooked green beans, tomatoes and potatoes and the lentils - It is a go to meal when I make a bunch of lentils.  Then I double or triple up on making the sauce so that I can throw it on diced beets or gartered carrots or boiled leeks... so so good.  I have made this recipe at least 10x (each time without the asparagus somehow the lentils were a hell-yes but after living in France for over a decade I just could not do it with the asparagus.French Jamaican US YogiFoodieNew Rochelle, NY11/12/2021Very saucyJSChicago, IL7/20/2021The vinaigrette makes this a wow dish!  It was so good that I made it twice in the same week. My husband is a meat eater and he loved it.  He works from home a lot and when I have a lot of work I do this.  I plate the veggies in advance then pour the sauce in before eating.\nWendyPeloYogiNew Rochelle, NY4/24/2021Explore Bon App\u00e9titSaladFrenchEuropeanEggAsparagusVegetableBlack LentilLentilFrench LentilSpringSummerQuickEasyWeeknight MealsMainDairy-FreeGluten-FreeVegetarianHealthyishLunchDinnerRecipes you want to make.
