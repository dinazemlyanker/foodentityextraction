Lining the skillet with cabbage wedges allows them to catch every drop of the rich juices as they become melt-in-your-mouth tender. While the chicken roasts, there is plenty of time to make fragrant rice with the leftover coconut milk and slices of ginger. This dish was inspired by the rotisserie chicken from the now closed Uncle Boon\u2019s, one of my favorite restaurants in New York. They had it on rotating spits with heads of cabbage to catch all the juices. This at home version with thighs is a more approachable way to highlight all those good flavors. \u2014Diana YenAll products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Roasted cabbage always wins. Half a Serrano pepper in the leftover sauce goes a long way.Lanuchan3/25/2022Really tasty.  The sauce pulls it all together!KateSanta Monica, CA3/21/2022Great recipe! Like others I added red pepper flakes. Will definitely make this  one again.Mountainman NorCal 3/6/2022This one's a keeper! A little red pepper flakes is a nice addition.  Anonymous2/27/2022Shockingly rich and well rounded / complex flavor for relatively little effort. Outstanding cabbage. A delightful combination that I will use to introduce people to the wonders of fish sauce. JaycSeattle2/22/2022Braising is my new favorite cooking technique. I marinated the chicken for about 2 hours and it was delicious. Husband asked that it get added to the rotation. I agree that this dish needs some heat. Served with chili garlic sauce. Perfect. Jenna C. California 2/9/2022Soooo delicious, the chicken was so tender and the rice and cabbage were perfectAnonymousPhx Az2/3/2022A good basic recipe but to make it Thai, it needs a few more ingredients - lemongrass, lime leaves, and most importantly, a chili or two. I will give it a try with these additions.TuvaVancouver1/27/2022Delicious. Definitely needs more cabbage to sop up the fantastic juices. I sprinkled the seasoned cabbage base with red pepper flakes, which gave it just a little pop of heat. Loved the coconut rice. A really terrific dish.VickiVancouver, Canada1/24/2022After I made this my husband said - this is the best executed dish you\u2019ve made in over a year. It came together quickly and easily and was flavorful. My 10 month old loved it. I only had boneless skinless so added those after the cabbage had roasted for 15 minutes. I also added in the marinade with the chicken to the cabbage mixture. Next time I would use an entire head of cabbage and probably add some Serrano or jalape\u00f1o.AJSeattle1/19/2022This works.   The cabbage part was intriguing which is always a hook for me.  When I saw the marinade and the set aside juice I decided to cook them both up.  Glad I did as (of course) it had a great taste and silky texture. Perfectly safe - not any different from cooking raw meat in a typical Thai curry.  And anyway the set aside juice looked thin and unattractive.  AnonymousVaison La Romaine  1/18/2022Wonderful recipe! Lovely flavour combination, our entire family enjoyed including my 3 year old who can be a bit picky. Great use for the humble cabbage as the cooking method brings all the flavours together when braising - turns out SO GOOD. If you're hesitating on trying this, do not, it's one of my favourite recipes from the many I've made over the years from B.A. Diana Yen, you are a superstar for sharing this recipe with us.. thank you!NicoleCanada1/13/2022Made this tonight and it was excellent! Only used 1/3 cup of brown sugar and that was definitely enough sweetness. Used brown jasmine rice so had to supplement the remaining coconut milk with water and some more salt but was still delicious. Absolutely making this again.JamieWashington, DC1/11/2022Yesterday was a disaster in the kitchen. Including not realizing I should have been marinating this chicken while I reworked my meal prep lunches plan since I forgot two of the main ingredients for the intended recipe. \n\nSO: marinated the chicken for a wee bit while reloaded dishwasher and prepped rice. Patted chicken dry and seared it. After chicken was crisped up, set it to the side, poured off some of the oil, and seared cabbage in the pan. Then added chicken back on top, pouring in the marinade. Brought to boil, then tossed in oven \u2018til chick was at temp. SO GOOD. And the rice?? Ridiculous. Will be doing this again ASAP. AnnWinston-Salem, NC1/10/2022Awesome recipe! I made it for the family before the holidays and it was delicious.  My wife and I went back on  low carb after  New Years, so last night made it with SPLENDA subbed for sugar and added fresh French green beans w/ the cabbage, and we hardly missed the rice--delicious.Anonymousmorehead city, nc1/6/2022Explore Bon App\u00e9titThaiSoutheast AsianAsianChicken ThighChickenPoultryCoconut MilkOther IngredientsGreen CabbageCabbageLeafy GreensVegetableRiceRice & GrainsEasyMainDairy-FreeGluten-FreeSimmerRoastDinnerRecipes you want to make.
