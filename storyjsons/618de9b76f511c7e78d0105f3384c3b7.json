They\u2019re here for the buttery croissants, traditional white-and-black conchas, flaky pain au chocolat, and the famed guava rolls filled with creamy ricotta. All beautiful pastries, which need restocking at the bakery, by chef Elena Reygadas.Down the street, a stream of bakers run out of Rosetta, Reygadas\u2019 Italian-inspired restaurant, carrying trays of the baked goods into La Panader\u00eda. Reygadas, 42, joins the parade of pastries. She stands just a little over five feet tall and wears a wool sweater and bell-bottom jeans\u2014no chef coat or clogs in sight. She\u2019s just dropped off her two daughters at the elementary school a few blocks away, and now she\u2019s in work mode. Carefully moving through the busy and tiny kitchen of La Panader\u00eda, Reygadas checks on an extra tangy sourdough made with pulque and talks to a cook about a candied pumpkin pastry idea.A cross-section of a croissant.\nPhoto by Cody JamesReygadas seamlessly weaves together Mexican ingredients with French and Italian techniques\u2014this is what makes her growing restaurant empire in Mexico City so groundbreaking. \u201cShe has become one of the main pillars of modern Mexican cuisine,\u201d says Enrique Olvera, the chef behind Pujol in Mexico City and Cosme in New York. \u201cShe\u2019s expressing a different kind of Mexican cuisine. Fusion, nuanced, whatever you call it. At the end of the day, it shows you don\u2019t need to follow a formula to be successful.\u201dReygadas grew up in La Herradura, a quiet neighborhood in the western part of the city, and she learned how to cook from her grandmother during big family gatherings. \u201cThe kitchen was my grandma\u2019s domain and I always helped her,\u201d she tells me. After studying English literature in college, she started catering on-set for her filmmaker-brother Carlos Reygadas\u2019s first movie. The team was half European and half Mexican, and she had to find a way to make everyone happy. In the end, Reygadas cooked two differents menus\u2014but her pulque bread, then a home experiment before it became a restaurant staple, was a success all around.\u201cThat was the moment I knew I wanted to become a cook,\u201d she says.Reygadas in the kitchen at Rosetta.\nPhoto by Cody JamesSo, she moved to New York City to study at the International Culinary Center, where she fell in love with baking bread and making pasta by hand. She went on to work at Locanda Locatelli, a Michelin-starred Italian restaurant in London. Here she cemented her love of Italian cooking\u2014mostly because of the country\u2019s respect for the best-quality produce\u2014before returning to Mexico City.Initially, she started cooking private dinners for friends and then hosted pop-up events, where her clients were mostly friends and family since what she was doing was technically illegal. As her secret dinners started to fill up and, as she dug deeper into Mexican ingredients like epazote and hoja santa and transformed them into gnocchi or salads, she realized she needed a more permanent home. So, in 2010, she opened Rosetta. It was a hit, especially among the local gallery crowd. \u201cAt that time, the restaurant scene was not very active in the neighborhood, so customers were curious and more accepting,\u201d she told me.Inside Rosetta.\nPhoto by Cody JamesAt 10 a.m., Reygadas hits Lardo, her casual caf\u00e9, and tries the oven-baked oatmeal. \u201cThis was one of our first dishes we put on the menu,\u201d she tells me. \u201cIt\u2019s quite heavy due to the variety of grains, but with the wild berries and almond milk, it actually makes a perfect breakfast.\u201d After, she stops by Caf\u00e9 Nin, her newest restaurant with a more fast casual focus (salads, sandwiches, of course some pastries). Chef de cuisine Heriberto Gutierrez gives her a new dish to try: beetroot salad with slivers of mandarin, a dollop of ricotta cheese, and torn basil. \u201cWe can actually change the ricotta with some coconut yogurt we just made at Rosetta. I think it will have a better balance,\u201d she tells him.Dishes at Rosetta ready to go out to diners.\nPhoto by Cody JamesIt\u2019s that intense attention to detail, fearless experimentation, and constant curiosity that makes Reygadas a formidable force in Mexico City. It wasn\u2019t until she won the Best Female Chef for the Latin American edition of World\u2019s 50 Best in 2014\u2014before the public outcry over the very existence of the award\u2014that she started getting more recognition. Her name started coming up in conversation alongside Olvera and Gabriela C\u00e1mara, and young cooks began asking to stage and work in her kitchens.\u201cHer food is so sophisticated and delicate,\u201d says Gabriela Renteria, a Mexican food journalist, best known for her work in Food & Wine ES and Letras Libres, the literature and culture periodical. \u201cThat\u2019s what has made her one of the biggest figures in contemporary Mexican cuisine.\u201dBy late afternoon, we\u2019re back at Rosetta, just as the staff starts to prepare for dinner service. Everyone sits down to debrief about service the day before, then Reygadas and the front-of-house team fold napkins and wipe down wine glasses. As the first guests arrive, Reygadas heads back into the kitchen. She stands at the pass, checking on the cucumber salad topped with creamy jocoque (Mexican sour milk), and beef tongue drizzled with a sauce made of chicatana ants. She follows the food out into the dining room, watching as customers dig in, later on wandering over to ask how it was.Forming ravioli.\nPhoto by Cody JamesShe doesn\u2019t return to the kitchen until an hour and a half later, when she\u2019s alerted of a customer request: a cheeseless ravioli. Focused and methodical, she experiments with a filling of  lemon zest, lemon thyme, and butter. \u201cI actually appreciate special requests,\u201d she says. \u201cIt makes me realize there is so much more you can do with ingredients.\u201dAfter testing more new dishes, at 4 p.m. Reygadas runs back to her daughters\u2019 elementary school to pick them up and quickly drop them off at home before returning to Rosetta once more. She does a walk-through of pastry production for tomorrow and calls it a day at 5:30 p.m. It\u2019s been a whirlwind, checking in on all her restaurants and constantly tweaking ideas and dishes along the way. But Reygadas wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.\u201cAfter living in New York and London, I realize how fortunate I am to live here and to have access to all these wonderful ingredients,\u201d Reygadas tells me. \u201cThat\u2019s the new wave of modern Mexican restaurants, a mix of traditional and contemporary techniques without forgetting the most important thing: our roots.\u201dExplore Bon App\u00e9titMexico CityCity GuidesChefsRestaurants + TravelRecipes you want to make.
