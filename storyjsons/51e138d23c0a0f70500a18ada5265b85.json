This Home Cook Fought the Law\u2014and WonDanielle Mickelson made the case that home-based food businesses like hers are safe and economically vital.\u00a0By Meleyna NomuraFebruary 22, 2021FacebookTwitterEmailIllustration by Cynthia KittlerFacebookTwitterEmailThis story is from\u00a013 Ways to Launch the Food Business of Your Dreams, where women entrepreneurs share their experiences and best advice on turning a passion for food into a career.Danielle Mickelson sold around 2,000 quarts of pickles, 650 loaves of bread, and 225 pies last year\u2014all made in her kitchen in Rolla, North Dakota, a small town about 10 miles from the Canadian border. Though she runs a farmers market with her husband, Mickelson is able to earn additional income from her cooking thanks to cottage food laws, laws that allow people to sell food products cooked in their own homes rather than in commercial kitchens. Every state has its own cottage laws, and while the exact legislation varies, it typically covers the sale of nonperishable baked goods and snacks only\u2014things like nut mixes, granolas, and pickles. But in 2017 the North Dakota legislature passed the Food Freedom Act (HB-1433). Modeled after a Wyoming bill passed two years earlier, this new law extended the list of approved foods to include cooked dishes made with vegetables and poultry (no red meat), perishable baked goods, and more.For Mickelson the new law was life-changing. \u201cMy family and friends weren\u2019t the only ones who liked my products; I had regular customers and increasing demand,\u201d she recalls. \u201cAnd that\u2019s when the exponential growth started.\u201d She began making pies and soups with her homegrown vegetables to sell alongside her freshly baked bread. The success of these new products made Mickelson look into buying a commercial kitchen and encouraged her to join the local job development authority to help others in the community take advantage of the same opportunities.Danielle Mickelson successfully championed cottage laws in North Dakota.\nPhoto courtesy Institute for JusticeHB-1433 was a huge win for anyone with cooking skills but with limited or no access to traditional avenues of entrepreneurship\u2014especially women and immigrants, along with Black, Indigenous, and rural communities. These groups have always been responsible for feeding their communities, and the new law enabled them to do so in a legal and profitable way. It also allowed them to expand their offerings and share their food with a broader swath of customers. Since the law was enacted, the North Dakota Department of Health has been pushing back, asking the state legislature to again legalize nonperishable foods only. Its requests were denied, but in late 2019 the health department circumvented the system and implemented new rules that prohibited home producers from selling perishable meals. \u201cA lot of health departments, not just in North Dakota, think the solution to everything is to regulate,\u201d speculates Erica Smith, a senior attorney with the Institute for Justice, a nonprofit civil liberties law firm, who represented Mickelson in a recent lawsuit. \u201cWhen you have the hammer, everything looks like a nail.\u201dThe department\u2019s rules hugely impacted Mickelson\u2019s business as well as her work in local job development. Throughout the state, some producers lost their entire businesses due to the restrictions; COVID-19 put many families in precarious economic positions. But Mickelson fought back. She, along with four other plaintiffs, worked with Smith to file a lawsuit against the North Dakota Department of Health. In December they won and home producers were able to resume sales of all food covered by HB-1433.Smith believes that laws like these are the future. \u201cCottage food laws have only been around for about 30 years,\u201d she says. \u201cBut people have been selling homemade food for hundreds of years. And since COVID-19, home-based businesses are taking off. It\u2019s the shared-economy model: People want to buy locally and they want to buy from their neighbors.\u201d Winning the case provided not only relief for Mickelson and her budding business but an opportunity to empower her community in a new way. \u201cWe all have our niche, but we all grow together,\u201d Mickelson says. \u201c[This law] gives us the chance to expand.\u201dFeeling inspired?
