Inside or out, you\u2019ll still have buttery clams to enjoy.Ingredients4 servings\u00bdlemon5garlic cloves, 1 whole, 4 thinly sliced\u00bdcup mayonnaiseKosher salt\u00bccup plus 3 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil2large shallots, thinly sliced1red chile (such as Holland or Fresno), thinly sliced, or \u00bd tsp. crushed red pepper flakes2Tbsp. tomato paste2cups cherry tomatoes1cup dry white wine36littleneck clams, scrubbed6Tbsp. unsalted butter, cut into pieces3Tbsp. finely chopped chives4thick slices country-style breadPreparationStep 1Prepare a grill for medium heat.

Didn\u2019t have tomato paste just used tomatoes  and no have shallots on hand so we used chives. It still turned out delicious and hit the right spotTabbiePhoenix,AZ9/1/2021Outstanding! Not a big clam fan but this changed my mind. I did it on the stovetop and used basil instead of chives. It was amazing. Savannah Chattanooga, TN1/15/2021This was absolutely delicious. I doubled the sauce and added clams, scallops, shrimp, and cod and served it over linguine. A top ten meal. I'm making it again tonight and can't wait. (I made it on my stovetop.)HenderKevinsonCA10/12/2020This is an amazing grilled clam recipe.  I do not eat it with the mayo but love the sauce and sopping it up with grilled sourbread.  I also cut the butter in half (3TBLS).  You will not be disappointed!AnonymousNew Jersey8/18/2019Amazing recipe, used 2 Thai chilies and it was nice heat without overwhelming the dish. Subed cherry stone clams but this would also be great with mussels. Made the mayo and it filled a void in the meal with the acid but definitely didn\u2019t use as much as the recipe calls forAnna297/19/2019Outstanding!! I loved the broth, couldn\u2019t find the chile so I used red pepper flakes instead. Perfect balance of flavors and spiciness. Didn\u2019t make the mayo since I\u2019m not a huge mayo fan.nick016NYC6/4/2019This is amazing. Skipped the mayo  - but I'm sure that would add another element to this but didn't need the extra calories. This sauce is simple and really delivers. Anonymous6/2/2019Sauce was delicious. My husband is on a low sodium diet, so didn't use it with bread, instead put it over spiralized zucchini for me and whole wheat pasta for him. I plan to make the sauce again and perhaps poach a piece of fish in it!
