You love it. But what is ricotta cheese, really? Let's learn about the fluffiest cheese in the land.By Alex DelanyApril 24, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Chelsea KyleFacebookTwitterEmailIf the Italian word ricotta doesn\u2019t translate to glorious, fluffy cheese clouds in English, I\u2019d like to speak to someone about changing that. Because that\u2019s exactly what ricotta is: light, spongy, creamy, glorious fresh cheese. You might be a ricotta fanatic. Or you might dabble on occasion. But do you really know what ricotta\u2019s deal is? What is ricotta cheese, really?Well, let\u2019s start with what it\u2019s made from. Ricotta can technically be made from the milk of cows, sheep, goats, or water buffalo, but the ricotta that we consume most frequently\u2014the stuff you can buy at almost every grocery store\u2014is made from the milk of a cow. But historically, that cows milk was used for something else before it was used to make ricotta. Sorry, is that confusing? Allow me to explain.So, ricotta actually translates to recooked in Italian, and ricotta is what\u2019s called a \"whey cheese.\" When you make cheese, you separate milk into two distinct things. You have the solids, called curds, which will be separated out and pressed to form cheese. And you have the liquid that is left behind, called whey. Most cheeses that we know and love are made from the curds but, traditionally at least, ricotta is made from the tiiiiiny bit of curd left behind in the whey.Cheesemakers make whatever cheese they want to make with the curds, and then repurpose the leftover whey to create ricotta (among other whey cheeses). To do this, the whey is heated\u2014usually after a small addition of whole milk and some form of vinegar or citrus juice\u2014and the remaining curds start to coagulate. The curds will become larger and more solid and, eventually, the pot will be emptied into a portion of cheesecloth and strained. Once the cheese cloth is emptied of any remaining whey, you\u2019ll be looking at a bunch of fluffy, white ricotta.This is how ricotta is traditionally made; it's a way to put all that leftover whey to good use. But these days, at least in the States, we tend to make ricotta from whole milk instead of whey. In this case, the process is the same as making any other cheese\u2014you heat the milk, coagulate it in some way, and then strain the curds from the whey to form a soft, fresh, spreadable cheese product.Ricotta dip! It's really, really good!\nPhoto by Chelsea KyleThe main thing to take away from this whole process is that ricotta is a fresh cheese. There\u2019s still a ton of moisture in ricotta. As a general rule, the older a cheese is, the less moisture it will have retained. An aged cheese like Parmesan is hard and dense. Since the ricotta we use at home isn\u2019t aged at all, it\u2019s light and moist, and also much more perishable than drier cheesesSo that\u2019s how ricotta is made. But what do you do with it? Well, lasagna filling is a good place to start. Or maybe some stuffed shells or manicotti. But ricotta is also a fantastic ingredient to add straight-up to a dish. Dollops of ricotta on top of pasta, soup, or pizza bring freshness (and definitely more richness) instantly. A swipe of ricotta over toast should be your official substitute for cream cheese, especially with some cracked black pepper and a drizzle of honey. You can make it into a dip with herbs and spices, and ricotta with almost any in-season fruit is guaranteed to be a killer dessert.Really, you can use ricotta in many instances in which you might otherwise use yogurt. It\u2019s the cheese that can do both! And while you do know how it\u2019s made, there\u2019s no pressure to tell everyone you meet. You can just enjoy the pillow-y fresh cheese, keeping the thoughts of curds and whey to yourself.Here's that lasagna you asked for:Basically Skillet LasagnaFinally: an easy, cheesy, vegetarian(!) lasagna recipe that doesn't require you to dirty every pot and pan in your kitchen.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titBasicallyCheeseRicottaRecipes you want to make.
