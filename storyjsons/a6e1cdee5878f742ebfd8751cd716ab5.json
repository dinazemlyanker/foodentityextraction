Want me to heat my skillet or oven? Prepare an ambitious recipe? Call me in November, when fall actually begins in Texas and my mood can no longer be described as \u201csweaty.\u201d That\u2019s why, this summer, my Royal Gourmet flattop grill has been my savior. Dinner is ready in the time it takes to chop a head of broccoli, and the only tools to clean are a squeeze bottle of water and a spatula. It flawlessly delivers the wok hei of a Hong Kong street hawker, and more important, it brings me back to my ultimate childhood comfort food: food court takeout from Sarku Japan, a teppanyaki chain found almost exclusively in malls across America.In the sprawling suburbs of Cypress, Texas, just northwest of Houston, summers are best described by their duality\u2014the heat of the Gulf Coast (demonstrated by the Texas Neapolitan, sunburned on top, pale in the middle, finished with a distinctive Old Navy flip-flop tan on the bottom) and the cool of the shopping mall, where it\u2019s always a brisk 65 degrees. The mall raised me, from when I was five running around permanently sticky play places to when I was 13 going on Forever 21. It\u2019s in my DNA\u2014even my prom was at the mall. And while some kids were raised on PB&J or Little Caesars\u2019 Hot-N-Readys, I grew up on Sarku Japan. On every visit to Willowbrook Mall, my mom and I would split a $5.69 styrofoam box of teriyaki chicken and beef, caramelized to perfection, and piled high atop rice and steamed vegetables. For an extra $1.79, we dared them to double our meat, but only after helping ourselves to a free sample.Now, at home, the Royal Gourmet grill challenges me to escape the rigidity of daily menu planning. Armed with a squirt bottle and spatula, I\u2019m riffing. Whether it\u2019s smash burgers, tacos al pastor, or my favorite diner breakfast, the flattop makes it easy for me to just show up, without the pressure of perfection. No timers, no thermometers, just me and my mise en place flowing. When the neighbors curiously poke their heads out, nose first, to smell my teppanyaki, it\u2019s time to throw the glaze on the meat, the sweet and savory lacquer balanced by the comfortable familiarity of cabbage and rice.Now that I\u2019ve left my hometown, the nearest Sarku Japan is about a 30-minute drive, in an unfamiliar mall that raised someone else but still boasts the best summertime air-conditioning this side of the Colorado River. A trip to the mall feels a little sad now. Some things, like low-rise jeans, are better left in the past. But thanks to my Royal Gourmet grill, I can have food court teppanyaki whenever I want. In a way, making Sarku Japan at home strikes the same chord as cooking one of my mother\u2019s Cantonese recipes. It feels like a return to my heritage, a culture shaped by Frappuccinos, soft pretzels, and the Zumiez background music. Mall food court teppanyaki is part of who I am, and my backyard plancha is my homecoming.Royal Gourmet Flattop Grill$95 at Home Depot$139 at AmazonExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendShoppingRecipes you want to make.
