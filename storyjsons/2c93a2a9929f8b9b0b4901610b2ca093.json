Plates and bowls are shingled in their designated spaces along the back, frying pans line up in the middle, glasses and mugs hang securely off the side, and sharp knives stay handle-side up in wooden slots. And even with all of that, there\u2019s still room for items like a mandoline, clean leftover storage containers, and a cutting board without hitting capacity.For most of my adult life, I had the standard, cheap plastic dish drying rack that I had to replace at least once a year because it got mildewy, moldy, or cracked in half. Then a few years ago, I decided to splurge on the simplehuman dish rack I eyed at Bed Bath & Beyond at least six times before committing. It was stainless steel and shining in the aisle, and since I hand wash all of my dishes (dishwashers are unicorns in budget-friendly New York City apartments) I needed space to dry them all. I bought the $80 dish rack with a 20 percent off coupon, registered it for its five-year warranty, and have zero regrets.But even if you have a dishwasher, I highly recommend getting this larger rack (19.8\"W x 17.7\"L x 13.3\"H), because you\u2019ll inevitably have to hand-wash things like your Dutch oven, fragile ceramics, and wine glasses. It\u2019s literally thought of everything: The drip tray is expandable and can slide to the left or the right of the rack. There's a swivel spout that looks like a water slide so you can aim residual water right into the sink (you can put the rack on either side of the sink this way). The wine glass rack can hang even XXL wine glasses upside down by the base of the stem. Oh, and there\u2019s an anti-residue coating on the plastic tray so water spreads and dries more quickly, making sure there\u2019s no gnarly build-up or weird smells coming from your rack. To be honest, I haven\u2019t cleaned it in the nearly two years that I\u2019ve owned it... and it looks almost as good as new. I wipe the outside down when I clean, but it has a fingerprint-proof, rust-proof finish so I don\u2019t have to do much.As anyone whose come to my house and casually mentioned the piece now well knows, this is the Cadillac of dish racks. But if you think it\u2019s too big for your kitchen, simplehuman also makes a compact version (11.9\"W x 15\"L x 8.9\"H) that is slightly smaller and $30 cheaper, but I say go big or go home. It\u2019s an investment in the illusion that you have your life together, and impressing people is priceless.Photo by Alex Lau Simplehuman Steel Frame Dish Rack$90 at AmazonExplore Bon App\u00e9titCleaningShoppingGet OrganizedRead MorecultureStop Being Gross and Learn How to Clean Your KitchenBy Jolie KerrcultureIt\u2019s Time to Embrace the Granny CartBy Meryl RothsteinRecipes you want to make.
