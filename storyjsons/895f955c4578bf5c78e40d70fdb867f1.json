If you don't like butternut squash as you find it too sweet, this recipe will totally change your mind. Don't miss out any of the ingredients, as they all play a part in making this great. We've done it a couple of times when we didn't have cilantro to hand, or didn't have an egg, and both times we realized how much they brought to the dishAnonymousNY9/27/2021LOVE this recipe, especially since I'm always looking for new breakfast recipes that include some spice. I used the Cacique pork chorizo so it's a softer consistency but I like how it stayed almost creamy and homogenous mixed with the squash. I also topped with a little avocado and an extra egg for a filling dinner. It keeps and reheats well.Nate GLos Angeles, CA9/27/2019Explore Bon App\u00e9titSpanishEuropeanAmericanButternut SquashSquashVegetableChorizoSausageMeatFallWinterSideSaut\u00e9BreakfastRecipes you want to make.
