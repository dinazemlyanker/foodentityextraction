My doctor first prescribed it when I was a teen, after he diagnosed me with Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome or PCOS, an incurable (but treatable) hormonal condition that affects 10 million women worldwide. Before birth control, I got my period only twice a year, and I spent most of my adult life dealing with tell-tale PCOS symptoms: cystic acne, anxiety, and hirsutism (a fuzzy navel\u2019s not just a drink).Then I found functional nutritionist and women\u2019s hormone expert, Alisa Vitti and her bestselling book, Woman Code. After her own PCOS diagnosis, the John Hopkins University and Institute for Integrative Nutrition grad rejected the idea of pill-as-treatment and spent years researching and developing her Flo Protocol, a five-step plan that covers everything from naturally balancing blood sugar to lowering stress levels for women with period problems. The one step that\u2019s changed my life: Cycle Syncing\u00ae.No, I\u2019m not referring to the questionable phenomenon of women\u2019s menstrual cycles syncing up when they spend a lot of time together. (Although wouldn\u2019t that be cool if that were the answer to all our problems?) This is more of a mind-body connection, where you look to the specific phases of your menstrual cycle to make decisions about everything from food to exercise. It\u2019s a habit shift: Rather than simply reacting to what our hormones are spelling out, we learn to anticipate and support our bodies\u2019 needs based on where we are in our cycles.Now, if you blacked out during that one health class where the four phases of your cycle were outlined, don\u2019t worry\u2014you\u2019re not alone. The very existence of period coaches like Erica Chidi Cohen of LOOM, wildly popular period-tracking apps like Vitti\u2019s Flo Living, and posts about phase-based eating on lifestyle blogs like Lee from America and Camille Styles prove that women are cultivating our own version of the sex ed we never had.The basic premise here is that the concentration of five hormones (estrogen, progesterone, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, and testosterone) changes four times during the course your menstrual cycle. This creates the four phases: follicular, ovulatory, luteal, and menstrual. In Vitti\u2019s protocol, certain food, exercise, and lifestyle habits support your needs during each particular phase.Take premenstrual syndrome, or PMS, for example. Based on every rom-com ever, you\u2019d think that a steady diet of ice cream, wine, and chocolate is the answer to cramps, bloating, and volatile emotions. But, according to Vitti, if you fill your diet with foods rich in B vitamins, calcium, magnesium, and fiber (like millet, sweet potatoes, apples, beef, and cod) in the week leading up to your period, you\u2019ll stave off sugar cravings, mood swings, and fluid retention. You\u2019re essentially biohacking your cycle to feel your absolute best.I started Cycle Syncing\u00ae on my last month of birth control pills. It was a training-wheels situation to get reacquainted with my body after being unfamiliar with its rhythms for so many years. That first month gave me a clear roadmap to navigate post-pill life, which made the transition more manageable. Since then, I\u2019ve kept a journal to study patterns in how I feel.The most notable adjustment I\u2019ve made is to embrace walks, gentle yoga, or full rest days during my menstrual phase. Old Me would\u2019ve pushed through a high-impact workout, even if it felt like my feet were made of concrete. Now I relish these four days, and don\u2019t feel guilty about skipping the gym. I also initially scoffed at the list of menstrual phase-suggested foods, but note in my journal that I feel \u201cless like garbage than usual \u2026 dare I say, good?\u201d during my period, so all the miso soup with mushrooms and seaweed; wild rice, beet, kale, and adzuki bean salads; and breakfast buckwheat kasha must be doing something right.I\u2019ve learned to save spin class or running for after my menstrual phase, and it\u2019s worth the wait\u2014I actually leave with more energy instead of feeling like I need a three-hour nap after. I also resist the urge to roast everything and instead opt for lighter food preparations like saut\u00e9ing and steaming during this time. I\u2019ve been making things like a green lentil, butter lettuce, carrot, and parsley salad in my follicular phase and a red lentil coconut curry with chard and quinoa in my ovulatory phase. I also eat my weight in out-of-season raspberries and strawberries, and make a note in my journal that I can\u2019t wait for summer.Surprisingly, I\u2019ve learned it\u2019s possible to have a favorite phase of your cycle (who knew?). Mine is the luteal phase. It\u2019s the time of the month where I\u2019m encouraged to indulge my homebody tendencies and focus on self-care and nesting. It gives me the agency to say \u201cno\u201d to various social engagements and stay home for more important things like cleaning my kitchen or starting a whole new skincare routine. And it doesn\u2019t hurt that this phase features all my favorite foods\u2014brown rice, chickpeas, cauliflower, cabbage, and winter squash.I\u2019m now in my third month of Cycle Syncing\u00ae, and while I\u2019m still managing some anxiety and excess hair (I may or may not have a waxer on speed-dial), my skin is clear and I have managed to bring a regular period back.I plan to stick with this phase-based lifestyle because the most appealing and encouraging part of it is that it\u2019s a practice; it\u2019s forgiving and flexible. \u201cIt\u2019s not like a diet that we have experienced before as women, like \u2018This is right and this is wrong,\u2019\u201d says Vitti. \u201cThe idea is that you\u2019re supposed to use it as a guideline to get into a relationship with your body and figure out what really makes you feel your best.\u201dAnd any eating plan that encourages me to eat avocados (to improve ovulation in the follicular phase) and complex carbohydrates (to help with mood swings in the luteal phase) is one I\u2019ll happily stick with long-term.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishSelf CareessayRead MoreLifestyle5 Ways a Menstrual Coach Could Help You Have Better PeriodsBy Aliza AbarbanelRecipes you want to make.
