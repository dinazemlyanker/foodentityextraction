It\u2019s a haven for entertaining friends and hosting family, a place to feed her children, and a full-on test kitchen when developing new recipes for her blog, Women of Today.Ashley Burns PhotographyWhile she\u2019s currently got a large island designed for cooking, chopping, prepping, lounging, and laughing, she wants more from her dream kitchen\u2014a personal touch to reflect her global sense of style. Interior designer Alexa Hampton is, thankfully, no stranger to the art of elevated, eclectic design. She teamed up with Michelin three-starred chef Christopher Kostow to design a space that married fashion and function. Using the Samsung Chef Collection, appliances that have been carefully crafted to complement any home, she could outfit Camila\u2019s kitchen in styles that incorporate chef-inspired features for home cooks\u2014and without sacrificing design.Concept and Rendering by Alexa Hampton and the office of Mark Hampton LLC. Explore the appliances used.\u201cThe goal was to make it family friendly and fun, but chic, too,\u201d says Hampton, who said Camila was very involved with the design of her kitchen. \u201cShe envisioned beams in the ceiling, bright colors and terracotta floors, Moroccan tile, and the stove in the island.\u201dAlexa integrated a variety of materials, including wood, marble, and butcher blocks. As a world traveler, Camila is fond of picking up vintage pieces along the way. Alexa seamlessly folded these pieces into the design for an added personal touch.To satisfy Camila\u2019s color craving, she imagined bright green cabinets to contrast with the earthiness of the terracotta. \u201cColor can be difficult, because there\u2019s a lot going on,\u201d says Alexa, \u201cbut kitchens today allow for that sort of creativity. She made certain the space was designed with plenty of natural light and six barstools to accommodate all the hungry onlookers who might keep Camila company in the kitchen.Concept and Rendering by Alexa Hampton and the office of Mark Hampton LLCFurniture aside, Camila had some requests on the appliances, too. For one, she wanted refrigerators with saloon doors. With all the cooking that goes on in her kitchen, Alexa designed the space so that two could be situated next to one another. With the Samsung Chef Collection 4-Door Flex Built-In Refrigerator, Camila can use the FlexZone\u2122 feature, which switches from freezer to refrigerator depending on your needs. Between her children, her family, her blog, and the occasional party, cold, flexible storage is an absolute necessity.Camila\u2019s culinary lifestyle also calls for two wall ovens. The Samsung Chef Collection Double Wall Oven not only lets Camila utilize each oven with its own set of controls, but also uses Samsung technology to make every meal as stress-free as possible. It\u2019s even got Wi-Fi, so she can control her oven from her phone, from anywhere in the house.With smart appliances that help her balance life\u2019s daily culinary demands and a gorgeous layout that marries style and function, Alexa delivers on a dream kitchen that seamlessly integrates the latest innovations with all the space and style Camila dreams of.Explore Bon App\u00e9titSamsungRecipes you want to make.
