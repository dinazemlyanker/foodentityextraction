Swap in another fatty fish\u2014like mahi-mahi or salmon\u2014and whatever crunchy vegetables (like green beans or snap peas) and small white beans (like navy or Great Northern) you have on hand. Serve alongside orzo, Israeli couscous, bulgur, or crusty bread for sopping up the lemony juices.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

I made it as written except that I had salmon in the house and was too lazy to go to the store for swordfish. I will definitely make it again\u2026and again\u2026DELISH!Guilford, CT2/24/2022Just made it.  Used fresh dill.  It was absolutely WONDERFUL.  Used swordfish, followed instructions to the \"T.\"  Will be making this for guests soon.  The lemon is soooo good, makes it fresh and delightful.  Note: we felt the serving size was a bit large.  It basically calls for each guest to eat 1/2 can of beans, which seems to be a bit much.  But who cares?  It was so good, we ate it gladly.AnneCambria, CA2/22/2022I made this using Whiting because it\u2019s what I could afford. The flavors were great, the vinaigrette was necessary to include something acidic. I thought the dish needed added texture since my asparagus wasn\u2019t as crispy and everything else was mushy, so I topped it with garlic roasted bread crumbs. \nWould make again!KateNew York, NY2/20/2022Explore Bon App\u00e9titDinnerWeeknightEasyQuickOne-Pot MealsGluten-FreeNut-FreeDairy-FreeSwordfishFishSeafoodMahi-MahiAsparagusVegetableNavy BeanBeanWhite BeanMainRecipes you want to make.
