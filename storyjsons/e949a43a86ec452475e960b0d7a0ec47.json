This is the dish that will save you, from chef Parnass Savang of Atlanta\u2019s Talat Market. The Thai omelet will start to puff as soon as it hits the hot oil, turning impossibly light with crispy golden brown edges.Ingredients2 Servings1red or green Thai chile, thinly sliced1tsp. distilled white vinegar1tsp. granulated sugar3Tbsp. fish sauce, divided4large eggs4scallions, thinly slicedFreshly ground white pepper\u00bccup vegetable oilCooked jasmine rice and Sriracha (preferably Shark Brand; for serving)PreparationStep 1Mix chile, vinegar, sugar, 2 Tbsp. fish sauce, and 1 Tbsp. water in a small bowl until sugar is dissolved. Set sauce aside.Step 2Whisk eggs and remaining 1 Tbsp. fish sauce in a small bowl until smooth and frothy. Stir in half of the scallions; season with white pepper. Heat oil in a medium cast-iron or nonstick skillet over medium-high. You want the oil really hot, almost smoking; be careful! Pour egg mixture evenly across skillet. Let cook, undisturbed, until golden brown underneath, about 30 seconds. Carefully turn over with tongs, gently lowering it away from you. Cook until golden brown on other side, about 1 minute. Transfer to paper towels to drain.Step 3Serve khai jiao over rice, topped with remaining scallions, with Sriracha and reserved sauce alongside.How would you rate Khai Jiao?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (6)Back to TopTriangleSo delicious and easy. I have made this a few times now because everyone in my house loves it. Manzie Los Angeles3/7/2022It wasn\u2019t clear what to do with the sauce?  Set it aside and do what with it? Dip? Not impressed.AnonymousBoston2/18/2022Awesome, just like my mom used to make. And the fish-sauce sauce (\u201cprik nam pla\u201d) \u2014 so simple yet so elusive. This version is It. Now I know why mine never tasted right\u2014just tossing chopped chilies into fish sauce ain\u2019t it! Jen NYC, NY8/16/2021Came home from a long day of birding and remembered seeing this recipe on Instagram. Had all the ingredients and easily put everything together for a satisfying dinner. I love the dressing and use it now on salads, rice, veggies, etc.AngieAIndiana4/11/2021I LOVED this dish.  It hits all the right spots: salty, mildly sweet, spicy!  Light and easy.  Yummy.  Great cold too IMHO.  Will be making this often.  I used what I had on hand - red pepper flakes instead of thai peppers and rice vinegar instead of distilled white.  AnonymousLos Angeles10/5/2020My chinese mom has been making this for years (minus vinegar), very standard asian style omelette, great comfort food, quick, cheap, and good way to add protein to your diet.Anonymous9/26/2020Explore Bon App\u00e9titThaiSoutheast AsianAsianEggEasyQuickWeeknight MealsMainNut-FreeDairy-FreeGluten-FreeLunchDinnerRecipes you want to make.
