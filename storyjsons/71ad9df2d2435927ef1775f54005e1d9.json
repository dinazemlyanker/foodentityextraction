To drink, try something from their concise but discerning wine list or ask for a spritz.THE VIBE IS: intimate and gracious. The staff moves efficiently through the small area, delivering plates of refined Italian comfort food. Families line up early for celebratory dinners, and there are usually at least a few well-behaved children slurping back noodles or peeking into the kitchen: The morning\u2019s labors\u2014flour-dusted spaghetti nests and rows of fat ravioli\u2014are usually visible through the pass.PRACTICAL STUFF: Open: Tuesday to Friday, from 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. and Tuesday to Thursday, 5:30 p.m. to 10 p.m.; Friday and Saturday, from 5:30 p.m. to 11 p.m.; and Sundays, from 5:30 p.m. to 9:30 p.m. On the weekends, there\u2019s brunch, from 9:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. Closed Monday.
