A column from Rachel Karten and Emily Schultz, BA\u2019s social media team, dedicated to all the weird things we see while scrolling, double-tapping, and retweeting.There are a lot of things you\u2019ll learn about editor in chief Adam Rapoport from spending five minutes with him. He\u2019s very particular about his vodka soda, he* will *critique your scrambled eggs, and he\u2019s obsessed with golf. Whether Adam is swinging a club through our office (and yes he did almost break a glass door today, thanks for checking in) or gabbing about Jack Nicklaus like they go waaaaay back, he\u2019s basically always trying to insert golf into this food magazine. Well today is his lucky day, because the Masters Club Dinner menu was announced. For the uninitiated (uninterested?), the dinner kicks off the first tournament of the year, and officially jump-starts golf season. All living winners of The Masters are invited to the event (\u201dIt\u2019s kind of like the Supreme Court\u2014once you\u2019re in, you\u2019re in; but instead of black robes, it\u2019s green blazers,\u201d Adam says), and the previous year\u2019s tournament winner gets to curate the menu. Last year, 28-year-old Texas native Patrick Reed (\u201ca very controversial player,\u201d Adam notes) got the honor, and with his dinner, decided to take vengeance on the league\u2019s lactose intolerant. These are Adam\u2019s reflections on this dairy-filled dinner.Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.The Salad Course: Can you call it a salad course when both options are doused in rich, creamy dressing? One option is a classic caesar: romaine, croutons, Parmesan cheese, and a traditional caesar dressing. Okay!? The other option is a wedge salad, with iceberg, red and green onions, tomatoes, bacon, and a buttermilk vinaigrette. Based on the rest of the menu it\u2019s safe to assume there will be a hefty pour of vinaigrette.The Centerpiece: Or as I\u2019ll call it, \u201cThe Texan Powermove.\u201d Of course it\u2019s a ribeye, and of course it\u2019s a cowboy ribeye, which just means there\u2019s a huge, tough bone that runs down the entire piece of juicy meat thrown on an XL plate. It\u2019s slathered with herb butter, so that\u2019s the second course with lots of lactose in it\u2014in case you\u2019re keeping score. For the people who want lighter fare, may Patrick suggest the mountain trout? A lot of golf players are fly fishers in their downtime; maybe Patrick has a sweet side to him after all? I predict Mark O\u2019Meara and Fred Couples will go with this heart-healthy option.The Sides: So sorry for vegans and the dairy sensitive, but I can no longer save you. Here\u2019s what The Masters Dinner can offer you instead: Macaroni and Cheese with white cheddar and smoked gouda. (What are the chances that elbow macaroni is the noodle of choice here?) Creamed spinach with smoked garlic, artichoke hearts, and sweet cream. Corn cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e with turbinado sugar on top. (I\u2019m baffled that this is not a dessert.) And finally, steamed broccoli. Oh sweet relief! A healthyish vegetable! I\u2019ll go with that one, please. Oh wait, the fine print: It\u2019s covered in sea salt and shaved Parmesan.The face of a man who absolutely loves dairy.\nPhoto by Andrew Redington/Getty ImagesThe Dessert: You\u2019re drowning and I get that. Good luck. Here are your choices. 1) Tiramisu, which has mascarpone and whipped cream. 2) Vanilla bean cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e. Does this man just enjoy a blow torch? Or does he just like inflicting pain on those who cannot consume dairy products? 3) Chocolate crunch and praline cheesecake. Maybe that praline is an ode to his home state of Texas, which would be cool. But couldn\u2019t you have gone with a pecan pie or a chocolate praline cookie? Did it have to be a cheesecake?The Wine: 2016 Chateau Montelena, Napa Valley, Chardonnay. The least shocking thing on this menu? A California Chardonnay. There\u2019s also a 2013 Caymus Vineyards, 41st Anniversary, Napa Valley, Cabernet Sauvignon. Are you even at The Masters if there\u2019s no cab sauv?Not Offered: Why are there no potatoes on this menu? Although if you think about it, they would probably be scalloped or in the form of a cheesy gratin.As much as I love creamy things, I also love balance. I would absolutely be out of commission for the next two days.For the par-3 tournament, don\u2019t bet on Patrick Reed. Or at least slip a few Lactaids in his pocket.Recipes you want to make.
