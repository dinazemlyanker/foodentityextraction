Funny how times change.Over the next 25 years, the house became a quick escape from New York City, where I moved after graduating; a permanent home for my parents when they relocated to East Chatham in 2007; and the place where I learned to love to grill.While up there on weekends, we\u2019d spend our days doing this and that\u2014tooling around nearby Hudson, running errands, maybe some yard work. But basically it was all just killing time until I could ask, \u201cWhen should I start the grill?\u201d Which, in the Rapoport house, was interpreted by those not ripping open a bag of charcoal as, \u201cWhen\u2019s cocktail hour?\u201dAt the agreed-upon time, my mom would pull a little orange wooden table from the porch to the patio. I\u2019d fill a metal cooler with ice and a 12-pack. Snacks would be brought out: guacamole when we had time, those little sesame sticks when we didn\u2019t. My brother and mom would pour themselves a Dewar\u2019s on the rocks; my dad, never a big drinker, would often ask, \u201cMaxine, what\u2019s that drink I like again?\u201d \u201cCampari and soda, Dan.\u201d When my wife, Simone, came on the scene, she\u2019d reach for the citrus reamer and mix margaritas for herself and my sister.The best pre-dinner snack.\nPhoto by Alex LauThe backdrop was a mellowing sun over the Berkshires and that intoxicating smell of a charcoal grill just getting going, when it\u2019s all smoke and no fire.I realize it\u2019s at about this point in my letter that I\u2019m supposed to talk about food. And sure, there were skirt steaks charred over a raging fire until dark and crispy; butterflied leg of lamb laced with garlic and rosemary; and racks of dry-rubbed ribs, brought to fall-apart tenderness in a low oven, then shellacked and crisped up on the Weber.But it was always that window before I threw anything on the grate that made me happiest. That moment when we\u2019d gather by the grill like it was some grown-up campfire and just kick back and talk and drink and snack. If we played it right, we\u2019d get about 45 choice minutes just as the sun was turning the sky into what looked like one big Italian ice.Eventually, the sun set.Start the season with Grilled Strip Steak with Blistered Tomatoes and Green Beans.\nPhoto by Alex Lau, food styling by Rebecca Jurkevich, prop styling by Amy WilsonIn 2011 my father fell ill, and he fought the good fight. As is often the case with cancer, there were days and months when things looked good, like he might turn the corner.But I still remember one evening, sky aglow, plumes of smoke rising from the grill, cocktails poured, when my dad never came down to join us. I tried to pass it off as, well, maybe he\u2019s just resting up for dinner. But in the back of my head, I knew better. You didn\u2019t miss cocktail hour at the Rapoport house. That was our time.My dad passed away in April 2012, and a year or so later, my mom sold the house. A few years ago Simone and I got a little cabin out on the North Fork of Long Island. The view\u2019s different, though no less mesmerizing\u2014the cascading sun electrifies the sky as it sinks into the Long Island Sound. While I keep telling myself that one day I\u2019m going to build one of those dream outdoor kitchens with the smoker and the beverage fridge and all that, for now we\u2019re making do with a simple kettle grill, just like we had upstate. And I still time my day toward nailing that 45-minute window\u2014when I\u2019ve got my drink in hand, the charcoal going, the skirt steak marinating, and some sort of crudite\u0301s set out on a wobbly little side table.I guess you could say that things haven\u2019t changed, but that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re the same.And now if you feel like grilling, right this way...1 / 38ChevronChevronSoy Sauce\u2013Marinated Grilled Flank Steak and ScallionsView RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titGrillSummerLetter From The EditorRecipes you want to make.
