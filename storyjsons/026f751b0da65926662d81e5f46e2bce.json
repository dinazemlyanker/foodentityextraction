When something\u2019s so easy to make that you don\u2019t even need one. Welcome to It\u2019s That Simple, a column where we talk you through the process of making the dishes and drinks we can make with our eyes closed.I made it through all of pastry school without admitting my dark truth: I don\u2019t like chocolate. But there is an exception to every rule. Mine? Chocolate paired with peanut butter. I used to satisfy my cravings through impulse purchases of holiday-themed Reese\u2019s Cups. For the record, Reese\u2019s Easter Eggs have my favorite peanut butter to chocolate ratio (read: a very high ratio). But that was before I came across buckeyes.Sweet, salty, crumbly-yet-smooth peanut butter balls dipped in dark chocolate, buckeyes are the retro no-bake confections that taste like peanut butter cups and look like seminude chocolate truffles. Dress \u2019em up, dress \u2019em down, they\u2019re better than Reese\u2019s and require no baking or special pastry skills.The buckeye candy originated in Ohio (a.k.a. the Buckeye State). According to legend, sometime in the 1960s, Ohio resident Gail Tabor invented buckeyes while trying to dip peanut butter balls in chocolate. She noticed that her partially dipped confections looked just like buckeye nuts, which are shed by Ohio\u2019s state tree and resemble chestnuts: dark and shiny dark brown, with a lighter brown top. Tabor brought her buckeyes to Ohio State\u2013Michigan football games for years to great acclaim. The recipe eventually got out, much to Tabor\u2019s dismay, and now we can all enjoy these tasty treats.To make a simple batch of buckeyes, get your set up in place. You\u2019ll need wooden skewers and a cooling rack set in a rimmed baking sheet that\u2019s lined with parchment paper (this will catch the chocolate drippings).Mix together 2\u00bd cups powdered sugar, \u00bd cup plus 1 Tbsp. peanut butter (not natural, which has a higher oil content and can separate), 5 Tbsp. melted unsalted butter, 1 tsp. pure vanilla extract, and \u00bd tsp. kosher salt. The final texture will be a little crumbly but hold together when squeezed.Scoop a tablespoon of the peanut butter dough into your hand. Squeeze or roll the dough between your palms to form a 1\" ball. Repeat. They don't have to be perfect. Cover the peanut butter balls and chill for at least one hour, or overnight.After the peanut butter balls have fully chilled, melt around 8 oz. chopped dark chocolate (between 58% to 70% cacao) in a small bowl until smooth, stirring frequently. You want to use real semisweet chocolate and not chocolate chips. Chocolate chips contain emulsifiers and will not harden properly.Buckeyes dipped in plain melted chocolate and simply left to harden taste great. Ever the pastry chef, however, I like to glow up traditional buckeyes by tempering the dark chocolate. This process will make your chocolate extra glossy, with a satisfying \u201csnap\u201d when you bite into it. You can easily temper dark chocolate in the microwave: Melt \u2154 of the chopped dark chocolate (here, that\u2019s about 5\u2153 ounces) to 114\u00b0F to 118\u00b0F on an instant-read thermometer. Then \u201cseed\u201d the melted chocolate with the reserved \u2153 chopped unmelted chocolate, a small handful at a time, stirring constantly until all the chocolate is melted and the temperature reaches 88\u00b0F to 89\u00b0F.Whether you temper the melted chocolate or not, skewer the top of each peanut butter ball and dip it most of the way into the chocolate, leaving the top exposed.Let the excess chocolate drip back into the bowl for a couple seconds, then transfer the buckeye to the cooling rack to drain. If you like, decorate the buckeyes after you dip them in chocolate and before they harden on the cooling rack. I garnish the dipped buckeyes with flaky sea salt, like Maldon, or decorative nonpareil sprinkles or sugars.Repeat, then let the buckeyes rest on the rack at room temperature until the chocolate fully hardens, about five minutes. Remove skewers and smudge over the holes with your finger to smooth the tops. Serve your buckeyes chilled or at room temperature.This recipe calls for more chocolate than you\u2019ll probably use because you need enough to dip all of the buckeyes. Pour the leftover melted chocolate onto a clean sheet of parchment to harden, then simply peel it off, break into pieces, and store for another use. This is much easier than having to chip away a block of chocolate that\u2019s hardened in the bowl.I\u2019m a non-Ohioan, non-chocolate lover not ashamed to admit I\u2019m in love with buckeyes. And that means there\u2019s a pretty good chance you will be too.Lisa Ruland is a recipe developer, pastry chef, and food writer living in Washington, D.C., and Brooklyn.Explore Bon App\u00e9titIt's That SimpleChocolatePeanut ButterValentines DayRecipes you want to make.
