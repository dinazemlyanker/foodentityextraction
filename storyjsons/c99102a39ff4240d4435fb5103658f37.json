It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.Order the CosmoContributor Amiel Stanek, wearing a cutoff tie dye sweatshirt and wide brim straw hat (pause to picture it), sat next to me at the bar at The Odeon and ordered a martini. But didn\u2019t he know, I asked, about the restaurant\u2019s role in making the Cosmo a modern icon? I learned this in Priya Krishna\u2019s oral history of the Cosmopolitan in Punch, a fun read that will, for the first time in a decade, make you crave the pink drink. At the Odeon in ~1988, Toby Cecchini came up with a Cosmopolitan with Absolut Citron, Cointreau, cranberry juice, and fresh lime juice. The bartender told us that it\u2019s a consistent, popular order\u2014they shake around 15-20 a night. Amiel reminisced about how his dad loved Cosmos so much he used to keep a pitcher of them in the fridge for the better part of the \u201990s. But the more you talk about it the more you want to drink one. So we shared a Cosmo as friends should on a Monday night. It was a creamy, cloudy pink, sweet but tart like a Pixie Stick, utterly delicious. We compared it to sorbet; a nice meal-ender. \u201cVodka is just soooo...anonymous,\u201d said Amiel, again, and I can\u2019t emphasize this enough\u2014wearing a self-tie-dyed self-cropped Champion sweatshirt. No need to order a Cosmo ironically, people, but just order it. This weekend. And be happy.Or make one! Here\u2019s a recipe.Want this letter before it hits the website? Sign up for our newsletter!Ring ringSpeaking of modern icons and Cosmos, I talked to Sarah Jessica Parker this week about her new wine with New Zealand brand Invivo. It\u2019s called SJP and has a blue paint-slashed X on the label\u2014a Sauvignon Blanc that\u2019s \u201cnimble, surprising, and deeply satisfying\u201d she said, followed by a honey-lacquered laugh. It retails for $20.\u201cI was really nervous when the first bottles came in,\u201d she said, \u201cit reminded me of when scripts came in for Sex and the City, I couldn\u2019t wait to read them and I didn\u2019t want to read it. I wanted to know what was in store, what the future held, but I\u2019d be worried I\u2019d be upset, that it would let me down in some way. So I put off drinking the wine for a few days\u2026\u201d But she had a trusted, snobby (her words!) friend come over on a hot summer\u2019s day, poured him a chilled, condensating glass of SJP, and when he said, \u201cOh, sweetie,\u201d she knew it was a victory. \u201cA-ha!\u201d she cheered on the line. I asked her what she felt was a proper pour of wine*, but it turns out her glasses are nearly thimble-sized and not wine glasses at all. \u201cWe have short bistro glasses, 2-3 ounces, that I buy in hardware stores in Europe,\u201d she said. Like these Duralex glasses that guess who, AMIEL STANEK**, also drinks wine out of. \u201cI also drink out of old jam jars, I\u2019m not kidding,\u201d she added. \u201cNot huge Hellmann\u2019s mayonnaise jars, but old Grey Poupon jars, short European yogurt jars\u2026\u201d Devastatingly chic! SJP suggests pairing SJP with spicy Szechuan chicken; it can stand up to the heat without competing with it. I paired it with a bath, where it stood up to the heat just fine. The first sip was big, round green apple Jolly Rancher, and the rest was history.*The proper pour, according to me, leaves just enough room at the top of the glass for my nose, around 1.5 inches.**If you\u2019re thinking, Is Amiel the Carrie Bradshaw of Bon App\u00e9tit? All signs are pointing to YES. Sorry, Andy!HahaBut seriously...here\u2019s the salad recipe.It\u2019s so good, please read\u201cTonight I am going to the restaurant, where I will eat a killed and burned-up bird and drink liquefied old purple grapes, and also I will swallow clear water that used to have bugs and poop and poison in it\u2026\u201dMichael Graydon + Nikole HerriottI\u2019m BabyDid you see our Hot Ten list drop this week? I\u2019m biased towards the wonderful Ochre Bakery in Detroit, a city I visit family in frequently. Get the espresso shortbread! Make the pistachio cake! When Emma Fishman went to Ochre to produce the photoshoot for the magazine, Michael Graydon and Nikole Herriott snapped chef Jess Hicks and Daisuke Hughes\u2019s baby Yuka, who was hanging out in a very large pot. It\u2019s impossible not to melt when you see it. Yuka chomped on bread and fennel while her parents prepped for service. Emma said: \u201dShe was just chillin\u2019 out.\u201d Any other funny details in the bakery? \u201cNo, I was too stressed out.\u201d Sounds like somebody could use some big ol\u2019 pot time.Recipe comment of the weekGet the conky doodle recipe: Amiel\u2019s (of course) ridiculous All-American Cheeseburger PastaUnnecessary food meme of the weekUnnecessary food feud of the weekPhoto by Chelsie Craig, Food Styling by Yekaterina BoytsovaOn Basically this week, a noodle kugel recipe appeared. As creator Sarah Jampel describes, it\u2019s \u201cjust slightly sweet. Just slightly eggy. Definitely not diet food. Lots of surface area for crispy noodles. Curdy in the best sense of the word (from cottage cheese). Buttery. Balanced between airy (like a souffl\u00e9) and custardy (like a pudding).\u201d Months in the making, it was a heated topic in the Test Kitchen as every editor in every department voiced their preference. Carey Polis believes that kugel needs to be either sweet or savory\u2014not both. Emily Schultz is team savory, and when the (slightly sweet!) recipe published, her dad called, asking in outrage, \u201cWhy is there sugar in this? Didn\u2019t you make Mom Mom\u2019s kugel for the Test Kitchen?\u201d She did NOT. (Schultz added: \u201cHe also pronounces it \u201ckegel\u201d like the exercise, but we don\u2019t need to include that.\u201d In fact, we do.) Adam Rapoport will not allow raisins in kugel, but Molly Baz doesn\u2019t mind them (they were left out of Jampelini\u2019s recipe). Emma Wartzman prefers to eat it leftover, at room temp. Brad Leone, who was caught noodlin\u2019 with Matty Matheson this week, commented: \u201cNever really liked kugel\u201d when the recipe appeared on Instagram, racking up 423 likes from fellow haters.
