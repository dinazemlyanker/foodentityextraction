Each week BA\u2019s editorial director, Amanda Shapiro, asks a serious or not-so-serious food question: What\u2019s the best way to grill chicken? Can meal prep be less terrible? Are air fryers worth the hype? In search of answers or at least a spirited debate, she\u2019ll bring in staffers, chefs, writers, and experts from across the culinary universe. Expect strong opinions, tons of recipe inspiration, and more food puns than we'd like to admit.Episodes air every Thursday.
