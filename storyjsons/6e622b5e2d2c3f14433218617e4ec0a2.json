If you can find it, cilantro sold with its hairy white roots still attached will add tons of herbaceous flavor to the super savory marinade. If you have access to a Korean market, you can usually find beautifully marbled pork shoulder steaks already cut into the ideal thickness, which makes this dish even simpler to prepare. The lime- and fish sauce-spiked pepper relish is a milder and streamlined take on nam phrik num, a spicy Northern Thai staple meant to showcase green peppers and chiles. Warm Khao Niao (Thai sticky rice) on the side is a must. Serve this alongside the rest of Leela\u2019s summer menu with Cantaloupe with Spicy Bacon-Cashew Crumble, Cucumber, Tomato, and Green Bean Salad, Grilled Scallops with Peach Sweet Chili Sauce, and Lime-Lemongrass Slushies.\u00a0All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

VictoriaChicago 9/25/2021Perfect simmer dish. It was so easy to prepare everything ahead for a dinner party. Was delicious. Didn\u2019t have fish sauce so used tamari and worchisher. Everyone raved. wendy bSouthern California 8/4/2021Not sure what I did wrong here but this came out so so so salty it was almost inedible. Actually I do know what I must have done wrong - I didn\u2019t have oyster sauce so upped the fish sauce (3 crabs) and soy sauce (lighter Kim lan).  So consider yourself warned.  Shoulda-followed-instructionsBrooklyn8/4/2021I would dice the peppers up more but other than that it\u2019s amazing. Kh7/18/2021I would dice the peppers up more for the relish but other than that this was amazing.
