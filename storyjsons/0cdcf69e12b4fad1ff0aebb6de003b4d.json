How? It\u2019s baconier, for one. The mustard vinaigrette turns glossy bacon fat into a shimmering emulsion that tempts you to bathe in it. Plus, there\u2019s crunchy torn fris\u00e9e to liven up the lettuce situation. Loads of peak-season tomatoes. The hardest part is waiting for water to boil for your jammy eggs. Knowing that, why waste your time with anything else?The recipe comes from the weeknight dinner repertoire of senior food editor Claire Saffitz. One second it offers mouthfuls of ripe tomatoes, the next a creamy bite of a perfect 7-minute egg. It combines hints of acidity from the red wine vin and tomatoes with rich bacon fat and avocado. Top it off with big crispy pieces of bacon and supple shreds of rotisserie chicken that you didn\u2019t even have to roast yourself.Learn how to make the jammiest eggs ever here.\nPhoto by Ted CavanaughThis Cobb manages to do it all without asking for anything in return. Tearing the fris\u00e9e (or whatever crunchy lettuce you prefer, like romaine or radicchio) and shredding the chicken is a breeze. Slicing tomatoes and avocados takes less than two minutes. Boiling the eggs? Turn on the stove, set a timer, and ease those babies into the water. (The trick here is to make sure your ice bath is as cold as possible in order to easily peel the shells.) The bacon? Split those strips into a medium skillet and let them go. But hold that fat! Don\u2019t throw the liquid leftovers away. Toss mustard, sugar, and red wine vinegar into the skillet and whisk away. Watch everything come together into a vision in gold.Lay the fris\u00e9e as your base, season with salt and pepper and start layering. Wanna plate like a pro? Scatter each of the ingredients into \u201cartfully haphazard\u201d sections, as Claire would say. Eggs in one corner, bacon in another, chicken on the diagonal. You get the idea. Before you know it, your tomatoes, avocados, and shredded chicken will make the foundations of a Bob Ross-worth masterpiece. Drizzle with the dressing and sprinkle with salt and pepper and behold: a salad so bright and peppy it\u2019ll make you dance. Just don\u2019t knock over your plate when you do.Get the recipe:Chicken Cobb SaladStep one: Crisp bacon. Step two: Turn bacon fat into an addictive warm vinaigrette.
