Most latkes are a lot of potato and a little bit of onion, but these are nearly half blanched leeks. And rather than grate raw potatoes, as you might for other latkes, you boil a single potato before blitzing it in a food processor along with the leeks, creating a finished texture that channels mashed potatoes. In place of egg, almond flour binds the mixture and also adds a touch of flavor you can\u2019t put your finger on. Eat these with your hands (and tzatziki, if you don\u2019t want to keep it vegan), and head here to read about why Zak the Baker wanted to highlight them this year for Hanukkah.IngredientsMakes 8-121large Yukon Gold potato (8\u201312 oz.), scrubbed1Tbsp. plus 1 tsp. Diamond Crystal \tor 2\u00bd tsp. Morton kosher salt, divided; plus more2large leeks (about 1\u00bd lb.), white and pale green parts only, sliced into \u00bd\"-thick rounds\u00bccup almond flour or meal\u00bccup Italian-style breadcrumbs1tsp. ground cuminFreshly ground black pepperVegetable oil (for frying; about 1\u00bc cups)Tzatziki (for serving)PreparationStep 1Preheat oven to 250\u00b0. Place potato and 1 Tbsp. Diamond Crystal or 2 tsp. Morton kosher salt in a medium pot; pour in cold water to cover. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce heat to medium and simmer until potato is fork-tender, 25\u201330 minutes total. Remove potato from pot; let cool slightly.Step 2Meanwhile, return water in pot to a boil. Add leeks and cook until very soft, about 5 minutes. Drain well.Step 3Using your hands, remove skin from potato; discard. Coarsely chop flesh. Transfer to a food processor and add leeks; pulse until chunky and well combined (it shouldn\u2019t be homogeneous and smooth). Transfer mixture to a bowl. Add almond flour, breadcrumbs, cumin, and 1 tsp. Diamond Crystal or \u00bd tsp. Morton kosher salt, season with pepper, and mix well.Step 4Pour oil into a medium heavy skillet, preferably cast iron, to come \u00bc\" up the sides; heat over medium-high. Working in batches of 3 or 4 and using a \u00bc-cup measure, scoop potato mixture into your hands and flatten into thin 3\"-diameter disks. (Mixture may feel soft, but it will hold together.) Fry latkes, reducing heat if browning too quickly, until deep golden brown, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer to a wire rack set inside a rimmed baking sheet; season with salt. Keep warm in oven while you make remaining latkes. Serve with tzatziki.How would you rate Vegan Leek Latkes?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (13)Back to TopTriangleInstead of cumin I used caraway and they tasted fabulous! E ZinsserSouth Africa6/20/2021Sorry, I\u2019m going back to a more traditional recipe (uncooked grated russets and egg). I carefully followed the recipe and ended up with very fragile cakes that left a third of the mix as blackened bits in the pan. No doubt there is some perfect combination of potato starch level, parboiling, moisture content, oil temp, etc that will make a perfect cake. I\u2019m just not willing to cook this a dozen times to hopefully discern this magic formula. Eric WDurham, NC1/30/2021Is there a vegan tzatziki recipe? \nAnonymous1/15/2021I loved the flavor of these latkes.  They stayed together and did not fall apart, as happened to a previous reviewer.  They kind of reminded me of a knish but in the shape of a latke.  I am a big fan of traditional shredded potato and onion latkes but I will definitely add these to my rotation.  Yum!PaulSeattle, WA12/14/2020These were incredible, and so good reheated, too. I used red potatoes, and my second batch I added shallots, the mixture was less soft, but they didn't hold up as well when frying. The flavors are delicious though and will definitely make again.BrendaNew Jersey12/13/2020Delicious! Keep a few things in mind so they don't fall apart. Make sure not to overprocess the potatoes and leeks. Then use an icecream scoop and flatten them in your palm. If too liquid add some more almond flour and/or breadcrumbs.   No more than 4-5 in the pan. Fry them 4 minutes on one side, then flip them. I reheated them after 3 hrs in the air fryer at 360. Well worth the effort.Peter MoorWashington DC 12/12/2020There are two Zachs/Zaks: Zach Stern and Zak Polani. Two different people, two different spellings of the name.Anonymous12/9/2020Wish you included a Print button for recipes.TigerMOMissouri12/9/2020This isn't a review -- it's a comment. You published a photo with the caption \"Zak the Baker a.k.a Zak Stearn\" but I believe his correct last name is Stern (without an a). And to add insult to injury, you said in the text right below the photo caption that his name is ZaCH Polani. Are there two Zaks/Zachs?Marilyn ShortToronto, Canada12/9/2020These were delicious and perfect as written. Be patient and don\u2019t crowd the pan. Shannon StaceyCanton, MI12/9/2020These totally fell apart in the pan and just became a mass of floating potato bits - what did i do wrong?GraceDelaware12/6/2020Can I make this a day in advance then reheat in the oven?  Thanks.taycPortland, OR12/5/2020Everything Zak the Baker makes is delicious. It's so exciting to see him featured with his Latke's in Bon Appetit.
