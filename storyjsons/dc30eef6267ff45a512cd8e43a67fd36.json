It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.Photo by Alex Lau, Food Styling by Yekaterina Boytsova\u00a0A good soup is easy to findI thought about writing a Valentine to Andrea Nguyen\u2019s ridiculously easy canh, a brothy Vietnamese soup that in her version, is full of greens and shrimp. I made it last weekend and it happened so fast I didn\u2019t know what hit me. Stir some onion around, add water and fish sauce, add greens, ginger, and shrimp, done. It\u2019s amazing how much savory goodness the shrimp and fish sauce bring to, well, a pot of water. Afterward, a world of opportunity opened: I could add a sliced serrano next time! (I couldn\u2019t actually think of any more things I\u2019d change, but she has some suggestions in the article too.)Make it: My Favorite Soup is Brothy, Gingery, and Ready in 30 MinutesWant this letter before it hits the website?

Are we using enough of them? Could there be more? (Trick question: There could always be more.) Take your lunch break to swoon over photos of an English farmhouse with approximately 47 sconces. I also love design that has undertones of divorce, debt, and celibacy. And please relax! The black granite countertop is going\u2014soon.Read more: How Restaurateur Keith McNally Built Texture Into His 1919 Cotswolds HomeOverheard at BARapo, trying to convince two staffers wearing jumpsuits to take a photo together for Instagram: \u201cWe\u2019re gonna post a picture that says, \u2018looking for a third.\u2019\u201dHilary Cadigan: \u201cI don\u2019t think that phrase means what you think it means.\u201dBOOM. Oh god. I peeked into the oven window and saw a sweet potato had exploded. Sweet yellow carnage was everywhere and the potato was split open down the middle. I\u2019d poked holes in it with a fork, I swear! The temp was 350! So why did it explode? I\u2019d like to blame my new oven, which has been trouble since the day it was installed. I even had to have it replaced because the first one made actual explosions when ignited. TERRIFYING. But if you know why my sweet p spontaneously burst at the seams, please fill me in.Unnecessary food meme of the weekUnnecessary food feud of the weekA 5-lb bag of BULLS-EYES showed up at the office, spurring a buzz of excitement among those of us who are RIGHTFULLY huge fans of Cow Tales. (Bulls-Eyes caramel creams\u2014around since 1918!\u2014are a chopped-off version of Cow Tales, a soft outer layer of caramel with a white creamy-powdery center.) \u201cAs far as old lady living room dish candy goes, I'll take a Werther\u2019s Original over a Cow Tale any day,\u201d dismissed Aliza Abarbanel, earning nods of agreement from Amanda Shapiro and Rachel Karten. They are \u201cDELICIOUS,\u201d declared Hilary Cadigan, \u201cthe ideal blend of chewy and frosting-y, semi-sweet and very sweet.\u201d \u201cWill someone explain to me why they are called \u2018cow tales\u2019?\u201d asked MacKenzie Fegan, derailing the conversation  into a flurry of confusion. \u201cNever heard of them,\u201d was the refrain from the deprived editors in the Test Kitchen. \u201cIf there are so many seedless oranges, why eat seeded oranges?\u201d asked Adam Rapoport (he\u2019s two weeks late to that feud.) \u201cCow Tales are $0.25 at the counter at Wawa!\u201d announced Emily Schultz, qualifying her as a contestant on The Price Is Right. \u201cThey. Are. Disgusting,\u201d said Meryl Rothstein, refusing to stand down. It\u2019s too bad she\u2019s so wrong.Explore Bon App\u00e9titBeggs NewsletterRead MorecultureIs It Ever Okay...to Fake an Engagement for Free Dessert?By Alex BeggscultureTrader Joe\u2019s Latest Snacks, Reviewed in These Strange, Strange TimesBy Alex BeggscultureA Super Bowl Menu from My Home to YoursBy Alex BeggscultureI Made BA\u2019s Best Banana Bread and It Was Indeed the BestBy Alex BeggsRecipes you want to make.
