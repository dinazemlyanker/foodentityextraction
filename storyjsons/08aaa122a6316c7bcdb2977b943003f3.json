When something's so easy to make that you don't even need one. Welcome to It's That Simple, a column where we talk you through the process of making the dishes and drinks we can make with our eyes closed.As with every great relationship, I\u2019ve come to expect a lot from my plate. Sometimes I want it all\u2014comfort and sustenance, but with a little spark too. That\u2019s when I make korma, the quintessential North Indian gravy that checks every box. Korma defies strict definition, but this Mughlai dish typically involves meat or vegetables braised in a relatively mild velvety yogurt sauce that\u2019s seasoned with aromatic spices. It often carries a nutty undertone from blended almonds, cashews, coconut, or poppy seeds. This sauce tastes good with just about anything\u2014vegetables, paneer, or even just roti to sponge it up (you know, for when you\u2019re in a restaurant and actual plate licking is frowned upon).There was a time when I wouldn\u2019t have dreamt of making my own korma. Without fail, every recipe I came across contained words like \u201cdesiccated almonds\u201d and directed me to blanch, soak, and peel the skins off each nut before grinding them into a smooth paste. Peel each individual almond? How demanding! Inevitably, I\u2019d settle for those microwavable pouches of korma. Quick, yes, but not nearly as satisfying as freshly made.But then I discovered a game changer: nut butter. Instead of prepping and grinding nuts, all you need to do is scoop a few spoonfuls of nut butter into your pot and suddenly, you\u2019ve transformed a generic can of tomatoes into a decadent korma sauce. Okay, so the nuts in nut butter may be dry-roasted and unskinned, which is a little different from traditional korma, but it\u2019s barely noticeable, and did I mention, you\u2019ll have korma in minutes?When making korma, I start by slicing and saut\u00e9ing 1 onion along with 1 Tbsp. each minced garlic and ginger paste. (In my house, bottled garlic and ginger is just fine.) After this pungent trio begins to brown, I build the rest of the korma sauce in the same pot. I stir in \u00bc cup water, 1 small can diced tomatoes (whole tomatoes would also work), 1 Tbsp. madras curry powder (look for one produced in India\u2014I purchase the brand Nirav online\u2014or, for maximum flavor and freshness, make it yourself), and 1 tsp. each garam masala, ground red chile (I like Kashmiri chile powder), and salt.And then, when no one\u2019s looking, I pull out the nut butter. Creamy almond butter will bring you closest to a classic korma, but cashew butter works great too. Try to choose a natural, single-ingredient product where you\u2019re only getting the nuts. Surprisingly, most brands fit the bill. But this korma is forgiving, so if you only find toasted, no-stir almond butter with sea salt, then go for it. (I wouldn't reach for one swirled with maple or chocolate.) I spoon out 2\u20133 Tbsp. nut butter into the pot and give it a good stir. If your nut butter is hard and clumpy\u2014as it tends to be at the bottom of the jar\u2014soften it up in the microwave or with a splash of hot water, or take the time to smash it with the back of a spoon once it\u2019s in your pot, and really mix it into your sauce as it all starts to cook together. Otherwise, someone\u2019s gonna bite into a glob\u2014it isn\u2019t the end of the world but it will give away your secret! If you like a smooth restaurant-texture, now\u2019s the time to break out that immersion blender and give it a few whirls in your pot. And that\u2019s it\u2014that\u2019s the sauce!After the sauce has cooked for five minutes, gently fold in the main ingredient of your choice and simmer until everything is cooked through. My favorite version is vegetarian \u201cchicken\u201d korma, made with frozen meatless-chicken strips, but you can swap in almost anything: Crisped-up paneer or tofu works great, or you can make a variation of navratan korma by adding in your favorite combination of vegetables, like parboiled potatoes, peas, cauliflower, broccoli, mushrooms, carrots, or even frozen mixed vegetables. Really anything you like in a creamy curry will taste great. For the unifying finale, turn off the heat and stir in 3\u20134 tablespoons of coconut cream, heavy cream, or yogurt, to taste.The nut butter may go undetected, but it is the subtle star of this dish. You may never go back to ready-to-eat packets of korma again and, at the very least, you\u2019ll enjoy a much-needed break. As every nut butter fanatic will tell you, a little separation is natural.Varu Chilakamarri is a writer and attorney who loves creating easy recipes influenced by the cooking of her Indian immigrant parents.
