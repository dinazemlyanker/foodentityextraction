But almost as soon as the cracked black pepper, fresh from a mill the size of a baseball bat, hit the chartreuse olive oil, the bread was gone, torn to bits by grabby preteen hands.And then Jessica would bring another gleaming loaf. And another. It was the size of what I now know to be an iPad\u2014enough for four people to demolish in minutes or for one person to slowly winnow away throughout the course of the meal. It was plentiful and fresh and free and the servers never grumbled about bringing more (or if they did, we never noticed, our vision clouded by carbs).I haven\u2019t been to the Macaroni Grill in Timonium, a Baltimore suburb that, yes, sounds like a chemical element, since the celebration lunch after my fifth-grade graduation\u2014which also happened to be my last social event with the cool girls before we headed to middle school, where I failed to maintain my social standing. But I still think of that bread fondly and, thanks to the internet, the world\u2019s great connector, I know I am not alone.When you're here you're... oh wait, wrong chain of Italian-American restaurants.\nPhoto by Lisa DiederichThe Macaroni Grill\u2019s rosemary peasant bread has made all of the internet's prestigious listicles of restaurants with the best free bread (including Buzzfeed\u2019s \u201cdefinitive\u201d one) and inspired copy-cat recipes aplenty.And the company knows its power. Holly Wagstaff-Bellomo, vice president of marketing, told me that when the brand surveyed guests to find out the parts of the dining experience they valued most, \u201cbread was one of the top things that was universally loved.\u201d Macaroni Grill serves 100,000 loaves of its rustic-style rosemary bread per week (that\u2019s over 5 million annually), which arrive parbaked and frozen from a centralized kitchen in order to maintain flavor and consistency. \u201cIt has to be handled in a certain way so that it has that crusty delicious outside but light and airy inside,\u201d Wagstaff-Bellomo explained\u2014not to mention that sending parbaked loaves accounts for variations in altitude across the 88 U.S. locations.We peasant-bread zealots (and, yes, I speak for all of us) don\u2019t just love it because it\u2019s free. But the fact that it\u2019s so delicious makes its costless abundance all the more amazing. Is it wrong that I don\u2019t remember any of the food we paid for? If that were the case, why would they serve free bread at all?Many people smarter than I am\u2014namely Stephen Dubner and Steven Levitt of Freakonomics fame\u2014have pondered this very riddle.On their podcast, the duo address a mountain of common conjectures. First, there\u2019s the dessert theory: Free bread keeps customers from ordering cheap-ish desserts, which means the restaurant can turn the table over to another party faster. Second, the service theory: It staves off hanger and makes the servers\u2019 jobs easier. Third, the drink theory: Salty food encourages customers to order drinks, on which restaurants earn a bigger margin.They then get into the addiction theory (the initial food opens a floodgate, spurring customers to order more); the theory of free fanaticism (we dumb humans simply love free stuff and those who provide it); and the peer-pressure theory (once one restaurant starts serving free bread, they have a competitive edge that drives other restaurants to do the same).Yes, yes, yes. This all made sense. These were the same hypotheses I had found in my very official Google research, scans of user-generated sites like Quora and Reddit, where people pose questions (like on the \u201cNo Stupid Questions\u201d thread) and answer them like fact (\u201cit\u2019s in the law in France,\u201d one person writes. I haven\u2019t been able to verify. Or \u201cit\u2019s a sign of hospitality,\u201d which, no offense, but duh).But actually, in the end, Levitt and Dubner debunked the laundry list of explanations and landed on\u2026historical precedent, the answer to so many of the world\u2019s bizarre quandaries.The first restaurants in the western hemisphere, as the historian Andrew Haley explains to Dubner and Levitt on the podcast, were taverns that served a set menu for a set price at a set time. It was thus in the economic interest of the tavern owners to supply complimentary bread, typically made by a local baker, so that customers would fill up on carbohydrates instead of expensive proteins. This continued to be the case with the subsequent popularity of prix fixe menus and was hard to shake even when the seismic shift to \u00e0 la carte menus in the 20th century made it economically impractical. When, in 1913, New York restaurants moved to introduce a cover charge to finance bread, water, and other free accompaniments, it was met with extreme resistance and incredulity: Patrons started taking their own bread to offending restaurants, which quickly reversed course. Even by this time, the tradition of free bread had become deeply rooted in restaurant culture.Olive oil bottles upcycled into flower vases? It's all happening at Macaroni Grill.\nPhoto by Lisa DiederichA century later we\u2019re still not over it. A quick search of \u201cbest free bread\u201d gives you best-of lists, sure, but also lots of laments: In 2014 ABC News declared that free bread was hitting endangered status. The crisis had not been resolved as recently as 2017, when a New York Post story lamented the glory days of mediocre\u2014but free!\u2014bread.Restaurants that do offer complimentary bread aren\u2019t run by money-squandering dimwits (though, I did learn that Olive Garden\u2019s investors, believing otherwise, tried to put the kibosh on unlimited breadsticks): Customers are generally wary of what economists call \u201cprice partitioning\u201d (X amount of money for a cover, Y amount of money for bread, Z amount of money for coat check), so instead of listing the bread for a fee, restaurateurs fold it into the prices elsewhere.All of which means that the bread\u2019s not actually free at all.I\u2019ve spent years eating highfalutin bread\u2014naturally fermented, made with locally milled heirloom grains, wood-fired, priced at $8 a loaf, sold out by noon, spread with cultured butter. I love everything about it: the open crumb that can hold no jam; the wheaty complexity that makes it resistant to most applications (don\u2019t try French toast); the way it makes me feel holier-than-thou. But I\u2019ve missed the warm fluff of the rosemary peasant bread, so light you could stomach the whole loaf in one sitting\u2014a beach read compared to the Great American Novel. I had to go back to Macaroni Grill, decades later, to taste it again.Because the Timonium location closed since I moved away from home, I dragged my parents and husband an hour south, to the Annapolis branch, which looked comfortingly similar: same faux stucco siding, some faux stone pillars, same mural of\u2026is it Cinque Terre?...on the exterior. But this time we didn\u2019t have to put our names down with the hostess and wait 20 minutes for a pager to light up and buzz when our table was ready. We walked right in. It was 4 p.m. on a Sunday, and there were plenty of booths to choose from. We alerted Kendyll, our truly lovely server, that we\u2019d be having drinks and, as my dad said, \u201capps,\u201d and that we definitely wanted the bread.But would it still be free? A 2018 post on TripAdvisor suggested that the price had been raised to $2 a piece. When I called the location before our trip (because would 60 minutes trapped in the car with my parents even be worth it if we had to pay for bread?), I was told that the bread was free with entr\u00e9es but $1 if we wanted a loaf and nothing else. I got to the bottom of it with VP of marketing Wagstaff-Bellomo, who clarified that \u201cIf you\u2019re in the restaurant, it\u2019s absolutely complimentary.\u201d It\u2019s when you want to buy a bunch of loaves to, say, hoard in your freezer that they charge $1 each.We ordered our drinks\u2014cucumber soda for me, Riesling for my mom, a Negroni (?!) for my husband and, inexplicably, Moscato (?!?!) for my dad\u2014along with crispy fresh mozzarella (\u201cmozz sticks,\u201d as my dad requested) and the signature mac-and-cheese bites. Then, we waited.The bread came out first. It was just as shiny as I recalled but not as large. It was only slightly warmer than room temperature, but even that was enough to distract us, at least for a moment, from its lack of flavor and spongy dryness. It wasn\u2019t as rich or salty or fragrant or crusty as I remembered. It wasn\u2019t as good as what I could make at home. I was disappointed but also not surprised, like looking at old photos of myself from high school prom and realizing that that sky-blue sequined dress wasn\u2019t nearly as cute as I remembered (especially since two of us wore the same one). But with enough olive oil, the bread was passable. We still ate half before our various hot and fatty fried cheese snacks, with their various dipping sauce sidekicks, arrived.It was, after all, free.Sarah Jampel is a contributing editor at Bon App\u00e9tit.Explore Bon App\u00e9titRestaurantsItalian AmericanRed SauceRead MorerestaurantsRed Sauce AmericaBy Bon App\u00e9titRecipes you want to make.
