And get the snacks! We love the shaved ham and cheddar with brown butter, squid ink gnocchi fritti (like big savory beignets) with house-smoked local sturgeon cream, and other appetizer-sized plates listed on the restaurant\u2019s chalkboard menu.THE VIBE IS: lively! Located down the block from sister restaurants Joe Beef and Liverpool House, Vin Papillon inherited that same convivial, neighborhoody vibe.PRACTICAL STUFF: Open Tuesday to Saturday 3 p.m. to midnight. Closed Sunday and Monday. No reservations. During the summer go early and park yourself outside at one of the wooden picnic tables on the back terrace.\u2014Claire SaffitzPhoto by Dominique LafondPhoto by Dominique LafondWE ALSO LOVEJoe BeefAn over-the-top meal unlike any other, in Little BurgundyLo\u00efcAll roads (and great p\u00e9t-nat) lead to this Saint-Henri wine barMon LapinLaid-back vibes and cool natural wines in Little ItalyExplore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
