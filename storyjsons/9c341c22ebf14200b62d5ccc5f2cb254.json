Every Saturday and Sunday, I\u2019d get to my local coffee shop right when it opened (7:30 a.m.) and buy a small black coffee ($2). I\u2019d camp out with an enormous book of Middle English poetry until the caf\u00e9 closed and I had to migrate to the library (sad but true). And every five weeks, when my reward card had been punched ten times, I\u2019d parade in and trade it for a dirty chai iced soy latte, size large ($7.50).Perhaps this was unethical. Perhaps I was just a student trying to watch my budget. Perhaps I can never tell you the name of this coffee shop because I\u2019d never be allowed back.Now that ye olde days of incomprehensible poetry are behind me (I think), I\u2019m less interested in buying fancy drinks and more interested in making something that tastes like it was carefully crafted by a barista but was actually made by yours truly right at home.Like this Iced Horchata Latte from Cofax in L.A., which checks all the boxes. It tastes luxurious and refreshing\u2014like something I\u2019d easily pay an arm and leg for after I\u2019ve sweated through my dress on my morning commute\u2014but I don\u2019t need an espresso machine or a milk frother to make it. All that\u2019s required is the forethought to soak a handful of ingredients I already have in the kitchen\u2014oh, and a coffee grinder and a blender (that\u2019s easy, though: my grinder is practically attached to my person since I love coffee, and my blender is a standby for smooth soups, creamy sauces, and occasional smoothies).Before I go to sleep, I grind up brown rice and coffee beans and soak them, along with half a cinnamon stick and some raw almonds, in plenty of water. The next morning, I blend it all up and pour it through a fine mesh strainer once or twice to get rid of any remaining grit.Thanks to the starchy rice and the fatty almonds, the final product is creamy, nutty, and rich. It\u2019s milky but totally dairy-free, which makes \u201clatte\u201d a bit of a misnomer. This recipe differs from traditional horchata\u2014a category of plant-based drinks ubiquitous throughout Mexico and Latin America, with lots of regional variations\u2014in the addition of coffee beans. But considering I rely on caffeine to guarantee that I\u2019m not a zombie before 10 a.m. and between 3 p.m. and 5 p.m., the coffee is critical.I\u2019ll mix in simple syrup (equal parts sugar and water) since it distributes sweetness more evenly than adding straight sugar, then transfer my drink to an ice-filled mason jar and scamper out the door. Sometimes, if I\u2019m feeling extra exhausted, I\u2019ll mix the horchata with cold brew to make a \u201ccochata.\u201dOne batch of horchata is enough to last me through the week (score!), and I can complete the whole process in the same number of minutes it usually takes the person in front of me at the coffee shop to finish their elaborate order.Get the recipe:Iced Horchata LatteView RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titNever FailSummer DrinksCoffeeRecipes you want to make.
