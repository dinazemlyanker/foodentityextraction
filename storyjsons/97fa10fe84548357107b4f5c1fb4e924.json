If you sign up for our newsletter, you\u2019ll get her letter before everyone else.When I was a kid I took part in a lot of programs that encouraged young students to read more books by, well, bribing us with things like pizza and ice cream. I was (and still am) a big fan of books and food, so afternoons reading turning into evenings with free treats were the best of both worlds for me\u2014and always felt kind of like I was getting away with something.I had the same rush when, for our June\u2013July issue (out now; subscribe to get future issues!), my coworkers green-lit a story featuring seven newish novels that all have a lot to do with food. There\u2019s a beautiful generation-spanning story centering four Dakota women and the seeds that sustain them; romances set against two rival ph\u1edf spots, a charming English B&B, and the dreamy Italian coast; and a murder mystery wherein our protagonist\u2019s ex, a food critic, dies in her aunt\u2019s Filipino family restaurant. All the novels are, I think, ultimately uplifting, and if you\u2019re looking for a summer read (that pairs perfectly with a summer snack), I hope you\u2019ll check them out.Since I didn\u2019t include any children\u2019s books in the print story, I wanted to share a few fun, kid-friendly options for the littles in your life:Ice cream shop Salt & Straw launched a super fun summer pint collection, which is inspired by five books for young readers in partnership with Scholastic.Ahead of the release of Kalamata\u2019s Kitchen, a sweet new book featuring young heroine Kalamata and her reptile pal Al Dente, young open-minded eaters can sign a Taste Bud pledge.And finally, these are the new picture books that have been added to my gifting rotation: Aram Kim\u2019s Sunday Funday in Koreatown, with its gorgeous illustrations of dishes like kimbap and patbingsu; the bright, fun, perfect-for-summer, paleta-filled Paletero Man by Lucky Diaz and Micah Player; and beautiful, moving Watercress by Andrea Wang and Jason Chin.It\u2019s hot here in Brooklyn, and I\u2019m definitely spending more time reading on the sofa and less time in the kitchen. Meaning I\u2019ll only brave my oven for the quick hits: Christina Chaey\u2019s spicy braised tofu, Sarah Jampel\u2019s sheet-pan gnocchi, and contributor Rosalyn Vera\u2019s perfect-for-brunch mollettes, which were a fast favorite in our home. I\u2019d love to hear what low-fuss recipes you\u2019re cooking from the BA archives, and, of course, what you\u2019re reading too.
