There\u2019s nothing small children are better suited for than going to restaurants where they\u2019re expected to stay seated, order unfamiliar food, wait patiently for it to arrive from a backlogged kitchen, and then spend an hour or so eating it while making small talk.Which is why, since we had kids, special occasions when we previously might have gone out for a celebratory group meal are now spent cooking instead. You can make all the noise you want and nobody will hiss-shush you through clenched teeth. You don\u2019t have to surrender your phone so your kids can watch Play-Doh videos in order to be able to converse with the family and friends you came out to see. And you never spend incomprehensible amounts of money for what is too often overcooked eggs and flabby bacon. At home our bacon is always crisp.Ever since we came to our senses, I\u2019ve made Mother\u2019s Day brunch for our extended families. Ostensibly it\u2019s my gift to the mothers, but it\u2019s secretly my gift to me. Being able to relax, let my kids be kids, and make the food that delights me is vastly more enjoyable than hoping my Bellini won\u2019t arrive flat. I often make fruit crisps and crumbles, which I find to be a perfect brunch food, especially when the sugar is kept in check and the oat topping channels granola with olive oil, almonds, and maple syrup. I like to serve it warm or at room temperature with a dollop of yogurt; it\u2019s a huge hit with adults and kids. Leftovers\u2014if they exist\u2014become a weekday breakfast that happens to be delicious cold from the fridge too.Get the recipe:Strawberry-Granola CrispBecause this crisp is barely sweetened, leaning into in-season berries instead of added sugar, it's a perfectly acceptable brunch or breakfast.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titStrawberryCrispMother's DayPicky Eaters\u2019 ClubRead MorecookingA Cheesy, Bready Dinner to Please the Pickiest Eaters in Your HouseholdBy Deb PerelmancookingThis Garlic Bread Is the Secret to Converting Bean HatersBy Deb PerelmancookingNo Picky Eater Wants to Eat Broccoli\u2014Until You Add KetchupBy Deb PerelmancookingThese Spinach Artichoke Melts Are Where Dip Meets Grilled CheeseBy Deb PerelmanRecipes you want to make.
