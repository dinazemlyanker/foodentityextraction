They are easy to throw together, can handle just about whatever ingredients you have in the back of your fridge, and don't require one million pots and pans. That being said, I've only ever explored the ever-popular breakfast frittata category. Well, until I made Chris Morocco's eggplant frittata with cabbage slaw. It's got all of the weeknight-friendly qualities I listed above, but with more dinner flair. Ready to get on the dinner frittata bandwagon? Let's do this.First up, the slaw, made with half the Napa cabbage, cucumber, serrano chile, fresh lime juice, scallions, and salt. You won\u2019t use the slaw until the very end, but you will mindlessly snack on it during the rest of the steps.Next, the eggplant mixture. You\u2019re going to cut the eggplant into 2\u201d sections (crosswise) and then into \u00bd\u201d thick batons. And you're going to look at all the eggplant you cut and think, \u201cThis is way too much!\u201d Don\u2019t worry\u2014it cooks down a lot. Get it all browned and soft on the stove, and add the remaining cabbage, onion, and garlic. Stir around until all the ingredients get very tender. Now, take that unsightly-but-very-delicious mixture off the stove and let it cool.Okay! Egg time! Whisk two eggs and then add ginger, scallion, and tamari (I used soy sauce because I already had it in my fridge). Once the eggplant mixture is cool enough (takes about 10 minutes), add it to the egg mixture\u2014I used my hands to incorporate it.Ready to make the frittata? First, add the egg and eggplant mixture to your oven-proof, non-stick pan, then wait about three minutes while the bottom cooks over medium-high heat on the stove. During these three minutes, you\u2019ll unfortunately realize the next step is to flip the frittata and \u201cinvert back into skillet.\u201d Since I don\u2019t want you to have to do what I did (frantically look up YouTube tutorials on how to flip frittatas), here are two options for you: Option one is to slide the frittata onto a plate (or, even better, a flat pot lid), take your skillet off the stove and place it upside down on the plate (or lid), take a deep breath, and swiftly invert it back into the pan and place the pan back on the burner for another 2 minutes. And if you\u2019re reading this and are like \u201cINVERTING IS NOT FOR ME,\u201d there's option two. Start on the stove for three minutes (as described above) and then pop it in a 350\u00b0F oven until the top is set, around 2-3 minutes. As Robert Frost once said, \"Two roads diverged in a wood and I took the one that made it easier for me to make a frittata, and that has made all the difference.\"Finally, slide your frittata onto a plate and top with the slaw you\u2019ve been snacking on the whole time. Sprinkle some red pepper flakes on the whole thing. Congrats, you're a dinner frittata convert.Get the recipe:Eggplant and Cabbage Dinner FrittataWe love the just-set creamy texture of a stovetop frittata, but it does make it a little scary to handle. if you aren\u2019t sure about inverting it to get it out of the pan, we have your back. Instead of flipping, transfer it to a 350\u00b0 oven to finish cooking through.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishFrittataEggplantNapa CabbageFeel Good Food PlanRead MorecookingThis Roasted Broccoli Recipe Indulges All My Food ObsessionsBy Elaheh NozariRecipes you want to make.
