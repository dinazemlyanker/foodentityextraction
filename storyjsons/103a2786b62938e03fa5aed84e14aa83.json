I had officially become a living, breathing Hollywood trope (think Enchanted meets Insecure), and was absolutely thrilled about it. In my mind, I was constantly dancing down the city streets, singing a tune about how Dreams Really Do Come True\u2122. Life was sweet, and about as perfect as the crullers from Daily Provisions that I\u2019d treat myself to every weekend.The Danny Meyer\u2013helmed caf\u00e9, located just a few blocks away from that first apartment, also doles out shots of espresso, loaves of rye, and chicken milanese, but the real sell is their cruller: a doughnut with a crispy-crunchy shell of spiraling ridges and an impossibly golden, buttery, moist (sorry) middle. And that\u2019s just the original. Other variations on the classic are showered in cinnamon sugar, drizzled with a deep mahogany-hued maple glaze, or, like my favorite that summer, a deep pink strawberry shell. I made it my habit to pair one with a cup of coffee and get to know the city in a sugar-induced high.A lot has changed since that first summer. I\u2019ve moved several times. I\u2019ve transitioned into new jobs. And...I\u2019ve even gotten a bit more cynical about New York too. But when I need a reminder of what\u2019s good in this city, I know I can always return to that cruller. If not everything can be sublime all the time, at least I know those doughnuts will be.Go there: Daily ProvisionsExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendRestaurantsNew YorkRecipes you want to make.
