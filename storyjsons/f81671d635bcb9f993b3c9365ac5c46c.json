Silvio Frlic has seen some things.By Hilary CadiganApril 16, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Alex LauFacebookTwitterEmailWelcome to Red Sauce America, our coast-to-coast celebration of old-school Italian-American restaurants.When he arrived in New York City from Croatia back in 1965, Silvio Frlic was 16 and spoke no English. But he did speak German, Spanish, Italian, Romanian, a little Russian, a little Belarusian, and a little Polish. \u201cOnce you know a few,\u201d he says with a shrug, \u201cit\u2019s easy to learn a few more.\u201d He spent nights going to school and days working in food service\u2014incidentally building a resume that reads like a Rolodex of NYC\u2019s most iconic restaurants: the Friars Club, Caf\u00e9 La Fortuna, the Gaslight Caf\u00e9, Mamma Leone\u2019s. Eventually he settled at Bamonte\u2019s, one of the few institutions that remain from that era, an Italian-American white-tablecloth time capsule dating back to 1900.Things have changed a lot since. The neighborhood, Williamsburg, has morphed into a hipster mecca. The rents have skyrocketed. Most of the original restaurants have closed. Many of their customers have passed away. But Bamonte\u2019s, says Frlic, has changed very little\u2014well, aside from the fact that he no longer presses the juice out of an entire duck carcass tableside. We sat down beside a wall covered in photos of a younger Frlic (a few more teeth, a lot more hair, the same impish grin) and talked about all the things he\u2019s seen and heard (and not seen and not heard) in a half-century waiting tables.So, how did you start working at Bamonte\u2019s?I didn\u2019t really want to come. It was summer\u2014a beautiful day. I wanted to go to the beach! But my cousin Mario was working here so he called me. It was 1977 or \u201978, during the Giglio Feast, a big Italian festival they have in Williamsburg every July, and they didn\u2019t have no help. After that I kept coming back. We never have a slow night, except the Super Bowl and when the Yankees are in the World Series. I\u2019ve been here 41 years. But cousin Mario\u2019s been here 42, so he beats me.What was the first day like?Oh, I was used to it. I worked at a lot of restaurants before Bamonte\u2019s: At Danny\u2019s Hide-A-Way, I started as a pot washer\u2014the worst thing in the world\u2014and worked my way up to second chef. Then Friars Club, Caf\u00e9 La Fortuna, the Gaslight Caf\u00e9, Amalfi. All of them are closed now. I worked at Mamma Leone\u2019s too. Dish carrier. First day I went inside, I got lost. It was gigantic! I didn\u2019t know how to get out of the place. They used to serve thousands of people a night. Hundreds of waiters. The kitchen was one block long.What made you switch from the kitchen to front of house?My hair.Your\u2026hair?My hair started to fall off. And the chef told me, \u201cIf you stay any longer in the kitchen, you\u2019re not gonna have hair.\u201d I was 20 years old. I says, \u201cGod. Let me get outta here.\u201d In those days, if you don\u2019t have no hair, you don\u2019t have no dates. Today, it\u2019s different.Now you can get dates without hair?Oh, yeah. Now it\u2019s no problem.What was it like being a waiter in those days?Everything was done in front of you. All the salads, pastas, whole fish, even\u2014we\u2019d fillet it at the table. Cherries jubilee, crepes suzette. My favorite was duck \u00e0 la presse. They half-cook a whole duck, and you put it in a machine and squeeze all the juices out at the table. Then you bring it back in the kitchen, and they make the sauce. You bring it back out and flamb\u00e9 it.Back then, if you didn\u2019t know how to do everything in front of the customer, you didn\u2019t have no job. So all the waiters did it\u2014classic art. And when the ladies came in and sat down, I took their shoes off. In summer, they\u2019d get a cold pillow under their feet. In the winters, hot pillow.You actually did that? You took off their shoes?Of course! It\u2019s part of the service, part of the job. The ladies used to love it. You kidding me? That type of dining doesn\u2019t exist anymore.What was the most exciting part of working in those days?I used to meet all the actors and actresses at the Friars Club. Frank Sinatra, Jerry Lewis, Dean Martin, all those guys. That\u2019s where they hung out. They\u2019d show up together, and all of them was nice. But Frank Sinatra was the nicest guy in the world.What\u2019d they talk about?Ah, that was private. You don\u2019t listen. You\u2019re not supposed to. You don\u2019t want to know their business. I\u2019m not nosy.Did you get any mobsters?No. I don\u2019t know nothin\u2019 about mobsters.Silvio Frlic has worked at Bamonte's for 41 years.\nPhoto by Alex LauWhat\u2019s the craziest thing that ever happened while you were working?Maybe I shouldn\u2019t tell you.Oh, come on.There was two guys always coming with their wives to eat. And one day they came with their girlfriends. They\u2019re eating at a table and I see the wives coming in. So I tell them, and they run to the kitchen, and I put them in the dumbwaiter and send them outside.You put the guys in the dumbwaiter?What are you gonna do? It would\u2019ve been World War III. I didn\u2019t want that to happen. It was the \u201970s, in Manhattan.That\u2019s a good story.No, it\u2019s a true story.What was different at Bamonte\u2019s back then versus now?Nothing. Almost nothing. Food is good, always. Customers are like family, generation after generation. I have more regulars than hairs on my head.How many hairs do you have?I don\u2019t know. There\u2019s quite a few left in the back!What are the biggest changes you\u2019ve seen in the neighborhood?This here used to be all warehouses and factories. Everybody left. They went to China, India, Mexico, Carolinas, Texas. Who ended up with the property? The city. They changed the zone to residential and the prices went through the roof overnight.And now there are expensive bars and restaurants popping up everywhere.Yeah, but not like Bamonte\u2019s. If I go to any of those places, I have to double order. Portions are tiny\u2014all decoration. Over here, they give you the real McCoy. If you eat one dish, you\u2019re satisfied. And besides, it\u2019s good.What do you think of the hipsters that have taken over Williamsburg?Oh, they\u2019re very nice. They come after nine and eat and drink like there\u2019s no tomorrow. But the only thing is: They don\u2019t eat dessert. They get a lot of appetizers, a lot of food on the table\u2014usually too much and I have to tell them to cut it in half. (I\u2019m usually right. It\u2019s always good to talk to the waiter.) But dessert? No. Unless somebody has a birthday. Then, it\u2019s a candle and a piece of cake. Everybody tastes it and that\u2019s it.What about drinks?Mostly they drink wine. When I was working in the \u201960s, \u201970s, if you served a glass of wine every week, it used to be a big deal. Nobody drank wine in those days. Only hard liquor. But these youngsters, mostly wine.What food do you serve them?Well, everything\u2019s good. So I always ask, \u201cWhat are you in the mood for?\u201d A lot of people, they don\u2019t want no menu. They tell me, \u201cJust bring the food.\u201d So I mix it up. Chicken scarpariello\u2014I like it with the bone. Lemon. Butter and white wine. Delicious. If you wanted pork? Pork chop abbamonte, with vinegar pepper, hot and sweet. Delicious. Or shrimp parmigiana, if you like shrimps. Sheesh!Do you eat here yourself?Of course. Mostly every day. Sometimes twice a day if I\u2019m hungry!Have you ever spilled food on anybody at the restaurant?Oh, yeah. Not often. But a guy the other day, he\u2019s going with his hand like this\u2014talking about how big something was\u2014as I was passing by. What are you gonna do? Plate of food to the man; plate\u2019s on the floor. You know why?Why?Because his kids were there. If I didn\u2019t do that, I would\u2019ve burned his kids. He got a little on him, yeah, but I told him, \u201cSuppose I spilled all this hot food on top of your kids?\u201d Then he apologized, said, \u201cYou\u2019re right, you\u2019re right.\u201d Yeah. You don\u2019t want to burn a kid, huh?Certainly not. Do you think you\u2019ll ever retire?When I get tired, I guess. But what am I gonna do all day at home? Eat and drink and watch television? That's not my cup of tea. I\u2019m strong, never been sick, have good legs\u2026.Wait, you\u2019ve never been sick?Never in my life.Never ever?Not even a cold.How is that possible?I don\u2019t know. Good food? I went for a checkup a couple years ago, and the doctor asked me, \u201cWhen was the last time you came for a checkup?\u201d I said, \u201cLet me think. It was 1967 at Fort Hamilton. I was drafted.\u201dHilary Cadigan is an associate editor at Bon App\u00e9tit.Explore Bon App\u00e9titRestaurantsItalian AmericanRed SauceBrooklynRead MorerestaurantsRed Sauce AmericaBy Bon App\u00e9titRecipes you want to make.
