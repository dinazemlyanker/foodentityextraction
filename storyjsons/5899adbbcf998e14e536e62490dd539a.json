From rolling hills lined with neat rows of carefully tended grapevines to roadside stands overflowing with ripe fruit, this green stretch of the world is a must-visit for anyone who appreciates pristine produce bursting with flavor. It only makes sense, then, that the area\u2019s largest city, St. Catharines, is home to an impressive, burgeoning vegan dining scene. With this in mind, we recently went on a quest for plant-based perfection; these are the five spots that any self-respecting vegan (and vegetable lover) should have on their must-visit list.Rise AboveFirst stop on \u201cOperation Vegan\u201d? Rise Above. The Niagara Region\u2019s  first 100-percent-vegan restaurant and bakery promises to be an oasis for those seeking meat- and dairy-free comfort food and fresh-baked goods, and we\u2019re not disappointed. We order the \u201ccheddar\u201d macaroni and cheese, which comes smothered in a velvety cashew cheese sauce and topped with a crunchy broccoli crumb, and the curried cauliflower tacos, packed with spiced chickpeas, tahini, and crispy jalapen\u0303os. We\u2019ll most certainly swing back around at Sunday brunch for the weekly pancake special, which can come topped with anything from a sweet-tart peach crumble to a sticky mix of banana slices, walnuts, and toffee.Bella Noella's PizzeriaBella Noella\u2019s is practically next door to Rise Above, so we pop over for a few slices of hot pizza. We soon realize there\u2019s no need to feel like the odd one out when dining with dairy-eating friends at this quaint, brick-walled spot, because nearly all of its 20-plus pies can be vegan-ified and made with gluten-free crust. We go for the \u201cHawaiian,\u201d which comes topped with pineapple, jackfruit, and marinara sauce, and the \u201cGreek,\u201d which is piled high with pesto, spinach, red onion, tomatoes, and black olives. The pies run big\u2014they fill an entire plate!\u2014but we\u2019re not complaining.The Lemon TreeNext up, we pile in the car and drive across town to The Lemon Tree. (Don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s only 10 minutes away\u2014that\u2019s the benefit of a small town!) It doesn\u2019t look much different from any other strip-mall restaurant at first blush, but once inside we see what the hubbub is about: Owners Billy and Isabella Qorri gave the menu a complete vegan makeover in March. Instead of squid, the \u201ccalamari\u201d features delicately battered and deep-fried root vegetables served with house-made tzatziki. We\u2019re also keen on the savory spinach burek pastries, here constructed with flaky layers of vegan pastry and plant-based feta cheese. Of course, we can\u2019t leave without ordering a fat burger made with Beyond Meat, the meat substitute that\u2019s earned a cult-like following thanks to its ability to \u201cbleed\u201d ruby-red beet juice. Go for dessert, too: Today\u2019s special\u2014a vegan Ferrero Rocher-inspired confection packed with hemp hearts, flax seeds, and coconut\u2014makes our eyes roll into the backs of our heads.Beechwood DoughnutsMoving further into the sweet portion of our tour, we head to Beechwood Doughnuts\u2019 petite glass-enclosed storefront. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau went out of his way to visit this vegan establishment on a trip to the region in 2016, opting for a half-dozen piping-hot, made-fresh-on-site doughnuts blanketed with a craggy topping of cinnamon and sugar. It\u2019s hard to decide what to order\u2014the shop cranks out more than 20 varieties in all, with a menu that rotates daily\u2014but we finally settle on two: a chocolate-glazed s\u2019mores offering capped with a torched marshmallow and a golden-hued tropical number smothered in a sugary dip spiked with orange, pineapple, mango, passion fruit, and guava. We\u2019re pretty sure Justin would approve.Hometown Ice CreamWe save just enough room for a few final treats at Hometown Ice Cream. You won\u2019t find a lick of additives or preservatives in this shop\u2019s all-natural, from-scratch frozen goodies, which span ice cream, sorbet, and sherbet. We go for scoops of the dark rum-infused pin\u0303a colada and roasted peach sorbet, plus a few classics like chocolate and cookie dough. We can\u2019t say no to the homemade pop tarts, though: The jammy, all-vegan raspberry-rhubarb flavor is a real winner, as is the zingy and sweet peach-ginger flavor. Both come slicked with icing and finished with a flourish of sprinkles, and we\u2019re not mad about it.After making the rounds at the best vegan spots around St. Catharines (and testing the limits of our belt buckles), we had to call it a day. But you can bet we\u2019ll be back.Recipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
