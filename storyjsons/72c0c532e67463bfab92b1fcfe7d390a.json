Wobbly, barely-holding-together silken tofu cubes, doused in inky shoyu and sprinkled with wisps of scallions. Medium-firm hunks, sunken at the bottom of miso soup. Very solid square units, thrown into a well-oiled pan and attentively nudged and flipped until each side was pocked with burn marks.It was less that I liked tofu and more that it was a requisite protein. If these dinners were an early 2000s teen rom-com, tofu would be the geeky wallflower (with amazing cheekbones hidden by thick-rimmed glasses), always around but never really noticed.Fast-forward to summer 2019. The Feel Good Food Plan dropped and there was tofu\u2014but like I\u2019d never seen it before: It was high gloss and heaped atop of tahini-laced noodles with gingery cucumber slices. Cue all the wallflower transformation scenes in She\u2019s All That and The Princess Diaries (glasses, begone!). Tofu is pretty hot, huh?In this recipe, the humble protein gets a serious makeover. First it\u2019s lightly fried in a pan until golden and crispy all over, and then it\u2019s glazed with an addictive shoyu-honey-chile sauce until it achieves the extremely satisfying state of crispy-gone-soggy. The dry, crunchy exterior acts as a sponge for the thick, saucy glaze. Think of it like the tofu version of Panda Express orange chicken (and don\u2019t be mistaken: That\u2019s a huge compliment).But what makes this recipe even better is the noodles and the quick pickles. When soba is tossed in nutty tahini and a little bit of rice vinegar, you get something akin to cold sesame noodles but with more richness and depth. The Persian cucumbers, salted, squeezed, and tossed with rice vinegar, are the perfect fresh, puckery counterpoint.Nowadays, tofu isn\u2019t an afterthought or a supplement but the thing I most look forward to for dinner. I only cook based on impulse and craving, and this recipe has become my go-to when I can\u2019t make up my mind.I\u2019m still living in a tofu household. But this time it\u2019s because I love it like it deserved to be loved all along.Get the recipe:Sesame Noodles with Crispy TofuThe trick to this recipe is using the pan sauce as a base for the sesame noodles.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titNever FailRecipes you want to make.
