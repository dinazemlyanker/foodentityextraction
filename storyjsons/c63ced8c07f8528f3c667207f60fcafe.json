Smoked goat meat? \u201cOh, we got a smoker.\u201d Opening a restaurant in San Francisco\u2019s savage real estate market? \u201cI got lucky; the owners of a shared kitchen space offered me a chance.\u201d In reality, Adebajo\u2019s path to opening Eko Kitchen, the city\u2019s first exclusively Nigerian restaurant, is a tale of focus and determination, one that includes jollof parties for hungry students and copious amounts of organic palm oil held for questioning at U.S Customs. \u201cIt took a minute,\u201d she smiles. No big deal.But it is. When Adebajo tweeted in April: \u201cSo I\u2019ve quit my job as a financial analyst to open the first #Nigerian restaurant in the city of San Francisco. Tbh I\u2019m not sure of exactly what I\u2019m doing but I\u2019ll do my best with what I have,\u201d it was retweeted over 15,000 times and stacked up 2,000 replies (probably more by the time you read this). The food community in San Francisco, and around the country, was ready to show up in support. That\u2019s how contagious Adebajo\u2019s dreams are.Now Eko Kitchen shares its location with a casual Mexican restaurant that occupies the space during the week, while Eko opens Friday through Sunday. Every Friday, Adebajo and her team of five swoop in, decorate the walls with Nigerian art, adorn the tables with traditional figurines, and cover the bar in traditional woven cloth. By Monday it\u2019s gone, until next week, hidden in the back of the restaurant. On the menu, however, dishes make a lasting impression. \u201cMy family is well-to-do, so my reality of Lagos isn\u2019t everyone\u2019s reality; there\u2019s great income inequality [in Nigeria],\u201d she says. \u201cBut everyone eats, and our food scene is so untapped. There\u2019s very little representation of West African restaurants in the Bay Area.\u201dAdebajo getting ready to eat Iyan (pounded yam) with Egusi soup and chicken\nPhoto by Alanna HaleAdebajo, 24, moved to San Francisco from Lagos to obtain a master\u2019s degree in international development economics at USF. She started cooking for herself and friends, steadily increasing the circle of those who craved her jollof and plantains. \u201cI figured if my classmates like the food, I must be doing something right. If I already cook so much, why not make it a legitimate business?\u201d In June of last year, while working during the week as a financial analyst, she launched a weekend delivery service out of a shared kitchen space and threw occasional pop-up events. This spring, Adebajo found a permanent, if shared, home for Eko Kitchen. During the week she runs a corporate catering operation, providing staff lunches to tech companies and financial institutions.The colorful space is transformed on weekends.\nPhoto by Alanna HaleThe menu, different each day of the weekend, reflects the Lagos lifestyle. On Friday night it\u2019s all about spicy and simple \u201cbeer parlor food,\u201d according to Adebajo, like marinated skewered beef and \u201cNigerian Shawarma.\u201d Saturdays, the menu is \u201crelaxed, like you\u2019re spending time with your Nigerian mother,\u201d with comforting dishes like jollof pasta and chicken gizzards. And on Sunday\u2014the night I went\u2014following an unspoken Lagos tradition, rice dishes dominate along with heavier family-style meals. Shazam-worthy Nigerian hip-hop played in the background while I tried pounded Nigerian yam that came wrapped in plastic, like a ball of dough, alongside efo riro, a thick soup made with a fragrant pepper sauce, spinach, and fermented locust beans. The tiny round beans flavor many of the dishes with a hint of sour and bitter, and make the spices spicier. I ate sweet plantains, honey-glazed chicken wings, and moi moi, a steamed black-eyed-pea pur\u00e9e with mackerel that\u2019s baked in banana leaves. The windowless restaurant was filled with Nigerian customers shrieking with joy at the sight of familiar dishes, and other couples and families who were here to try something new.The locust beans\u2014iru in Yoruba\u2014as well as the organic palm oil, are some of the ingredients Adebajo imports personally from Nigeria alongside Nigerian honey beans and yam tubers. \u201cIt\u2019s really exciting that I\u2019m able to make the dishes with authentic ingredients from Nigeria, straight from the farmers,\u201d Adebajo says. To obtain cow skin\u2014a common ingredient in the restaurant\u2019s ayamase stew of beef, tripe, and cow skin\u2014she sent quite a few emails to some surprised managers of beef-processing facilities before getting what she needed. Eventually, a Nigerian farmer in Sacramento understood her needs and became a regular supplier. \u201cCustomers often ask me what it is that they\u2019re chewing and loving so much, and I go, \u2018I\u2019ll tell you if you really want to know!\u2019\u201d Adebajo laughs.Since that April tweet, Eko Kitchen continues to scale new heights, with no PR efforts or even a sign to mark its location. Another recent tweet describes Adebajo falling asleep while sitting down, fully clothed. But that won\u2019t stop her: \u201cMy plan for the future is to continue to share Nigerian food with people in cities where there is a gap in the market for West African flavors,\u201d she says.
