But have you seen the croissant? Ever since Konbi opened last fall, I have double-tapped and saved almost every photo of the shatteringly-flaky, so-damn-chocolatey confection. I just had to know how they got it that way. Here chefs Akira Akuto and Nick Montgomery break down the pastry I can\u2019t stop thinking about.The ButterChef-owners Akira Akuto and Nick Montgomery tried \u201ca crazy amount\u201d of butter before finding the One. The winner was Anchor\u2019s butter sheets (made specifically for layered pastries like these) from New Zealand. Buying the butter already formed into long, thin sheets makes for a more consistent texture.The dough gets a sprinkling of King Arthur's Sir Galahad flour.\nPhoto by Alex LauThe FlourThe Konbi team ate the croissant at Tokyo\u2019s Path restaurant every day on a research trip. So they tapped Rihito Maruhashi, Path\u2019s pastry chef, to help develop their own recipe. His steepest learning curve? American flour. They chose King Arthur\u2019s Sir Galahad, a low-protein bread flour similar to what Maruhashi used in Japan.The small but mighty lamination machine.\nPhoto by Alex LauThe LaminationThose layers take work. In a process known as lamination, first the dough gets folded over butter, then it\u2019s flattened into slabs by a machine called a sheeter. Konbi relies on a rare Yoshida model with a small footprint since the caf\u00e9 is about 520 square feet. They make just 36 croissants a day, building up the hype.Two chocolate batons are wrapped into every croissant.\nPhoto by Alex LauThe ChocolateYes, the croissant passes the critical \u201cIs there chocolate in every bite?\u201d test. To ensure this, the team uses flatter-and-wider-than-usual chocolate batons from France\u2019s Cacao Barry and expands the dough\u2019s gluten structure so it\u2019s strong enough to keep the chocolate from sinking to the bottom of the pastry.Rolled up and ready to go in the oven.\nPhoto by Alex LauThe FlareWith most chocolate croissants, the lip of dough is tucked underneath itself before baking to help keep the pastry contained. Not at Konbi. By pushing the laminated folds apart and leaving the lip exposed and untucked, they\u2019re able to create these signature cascading stairway-like flaky layers.Explore Bon App\u00e9titPastryRestaurantsDish DecodedRead MorerestaurantsThe Long and Winding Road to Richmond's Most Ambitious New Restaurant\u2014in One DishBy Elyse InamineRecipes you want to make.
