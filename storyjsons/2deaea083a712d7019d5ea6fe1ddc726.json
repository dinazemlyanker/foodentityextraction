Pro tip: If you sign up for the newsletter, you'll get the scoop before everyone else.Healthyish friends,It\u2019s been nearly a month since my last newsletter and, well, I\u2019ve missed you! So much has happened: a new decade, a new Feel Good Food Plan, a new Healthyish issue of Bon App\u00e9tit. If you\u2019re not already a subscriber, you can find the issue at Whole Foods or...your local airport? (Where do people buy magazines these days?)Here on the internet, we just launched 20 Ways to Feel Better in 2020. It\u2019s got a lot of our best tips from the Healthyish issue, like these summer-in-winter recipes from Lil\u2019 Deb\u2019s Oasis (drooling over that braised chicken), a guide to getting exactly what you want at a dispensary, and wise words from Samin Nosrat on her ongoing journey toward loving the body she\u2019s in.I also wrote something; it\u2019s about trying to date while trying not to drink. Spoiler: I failed. There\u2019s more I could\u2019ve said about that summer of 16 first dates that page space (and propriety\u2014it\u2019s a food magazine, people!) didn\u2019t allow. I do want to mention that deciding whether to drink or not drink is a privilege, that people with substance abuse problems don\u2019t have the luxury of choosing so casually, and that it did kind of freak me out when I realized how strong the pull of alcohol could be.What else is going on? I made some resolutions. The BA Test Kitchen made some more important resolutions. I reread this timeless Joan Didion essay and thought a lot about self-respect. I watched so much TV and so many movies and remembered all the big boys of 2019 who I loved, including Adam Driver even though I thought his character in Marriage Story was both dull and ingratiating and I much prefer Sam Rockwell in Fosse/Verdon for my boys-behaving-badly fix. On the flip side, the soapy-as-ever L Word redux and Greta Gerwig\u2019s already classic Little Women made me think that my life could use more strong female leads\u2014and that men can just be background characters sometimes. (The Academy has not gotten this memo.)Besides watching television, I\u2019ve gotten into Broccoli magazine\u2019s weed podcast and Rachelle Robinett\u2019s Supernatural Series, which has me experimenting with breakfast concoctions that look like mud and taste like health but actually keep me full until lunch (a rare feat). And I\u2019ve realized that, more than any sort of visioning or manifesting or Co\u2014Star-ing or dry-brushing, the best way to get what I want is to put it on my Trello list.So here\u2019s to more list-making, less mindless drinking, more greens but also fudge, less money stress, more female friendships, and to feeling better in 2020...whatever that looks like for you.Until next week,Amanda ShapiroHealthyish EditorExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishHealthyish NewsletteressayRead MoreLifestyleI Think About These a LotBy Amanda ShapiroRecipes you want to make.
