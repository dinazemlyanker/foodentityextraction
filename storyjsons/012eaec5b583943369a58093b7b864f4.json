Don\u2019t believe me? Head to the trendiest neighborhood you know, then look around for an aesthetically pleasing cafe. You know, the one with a flat white on the menu, great lighting, and an unfairly attractive barista behind the millennial pink La Marzocco? Those signs all point to one thing: Australia.So, really, it's fitting that a modern spin on coffee liqueur is coming from the land down under (sorry, but I had to get at least one Men At Work reference in here). It\u2019s called Mr. Black, and it\u2019s the most caffeinated and art-directed cold brew liqueur around. Each bottle has 25% ABV, and 1100 mg of caffeine per liter, which breaks down to around ten times more caffeine than familiar coffee liqueurs like Kahl\u00faa. Still, a shot of Mr. Black is like \u00bd to \u2153 a shot of espresso, not quite as big of a bang as a your regular morning latte, but palpable.This potent union of alcohol and caffeine\u2014hey, remember when Four Loko was legal?\u2014combines\nAustralian wheat vodka with three top-grade Arabica coffee beans: Baroida Estate, Kutere Microlot, and the Ngila Coffee Estate. Each variety is roasted separately to maximize the individual flavor potential. It\u2019s a fussy move, but one that should soothe the coffee snobs waiting to pounce in the comment section. (As a former barista, I can say that.) And the results speak for themselves: a smooth and fresh-tasting coffee liqueur that\u2019s decidedly coffee first, vodka second.Oh how convenient, it's Irish coffee season.\nMatt DuckorBut you can still tell there\u2019s alcohol in here. The tell-tale whiff of alcohol is muted but present. Really, this is meant to make some caffeinated cocktails. I\u2019d advise against adding sweetener, as a straight-up shot of Mr. Black tastes about as sweet as spiked diner coffee.Mix it into a \u201ccold fashioned\u201d with rye whiskey and orange bitters, fortify a coffee Mai Tai, or water it down with seltzer for a take on the coffee-seltzer drink cool kids are into these days. Drink some to kick off a big night out, rent The Big Lebowski on iTunes and make a White Russian with it, or pour a little splash over your favorite ice cream for an alcoholic take on an affogato. Mr. Black is destined to appear at your next boozy brunch\u2014and if you\u2019re not looking to day drink, what are you really doing reading about caffeinated alcohol in the first place?At around $40 a bottle, this is definitely a craft coffee liqueur\u2014we also like St. George\u2019s, which has notes of chicory and clocks in at $35. The bottle, an array of line drawings reminiscent of a design school tarot card, helps soften the blow. The more you pour, the more of the drawing is revealed. Incentivized drinking! When my bottle is empty, I plan to keep it as a vase. It would accommodate approximately one sunflower, which somehow, feels fitting.Buy a 750 ml bottle of Mr. Black for $40Then spike your next affogato:Explore Bon App\u00e9titcold brewCoffeeLiqueurAlcoholicAlcohol & Other DrinksTrends + NewsRead MorecultureForget Gin, We Have a New Favorite Partner for TonicBy Alex DelanyRecipes you want to make.
