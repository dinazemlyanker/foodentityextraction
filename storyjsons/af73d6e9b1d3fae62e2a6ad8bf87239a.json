We think 16\u201320 per pound are the perfect size, and that\u2019s what this recipe was developed for (the size will be printed on the bag the shrimp are packaged in, or ask your fishmonger). If you end up with a different size, just follow these guidelines: For 26\u201330, poach 1\u00bd minutes; for 21\u201325, poach 2 minutes; for 13\u201315, poach 4 minutes; for 8\u201312, poach 5 minutes.

This whole process is so easy, and the outcome is so delicious. TylerLafayette, Indiana2/15/2021This is the best shrimp cocktail I've ever had. I've been making it since the recipe came out. Thank you!MoonrisecheesecoCanandaigua, NY1/16/2021Hey there, J V again. I decided not to remake the cocktail sauce. I let it sit out for about an hour-ish, and the volatiles in the horseradish escaped from the sauce. It was delicious after that. J V (again)Denver, Co1/3/2021I've never had cocktail sauce before, so maybe it's supposed to be overwhelmingly composed of horseradish, but I couldn't eat this without wincing with each bite. Why do we use 2 tablespoons?J VDenver, CO1/3/2021Explore Bon App\u00e9titShrimpShellfishSeafoodHorseradishHerbs & SpicesLemonCitrusFruitQuickEasyStarterDairy-FreeNut-FreeFourth Of JulyMemorial DayLabor DayDinnerRecipes you want to make.
