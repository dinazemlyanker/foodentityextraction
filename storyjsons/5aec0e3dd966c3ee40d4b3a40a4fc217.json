And we asked them to do it while filming Making Perfect, a six-part video series documenting every success and setback. Somehow, it all worked out...perfectly. Here\u2019s how the Squash and Radicchio Salad With Pecans and the Brussels Sprouts With Pistachios and Lime came together.Find all of the recipes from the Absolutely, Positively Perfect Thanksgiving menu here.The Dream TeamChristina Chaey and Claire SaffitzThe ChallengeA good side needs to do several things: It needs to be low-effort, but it should also veer off the beaten path (something spicy! Ingredients your guest may have never tried before!). It\u2019s also a prime opportunity to add texture to an otherwise mushy-in-a-good-way meal. Oh, and \u201cvegetables.\u201dThe SolutionExhibit A: This squash- centric salad with an irresistible pecan dressing and hardy radicchio that refuses to wilt. Exhibit B: Roasted whole brussels sprouts that get so crispy on the outside you\u2019ll worry they\u2019re burnt (they\u2019re not!), coated in a date molasses\u2013 brown butter glaze.Watch Claire and Christina make the perfect Thanksgiving sides\nMeet the 898This palm-size squash, a new cousin of the beloved honeynut developed by vegetable breeder\u2013mad genius Michael Mazourek, tastes like a turbocharged butternut, making you question every squash you\u2019ve ever had before. It\u2019s now rolling out at farmers markets, select grocery stores, and online grocers across the country. If you can\u2019t find it, honeynut or butternut will also work fine.The tiny 898 squash, up close and personal.\nPhoto by Alex LauDried Fruit Vs. Fresh FruitChristina and Claire knew they wanted to add sweetness to the salad, but how? Dried cherries and apricots were early contenders (they\u2019re easy to find and always in season), but Asian pear won out. The dried fruit was chewy; the pear was juicy, a better counterbalance to the other ingredients. All of the crisp elements make \u201cthis salad a welcome respite from gravy and buttertown,\u201d says Christina.Do-AheadRoast the squash a day before, store it in the fridge, and warm it up in the microwave or leave at room temp when serving.Get the recipe:Squash and Radicchio Salad With PecansThis squash-centric salad has an irresistible pecan dressing and hardy radicchio that refuses to wilt.View RecipeHalve Not Your Brussels SproutsWe start the brussels at a high heat to get the outer leaves charred and crackling, then lower the heat to finish. Keeping the brussels whole traps in steam, so the centers get creamy without drying out. It\u2019s a nice ~textural contrast.~ \u201cThey should be mushy on the inside, and mushy isn\u2019t a bad thing,\u201d says Claire. \u201cI don\u2019t want al dente brussels sprouts.\u201d Use small to medium-sized sprouts, the giant ones will take longer to cook and you\u2019ll risk (actually) burning the exteriors.Christina Chaey and Claire Saffitz during the filming of Making Perfect.\nPhoto by Emma FishmanThe Ingredient: Date MolassesTypically made from dates and nothing else, date molasses brings a deep, fruity sweetness and a bit of tartness. Its thick consistency means it makes an easy, near-instant glaze. The test kitchen uses Al Wadi Al Akhdar brand, but you could also use this 100 percent date syrup.Buy it: Al Wadi Al Akhdar Date Molasses, $13 on AmazonGet the recipe:Brussels Sprouts With Pistachios and LimeThese roasted whole brussels sprouts get so crispy you\u2019ll worry they\u2019re burnt (they\u2019re not!).
