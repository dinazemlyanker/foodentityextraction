The red bites inevitably appear in the most inconvenient spots: fingers, ankles, that one part of my back that I can\u2019t reach. After returning home from a few long picnics and patio dinners with more than my fair share of itchy souvenirs, I made a midsummer resolution to apply bug spray as I do SPF: every time I leave my apartment. But first, I had to stock up.Luckily, an internet friend told me about Kinfield\u2019s Golden Hour, a DEET-free bug spray that uses Indonesian citronella to keep mosquitos away. I\u2019ll be honest: I dabble in natural skincare, but the idea of using natural bug spray had me unconvinced. Avoiding mosquitos, I figured after years of being personally targeted by them, was a job for chemicals. But my DEET-heavy repellent felt too intense for daily use in the city. (DEET, which was developed by the US Army in 1946, is generally harmless, but it can cause skin irritation in high doses and is toxic when swallowed.) The scent alone was strong enough that I didn\u2019t want to apply it indoors, and I don\u2019t have a balcony or patio to pop onto for a quick spray.Thanks to the addition of vanillin and cloves, Golden Hour actually smells good. I\u2019ve even had strangers ask what scent I\u2019m wearing. But more importantly: It works. I\u2019ve tested Golden Hour both in the city and countryside, and so far I\u2019m happily bite-free. (The one day I forgot to apply some while barbecuing upstate, I definitely reaped the itchy consequences.) I spritz my knees, ankles, and other most-bitten areas before leaving the house, and carry the 0.8 oz travel spray in my bag to reapply in case I\u2019m out around dusk. I\u2019ll probably still pack the DEET for serious camping, but now I'm never left in the park after dark without protection. My ankles are grateful.Photo by Emma FishmanKinfield Golden Hour Natural Bug Spray$22 at Grove Collaborative$22 at Thrive MarketExplore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingPicnicSummerRecipes you want to make.
