I still can\u2019t get over that.By Alex BeggsAugust 29, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Trap-StudioFacebookTwitterEmailThis is Highly Recommend, a column dedicated to our very opinionated editors\u2019 favorite things to eat, drink, and buy.When you\u2019re in the cherry capital of the world...I really think you should try the Michigan shrimp. It\u2019s at my favorite restaurant in my boyfriend\u2019s hometown of Traverse City\u2014scratch that, the entire state of Michigan (but honestly! I\u2019ve been to many other cities!). At Alliance, chef James Bloomfield leads a tiny team of seven to cook food inspired by the cheffy cookbooks on the shelves above the bar\u2014from Zahav to Momofuku to Tokyo New Wave. Initially the share-able menu seems slightly all over the place: beets with za\u2019atar, fried chicken, rabbit carnitas, cherry tomato toast. But it works in the way that the things we crave are all over the place. Nothing is overthought, overwrought, or underseasoned. Every bite is fabulous, especially the kinilaw, a Filipino ceviche made with Michigan shrimp and a crazy good coconut broth. It\u2019s been a menu standby for the three years Alliance has been open and I knew our party of three would require two orders on my most recent visit, because some share plates I have trouble sharing.Michigan shrimp? Yeah, I still can\u2019t get over that. It\u2019s sustainably raised in Okemos, Michigan, at ECA (Environmentally Conscious Aquaculture) Farms\u2014kind of a mouthful name, but they have a fascinating tank setup that produces clean-tasting, tender pink-shelled shrimp that aren\u2019t as briny as the Gulf shrimp I grew up with. At the restaurant, they sous-vide the shrimp until they\u2019re slightly bouncy, and then serve in a light, chilled coconut broth with lemongrass, ginger, chile oil, lime juice, coconut vinegar, and cilantro stems. It\u2019s creamy, tangy, and ridiculously flavorful, making you come back for spoonful after spoonful. Soak up the leftover broth with sous chef Becca Snook\u2019s squishy, crispy-crusted white bread.To accompany, sommelier Andrew Kemp\u2019s wines are thoughtful and fun. If you\u2019re excited about wine and show it, he\u2019ll open something for you that\u2019s \u201cin the back\u201d\u2014leftover from special events and other coveted bottles too low in quantity to add to the wine list. We had a bubbly Austrian blanc de blancs that tasted like Champagne meets cream soda. Paired with the kinilaw, can you imagine anything better?Go there (from Wednesday to Sunday only): AllianceExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendMichiganShrimpRead MorerestaurantsSecret Sandwiches Beat All Other Lunch OptionsBy Alex BeggsRecipes you want to make.
