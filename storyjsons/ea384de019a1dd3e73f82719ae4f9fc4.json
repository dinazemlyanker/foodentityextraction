Having worked alongside David for (not even kidding) more than ten years, I know that when he says realness, he means it. It\u2019s not just an ethos that he applies to everything on the Epicurious site; realness is David\u2019s way of life. Which is why it didn\u2019t surprise me that one January, he challenged himself to make three meals a day, with very few repeats, for the entire month, a project he dubbed \u201cCOOK90.\u201d That project is now a book (buy it!), which is, I\u2019m happy to say, our January selection for the Bon App\u00e9tit Cookbook Club.In a world of aspiration and lifestyle and glitter bagels and CBD water, COOK90 is the ultimate distillation of \u201chome-cook realness,\u201d to use David\u2019s terminology. It\u2019s not about the latest iteration of Keto or how amazing your life will be if you eat cold oats that have been sitting in your fridge overnight. The COOK90 book is unflinching in its dedication to recipes, tools, and strategies that make weeknight cooking not just possible but enjoyable\u2014like a gift to yourself rather than an end-of-day chore. And the concept is totally, refreshingly un-prescriptive: Cook the recipes in the book, or simply cook whatever you want. Either way, you\u2019re still doing COOK90.Before David walks over here and says that I am telling people they don\u2019t need to buy the book and can just cook whatever recipes they want, let me just add one final note: Even as someone who is pretty much resigned to being what I\u2019ll call a \u201cCook9\u201d (and that\u2019s in a good month, and yes I\u2019m including breakfast in that figure), David\u2019s perspective on cooking is so smart and practical, and his voice is so candid and\u2014yes\u2014real, that he makes the prospect of cooking 90 meals in 30 days feel not just accomplishable but truly rewarding.Later this month, we\u2019ll be sharing some of our favorite recipes from the book. And in lieu of a blowout Cookbook Club dinner, we\u2019re all going to bring \u201cnextovers\u201d (the COOK90 term for non-depressing leftovers) to work one day and trade lunches with each other. That, my friends, is realness.Pick up a copy of COOK90 wherever you buy cookbooks. And if you want to learn more about the BA Cookbook Club and how to start your own club, you\u2019ll find all that right here.Explore Bon App\u00e9titcookbook clubRecipes you want to make.
