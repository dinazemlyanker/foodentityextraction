The mochiko, or sweet rice flour, is what gives the cake its unique texture, and the earthy matcha and bittersweet chocolate make it not too sweet. In the spirit of the Hawaiian butter mochi that inspired the recipe, it requires minimal equipment and comes together in the time it takes the oven to heat up. Do take the time to sift the matcha, however\u2014it ensures that there aren\u2019t any dry bits in the final cake\u2014and splurge for ceremonial-grade matcha if you want the most vibrant color possible.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Diamond Crystal or \u00bc tsp. Morton kosher salt2Tbsp. matcha, sifted, plus more for serving2large eggs114-oz. can sweetened condensed milk1tsp. vanilla extract1\u2153cups heavy cream, divided4oz. bittersweet chocolate, choppedPreparationStep 1Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 350\u00b0. Generously butter an 8\"- or 9\"-diameter cake pan. Whisk mochiko, baking powder, salt, and 2 Tbsp. matcha in a large bowl just to combine. Vigorously whisk eggs and melted butter in a medium bowl until pale and emulsified, about 30 seconds. Add sweetened condensed milk, vanilla, and 1 cup cream and whisk until mixture is smooth. Scrape into dry ingredients and whisk vigorously until smooth and very thick. Scrape batter into prepared pan and smooth surface.Step 2Bake cake until it starts to pull away from sides of pan, top and edges are golden, and a tester inserted into the center comes out clean, 35\u201345 minutes (cake in the smaller pan will take longer to bake than one in the larger pan). Transfer pan to a wire rack and let cake cool 5 minutes. Turn cake out onto rack; let cool completely.Step 3Place chocolate in a small heatproof bowl. Bring remaining \u2153 cup cream to a boil in a small saucepan. Immediately pour over chocolate; let sit 15 seconds. Stir until ganache is smooth.Step 4Evenly pour ganache over top of cake. Using a small offset spatula or spoon, spread ganache to edges of cake (drips down the sides are encouraged!). Let sit until ganache is set, about 2 hours. (If you are in a hurry, you can chill cake until glaze is set, about 30 minutes.)Step 5Just before serving, dust top of cake with more matcha with a fine-mesh sieve.Do ahead: Cake and glaze can be made 2 days ahead. Store cake tightly wrapped in several layers of plastic at room temperature. Let glaze cool, then chill in an airtight container. Gently reheat glaze in the microwave or a double boiler over a pan of simmering water (do not let bowl touch water) until just melted before using.How would you rate Chocolate-Matcha Butter Mochi Cake?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (20)Back to TopTriangleGreat! Cake! I sifted the matcha, but sifting all the dry ingredients is what dreams are made of :) It came out so dense, I was worried it was dry, but thankfully nope! I doubled the ganache and it didn\u2019t disappoint to have a thick layer chocolate on top. Ate it in a hotspring and celebrated a dear friend with sake. Easy peazy \ud83d\udc9aMadelineReno, NV3/22/2022Has anyone used a 9\" Springform Pan for this?\nBeckyMooseRiver Hills, Wi3/19/2022So fun! This cake is super easy to make once you have all the ingredients. We really liked it. Anonymous3/13/2022I\u2019m not really a cake person, and I\u2019ve never baked with Matcha before. But OMG I loved this. Great texture and not too sweet. My partner has already had three pieces and had to stop himself from having a fourth. Always a good sign. \ud83d\ude02 Perfect as written. Will definitely make again.SadiePortland3/13/2022This cake totally failed for me. While it mixed up fine (I weighed and did not use the cup measurements), it baked terrifically unevenly, cracked a Grand Canyon while baking, stayed so moist inside that I had to leave it in until it was distressingly brown on top. Then the ganache mixed up so thick that it did not run down the sides. \n\n\nThe flavor was good, but the whole thing was a claggy mess. I have no idea whether I over-mixed or maybe my scale malfunctioned? It didn\u2019t work. It\u2019s worth a do over, for sure though. Rachel S.New York, NY3/13/2022One of the best cakes I\u2019ve made, and I bake A LOT. It\u2019s so unique and we honestly can\u2019t stop eating it. If you want more sweetness, you can add 1/3 cup of sugar, but it\u2019s so floral and grassy with the cake and the chocolate that it\u2019s really perfect. Jake BakesSaint Paul, MN 3/5/2022I was tasked with making a chocolate post-apocalyptic cake for a friend's birthday just as I pulled the latest magazine from my mailbox. This cake, featured on the cover, appeared to be the perfect solution, and it was! I will try it again as many liked it though I thought it was a bit too dry. I will try measuring the mochiko by weight. I used a 10 x 2\" aluminum fluted tart pan and it gave the cake more presence. This was fun to make.AnonymousNew York, NY2/28/2022I really enjoyed this cake\u2014I used tapioca flour instead of sweet rice flour because that's what I had on hand. The middle of the cake sunk, which upon googling I found is a common problem with gluten free desserts (Don't use a stand mixer and over mix the dry ingredients). All this being said, it reminded me a lot of mochi donuts, which as a gluten free person, is my favorite dessert. Everyone at the dinner party had seconds and agreed this cake is fabulous. Thank you Christina! AllynBrooklyn, NY2/28/2022The texture of this cake is really fun - dense, moist, and fluffy all at the same time. Definitely one of the best gluten-free cake textures I've encountered. It might be new to someone that is unfamiliar with mochi or rice flour desserts, but it was a hit in my family. I really enjoyed the combination of matcha and chocolate and think the amount of matcha recommended by the recipe is perfect. I will likely add some sugar the next time I make it, as it was slightly bitter between the matcha and the chocolate. I also plan to use a wider cake pan to get a flatter cake, as mine sank a lot when it cooled down. I will absolutely be making this again, with a few adjustments. Don't be deterred by the negative reviews! Also thank you to the person from \"I can't believe these people\" for the LOL's.SashaJersey City, NJ2/28/2022Added 1/3 cup granulated sugar with eggs & melted butter step. Most mochi recipes are only delicious the day of, but this one lasts as it was still really good on day 2 with a soft 10 second microwave warm up. I stored in glass airtight container.MunchieChicago, IL2/25/2022I thought it was pretty good despite the few negative reviews. It\u2019s definitely not too sweet, just as the description says. I didn\u2019t think the matcha was TOO strong, that\u2019s the point of the cake. I thought the bittersweet chocolate was enough to counter the earthy flavor from the matcha. The texture of the cake is soft and dense but not dry, and a bit chewy (in a good way). It\u2019s very easy to make, I would give it a try if you know you like matcha and desserts that are not super sweet and decadent. MaddoPhiladelphia, PA2/24/2022I was skeptical given the divided reviews, but I love matcha and wanted to give this a shot. This turned out delicious. The matcha cake was just sweet enough and had a perfect bouncy, chewy texture. The chocolate ganache complimented the cake well. I passed on dusting the top with matcha, just didn't love the appearance of it. Aan easy and impressive cake that I will certainly make again. Alex B. Seattle, WA2/20/2022It's telling that the worst ratings for this cake are from people in the literal middle of Nowhere, USA, whose reviews make it painfully obvious that they have never eaten anything other than Kraft macaroni & cheese or Oreos. Do the rest of the world a favor: if you have the food habits of a Midwest toddler, don't bother commenting. You're embarrassing yourself.I Can't Believe These People2/19/2022This was requested as an 11th birthday cake and was a big hit among the family. Big Sis and I opted to add in some powdered sugar to the dry ingredients (just eyeballing, less than1/4 cup) and resifted everything. We used semi-sweet chocolate for the ganache and chose not to dust with matcha, and it was not too bitter, not too sweet for us. We liked the texture of the cake a lot and will make again. It was a very vibrant green!AnonymousVirginia2/19/2022I just started getting Bon Appetit magazine for my two teens, as they have become pretty good bakers and cooks. They took one look at the photo of this cake and wanted to know why it had moss growing on it. That is one unappetizing photo. The cake was weird tasting, although the one they baked looked just like the unappealing photo.
