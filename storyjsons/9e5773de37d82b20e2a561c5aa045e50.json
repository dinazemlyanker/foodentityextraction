We're going mesh this year.By Aliza AbarbanelJuly 3, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Alex LauFacebookTwitterEmailIn the summer, New York vibrates with potential. With a good pair of sneakers and a water bottle, we can walk for miles and stumble into hectic street fairs, sprawling farmers\u2019 markets, the random, surprisingly excellent stoop sale. Our biggest problem\u2014besides the occasional garbage smell\u2014is carrying all the odds and ends we pick up along the way. Because who wants to haul around an extra tote in the sweltering heat? Enter Junes hold-everything mesh bags, which are breathable, strong, and fold into a small square about as large as a deck of cards. Throw one in your work purse or jean pocket, and you'll be prepared for peak-season peaches,  flea-market gems, and whatever else catches your eye.Junes mesh drawstring bag makes it easy to go plastic-free at the farmers' market.\nPhoto by Alex LauIn addition to being super functional, Junes bags are also fun to look at. The classic is a roomy, throw-it-all-in-there tote with a built-in side pocket for stashing some cash. Planning a picnic? Junes bottle pocket has built-in pockets for two bottles (Pet-nat?, Orangina? Pick your poison), that even the load and minimize awkward clanking. The mesh drawstring carry-alls can be used to stow anything from onions to phone chargers, but we like them best as an individual produce bag for anything with soft skin (stone fruit, berries, tomatoes). All the bags are hand-washable\u2014or wash them on the delicate cycle and hang them to dry.We also love that Junes is partnered with Centra Santa Catalina, an independent women\u2019s sewing cooperative in Ju\u00e1rez, Mexico that creates half their stocklist. A percentage of each bag goes to the Global Fund for Women, a nonprofit organization working to prevent femicide and violence against women.With a Junes bag or two in your purse, you'll never be the person who forgets her bags at the grocery store. You can finally get rid of that pile of plastic ones that've been collecting dust in a dank kitchen corner. And when you take a stroll and stumble across the most perfect peak-season tomatoes you've ever seen, you'll have just the thing to put them in.Buy Junes bags, starting at $20Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishShoppingRead MoreLifestyle7 Products For a Cool, Calm, and Delicious SummerGallery7 SlidesBy Liza MyersRecipes you want to make.
