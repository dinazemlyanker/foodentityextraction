But Has Anything Really Changed?Americans continue to expect that food will make us healthier, more virtuous, and thinner.By Alex BeggsJanuary 10, 2022FacebookTwitterEmailIllustration by John GallFacebookTwitterEmail\u201cI\u2019m like everybody else,\u201d says ConAgra CEO Mike Harper as he walks into a private airplane hangar. \u201cI lead a busy life.\u201d In the 1989 commercial Harper tells the camera that after he had a heart attack he couldn\u2019t find \u201chealthy food that was really great-tasting.\u201d So he invented Healthy Choice. Cut to a glamour shot of the low-fat, low-sodium, low-cholesterol frozen dinners: a sectioned oval tray with gravy-covered sirloin tips, a side of baby carrots, potatoes, and a fruit-topped dessert. By the end of the spot, Harper is piloting his little blue propeller plane off the runway.\u00a0In the three years following that ad, Healthy Choice would rake in $1 billion in sales. And it was hardly alone. Lean Cuisine, Diet Coke, Crystal Light, Bud Light: Diet food became a juggernaut in the 1980s thanks to a winning combo of government influence, food tech, and good old-fashioned societal pressure to be thin. And in the years following, the industry would only grow. We don\u2019t like to call it diet food anymore, but in 2020 foods with a dietary claim made over $100 billion.From the moment in 1898 when J.H. Kellogg introduced Toasted Corn Flakes to get our digestion on track and help stave off the urge to \u201cself-pollute\u201d (masturbate), we\u2019ve looked to food to make us healthier, more virtuous, and, yes, thinner. Has it worked? Not really. So why do we keep expecting it to?What was going on in the \u201980s? (Other than leotards)Let\u2019s crack open a can of Diet Coke, put on those leg warmers, and step back in time for a moment. In 1977 a Senate committee released a report telling Americans that they needed to cut the fat, salt, and cholesterol (meat, butter, and eggs) in their diet right now\u2014or else. Those types of food, the report said, directly link to heart disease, cancer, obesity, and stroke. It cited evidence that scholars at the time, and today, said is flawed. The report drove home the idea that taking control of our diets meant taking control of our health. \u201cFor those who are overweight,\u201d the report said, \u201cthe best protection against heart disease is weight reduction.\u201d\u00a0Later the U.S. surgeon general and the World Health Organization chimed in with their own low-fat reports, every major newspaper and magazine covered the news, and suddenly all over America, fridges were stocked with watery skim milk and margarine. \u201cFrom 1984 through the 1990s, dietary fat was increasingly blamed not only for coronary heart disease but also for [weight gain] and obesity,\u201d writes Ann F. La Berge in the article \u201cHow the Ideology of Low Fat Conquered America.\u201d By swapping your milk, the thinking (but not the evidence) went, you\u2019d reduce your chances of heart disease\u2014and your waistline.From the moment in 1898 J.H. Kellogg introduced Toasted Corn Flakes to get our digestion on track, we\u2019ve looked to food to make us healthier, more virtuous, and thinner. Has it worked? Not really. So why do we keep expecting it to?In response to these reports, the same companies who\u2019d sold us fat, sugar, and salt for decades quickly pivoted to selling such delicacies as Lean Cuisine, Healthy Choice, Stouffer\u2019s Right Course, The Budget Gourmet Slim Selects, Campbell\u2019s Le Menu LightStyle, and Molly McButter (cholesterol-free butter-flavored sprinkles).Jenny Craig launched. Cooking Light magazine debuted. Jane Fonda\u2019s famous workout VHS tapes sold millions. Oprah dragged a Radio Flyer wagon full of animal fat onstage and said, \u201cI\u2019m gonna live on broccoli now.\u201d In a 1983 Glamour magazine survey, 76 percent of women said they were \u201ctoo fat\u201d when 45 percent of those same women were considered underweight. Seventy percent of Playboy playmates were underweight, according to a study that went to the trouble of examining the waist-to-hip ratio in 240 nudie centerfolds. Deaths from eating disorders reached an all-time high. In the \u201980s, writes food scholar Claude Fischler, people \u201cdreamed of being thin, saw themselves as fat, and suffered from the contradiction.\u201dAnd yet! There was no evidence that low-fat Kraft Singles advertised on television by a young Leo DiCaprio made us thinner or healthier. Meanwhile, obesity rates in America shot up for the first time in the \u201980s. Chicken McNuggets made their debut. By 1988 fast-food sales had increased to $60 billion (up from $6 billion in 1970). Portion sizes for what constituted a single serving sharply increased. President Reagan restricted food-stamp eligibility, making it harder for low-income Americans to get affordable fresh food. The health care system became increasingly privatized and Medicaid spending was cut, widening the health disparities between the rich and the poor. My mom\u2014a nurse\u2014was drinking cold Pepsi after cold Pepsi and also smoking Marlboro reds while she was pregnant with me. What I\u2019m saying is: There were other things going on in this country that affected American health more than the food on grocery store shelves.But back to Healthy Choice. The year the brand was founded, 1989, 626 new \u201creduced-fat\u201d products were introduced, up 127 percent from the previous year. Healthy Choice stood out because it wasn\u2019t marketed as a weight-loss solution the way Weight Watchers\u2019 frozen dinners were. The focus was on \u201chealthy.\u201d \u201cListen to your heart,\u201d was the slogan slathered on ads showing svelte grandpas flexing for their grandkids and thin couples canoodling. The ads compared Healthy Choice\u2019s fat, sodium, and cholesterol counts to other brands and \u201creaffirmed notions that health is a personal choice, a lifestyle choice, and that health concerns should be addressed through commodity solutions,\u201d writes S. Bryn Austin in her essay for the book Weighty Issues. In other words: Skip the doctor, head to Safeway! And that mindset has everything to do with where the diet food industry is today.Illustration by John GallDieting is dead. Long live dieting.Somewhere along the line, after the Mediterranean diets of the \u201990s and South Beach and Atkins of the \u201900s, dieting went out of fashion. In 1992 a panel at the National Institutes of Health reported that people on weight-loss diets gain the weight back in five years (though the findings were flawed because the subjects were already chronic dieters). There were women\u2019s magazine stories like \u201cStop Dieting\u2014 And Start Losing Weight\u201d (Redbook, 1996) as well as coverage of the growing \u201csize acceptance\u201d movement. A 1994 issue of Woman\u2019s Day included a chart of \u201cpolitically correct weight-loss terms\u201d: \u201cdiet\u201d was out, \u201chealthful eating\u201d was in; \u201ccalorie counting\u201d was out, \u201cportion control\u201d was in. The chart was credited: Weight Watchers International.Skepticism for diets only grew\u2014in the early \u201990s the Federal Trade Commission charged 17 diet companies with making false and deceptive claims. Intuitive Eating: A Recovery Book for the Chronic Dieter by Evelyn Tribole and Elyse Resch came out in 1995 and guided readers on how to rebuild their body images. But the diet industry simply adapted. Weight-loss pills, low-cal frozen dinners, books, and workout tapes talked about \u201chealthy lifestyles.\u201d The idea of \u201cfunctional foods\u201d took root, which was great news for bran. The FDA passed a food labeling act that allowed companies to put health and nutrition claims like \u201cheart healthy\u201d and \u201csupports immune health\u201d on their products, which marketers ran with. I saw a full-page ad for both prunes and mammograms (beneath a tastefully covered bare breast: \u201chelping prune the risk of cancer every day\u201d). Pharmaceutical companies launched lines of digestive biscuits. By 2001 the diet industry was worth an estimated $34.7 billion.For the first time since it started tracking the diet industry, the market research firm Datamonitor saw a decline in new products with the word diet in the brand name starting in 2005. That same year Coke launched Coke Zero, which is a diet soda like all that came before it but largely marketed to men, as scholar Emily J.H. Contois explains in her book Diners, Dudes, and Diets. The word diet was too intertwined with women\u2019s deprivation diets, which were historically huge bummers, while the word zero implied a lack of bullshit.Dieting kept dying, for the most part. In 2013 the trade publication FoodNavigator-USA wrote that \u201cmarketers are avoiding the word \u2018diet\u2019 like the plague\u201d and quoted an expert who said weight loss had become \u201ca \u2018stealth\u2019 issue.\u201d In 2015 Lean Cuisine\u2019s brand manager at the time told Ad Age \u201cdiets are dead\u201d and the brand deleted all uses of the word diet from its marketing, pivoting to a strategy that emphasized women\u2019s empowerment. (And when that didn\u2019t quite save \u2019em, in 2020 the company introduced a new brand: Life Cuisine.) In 2017 Shape wrote, \u201cThe Anti-Diet Is the Healthiest Diet You Could Ever Be On.\u201d Yet another nail entered the coffin when Weight Watchers changed its name to WW in 2018 to take the emphasis away from weight loss.The word diet may be as pass\u00e9 as a cold can of Tab (discontinued in 2020), but that doesn\u2019t mean the concept has gone flat and stale in the back of the fridge too. In the last few years, \u201cwellness\u201d has come into fashion\u2014hell, Bon App\u00e9tit even had a whole website dedicated to it called Healthyish, which is also the theme of the very magazine issue this story was published in! In the food industry but also in skin care, fashion, fitness, and beyond, the concept of \u201cself-care\u201d cozily slipped in where \u201chealth\u201d once reigned. Wellness wraps up food, mental health, and self-love into one beautifully designed package that can try to disentangle itself from the diet industry but can never quite escape one thing: our body obsession.The path to purityIn the last two weeks, I\u2019ve sampled Cheez-It dupes made from heirloom corn flour, chickpea pasta, pea protein puffs, and cauliflower crust pizza from a brand that made nearly $39 million in 2020, and $35 million in just the first six months of 2021.In the grocery store world, these food products are called \u201cbetter for you\u201d (BFY!) foods, and the BFY snacks market grew to $39 billion in 2020. BFY products are a response to what industry adviser David Portalatin, who writes an annual report called Eating Patterns in America, calls a \u201cpath to purity\u201d\u2014people who are looking for minimal, whole ingredients. Brands like Rxbar emphasize how few ingredients its product has right on the front of the sticky protein bar\u2019s package: three egg whites, six almonds, four cashews, two dates, no B.S. The brand sold to Kellogg\u2019s for $600 million in 2017.\u201cThe change [in the American diet] today is really driven by the fact that consumers want to feel good about what they\u2019re eating,\u201d Portalatin says. It reminded me that two years ago, I wrote a headline for a recipe story: \u201cCook How You Want to Feel,\u201d which haunts me every time I make a frozen pizza. (Sometimes I want to feel like melted cheese, oozing off the couch.)In 2006 Michael Pollan\u2019s seminal book, The Omnivore\u2019s Dilemma, argued that local organic food is good and so-called processed food is bad, very generally speaking. The book explores the ethical, planetary, and cultural cost of industrialized food and was a huge best seller, racking up accolades and even a young readers\u2019 version. It\u2019s arguably shaping a generation of eaters, including farmers-market-loving me. In much of his work, Pollan \u201csets up a moral hierarchy of food,\u201d writes dietitian Christy Harrison in her book Anti-Diet, and it gave some readers even more food anxiety than we already had. Though hardly the first to do so (see Kellogg and masturbation), his influence, along with the seemingly uncontainable wellness industry, has given us another layer under which to cloak diet culture.\u201cWellness\u201d wraps up food, mental health, and self-love into one beautifully designed package that can try to disentangle itself from the diet industry but can never quite escape one thing: our body obsession.Consider the pink can of Strawberry Vanilla Olipop prebiotic tonic on my desk, which includes 32 percent of my daily recommended fiber. That seems like it could have repercussions I\u2019m not ready to face. I show it to Harrison, whom I\u2019m interviewing, over Zoom. \u201cWhat\u2019s in it?\u201d she asks. \u201cBotanicals,\u201d I reply, holding the can to the screen.She laughs. \u201cThis really exemplifies the switch from aboveboard diet culture to wellness diet culture,\u201d she says. In her book, Harrison writes about how the wellness industry seems to be selling overall health, but it can\u2019t exist without making you fear being unhealthy, which most Americans still associate with fatness. The diet culture lurking in food activists like Pollan\u2019s work, she explains, is the underlying idea that the wrong foods will make you fat and that fatness is a national shame. Eating more sustainably farmed food is great and all, but if you\u2019re eating out of self-loathing, fear, and hatred of being fat, it\u2019s still diet culture. And so I drink the Olipop because it tastes delicious, like cream soda, and not because I\u2019m trying to cleanse my colon.In Diners, Dudes, and Diets, Contois posits that the wellness industry really took off during and after the chaos of the 2016 presidential election. When the world outside feels out of control, people seek control over the closest thing in the vicinity: their bodies. The Wellness Diet, Harrison writes in Anti-Diet, \u201cis a type of virtue signaling that people use to secure and maintain their own class status.\u201d The pandemic only magnified the problem. Sales of sleep-aid teas, calming chocolates, and anything labeled \u201cimmune-boosting\u201d skyrocketed. We\u2019re in such a crowded mess of new diet foods that it\u2019s funny to me that the most popular diet last year was old-fashioned deprivation rebranded as intermittent fasting.The Eating Instinct author Virginia Sole-Smith tells me that even though the language has changed, a \u201cbetter for you\u201d food is still a diet food: \u201cIt\u2019s still telling people that there\u2019s a right way to eat and a wrong way to eat and if you\u2019re eating the wrong way, it\u2019s a reflection on you as a person, and your value, and your body. And it\u2019s still selling weight loss.\"Big food fights backSo what\u2019s Healthy Choice doing now? To find out I\u2019m having lunch at the headquarters of its parent company, ConAgra, in Chicago\u2019s Merchandise Mart. Specifically, I\u2019m here for the Healthy Choice Power Bowls. Bob Nolan, my dining companion, is head of Demand Science, a job I understand to mean \u201cfigure out what consumers want before they even know they want it.\u201d We have a tasting menu of their newest dishes, microwaved and plated in airplane-size square bowls and garnished with a little parsley. They\u2019ve printed a menu that says \u201cWelcome Bon App\u00e9tit!\u201d and there are flowers on the table.\u201cTo become a national way of life, weight control had to be built into the culture as if it had always been there,\u201d writes historian Hillel Schwartz in Never Satisfied: A Cultural History of Diets, Fantasies and Fat. \u201cDiet food had to seem to be basic food.\u201d Prebiotic sodas, bags of LesserEvil avocado-oil air-popped popcorn (love the stuff ), all seem like snacks to me at this point, but something deep down, or not so deep down anymore, knows they\u2019re tugging at my anxiety over eating my one true love: kettle chips.\u00a0This is just lunch food, the Healthy Choice bowls say, there\u2019s nothing diet about it. But a calorie count on the front of the box, the callout of \u201clow carb lifestyle,\u201d and a yellow flag that shouts \u201cmade with riced cauliflower!\u201d or \u201c8g net carbs\u201d signals to customers that it\u2019s healthy, and healthy food will keep you thin. My favorite is the Cuban-style pork power bowl, with sweet bites of plantains.Nolan is an industry legend who helped bring Healthy Choice (among other brands) out of the red by completely scrapping the old way of making brand decisions and embracing data instead. Frozen food sales, not just the sad diet ones, were lagging for decades because, while the brand led the way by marketing \u201chealth\u201d over weight loss, the food tasted terrible. By revamping the food and the format\u2014power bowls, baby!\u2014Nolan brought Healthy Choice back to the top of the frozen food charts. His team uses data from credit cards, Google searches, and grocery store rewards cards (the places where consumers never lie) to determine what new flavors and diets they\u2019ll target in different bowls.The words on food packages are so important you can put a dollar value on them. Gluten-free is an $87 billion industry. Protein is $26.8 billion. Oat milk: $37 billion. By making a dish that appeals to each specific category\u2014Nolan calls these \u201cjobs\u201d\u2014the brand can make a lot of money. \u201cPlant-based,\u201d Nolan tells me, is the biggest area of growth right now, despite the fact that Americans\u2019 vegetable consumption continues to decline.\u00a0The truth is, the top \u201cjob\u201d customers are \u201chiring\u201d Healthy Choice to perform when they buy most of the dishes is losing a few pounds. From there Healthy Choice has a meal for every diet that might (but probably won\u2019t) get you there, whether you\u2019re keto or vegan or on a 30-day sugar challenge. For that last one, have a sesame chicken and zoodle Zero bowl\u2014even the O in \u201czero\u201d is skinny!Food companies are responding to the demands of the marketplace, and those demands reflect all of our inner demons: body insecurity, food guilt, wanting to be a \u201cbetter\u201d person, a willingness to trade off flavor for perceived nutrition, never-ending confusion over what \u201chealthy\u201d even means, feelings of utter lack of control in a chaotic world, fear of death. So we end up volleying these anxieties back and forth at each other from behind the frosted freezer doors.\u00a0NPD Group\u2019s David Portalatin thinks the next big movement in the diet food space will be personalization, which we\u2019ve already seen in the beauty industry (I took a \u201chair quiz\u201d and tried personalized shampoo once; it had nothing on Head & Shoulders). Who am I kidding, I would probably buy a personalized meal delivery kit based on my sun, moon, and rising signs. It\u2019ll all be fun, and make people money, and still not keep you from dying.You aren\u2019t what you eatI set out to figure out whether these \u201cbetter for you\u201d foods were making us healthier, but all I could prove is that they\u2019re still selling. The diet\u2014sorry, \u201chealth\u201d\u2014food industry is cranking along, thanks to internalized biases that equate health with thinness, a long cultural history of body obsession, and fantastic marketing. Meanwhile, the people propping up the industry (generally white, middle- and upper-middle class) are the least likely to be in poor health. \u201cRather than spending so much time fretting over what to buy at the supermarket,\u201d Eating Anxiety author Chad Lavin told me, \u201cI wish we spent more time as a culture fretting about making sure people had health care.\u201d\u00a0By the way, did you know that our diet and physical activity really only contribute a small portion of our overall health outcomes? There are so many other major factors, most of which are out of our control, that determine what happens to our bodies. \u201cDiet matters, but it does not matter in the way that most people think,\u201d Harvard\u2019s Fatima Stanford, M.D., told me, standing in front of a fake leafy background on Zoom. To illustrate this point she shared her screen with me to show a slide from a presentation about the complexity of obesity.\u00a0Some of the factors in her color-coded chart were: Prescription drugs. Sleep deficit. Portion sizes. Trauma history. Hormone fluctuation. Age. Gut microbiota. Maternal stress. Weight cycling (yes, losing weight causes weight gain). Family conflict. Lack of health care provider support. Heightened hunger responses. Delayed satiety. Gestational diabetes. Thermogenesis. Weight stigma.\u201cRather than spending so much time fretting over what to buy at the supermarket,\u201d Lavin told me, \u201cI wish we spent more time as a culture fretting about making sure people had health care.\u201dThe last one there is so crucial. Studies have found that weight stigma\u2014being bullied, shamed, and ostracized for being fat (by others, and by one\u2019s self)\u2014in fact causes weight gain and is just as damaging to health as \u201cpoor diet.\u201d I\u2019m really just scratching the surface here, but almost every diet expert I talked to agreed on one thing: Americans need to stop giving food so much power. \u201cFood should really just be such a small part of our lives,\u201d says Christy Harrison. \u201cIt\u2019s essential for living, but in a way it\u2019s like breathing or going to the bathroom. We all have to do it, but there\u2019s so much more to life.\u201d For those of us who work at food magazines or love to cook, food is one of life\u2019s greatest pleasures. Don\u2019t get bogged down in the net carb count. Get your basic nutrients; have a little fun while you\u2019re at it.As Diet Coke hits the ripe old age of 40, Coke Zero is now projected to be the company\u2019s biggest source of growth. It\u2019s basically the same drink, just with a slightly different blend of artificial sweeteners, and I can say with confidence that it tastes great. I\u2019ll never get tired of that sweet, sparkly taste of nothing. And I\u2019m not the only one.Explore Bon App\u00e9titCultureessayLifestyleRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
