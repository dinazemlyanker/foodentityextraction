I had what felt like a bazillion more recipes to test when it happened. But honestly, I wasn\u2019t even upset to see it go. My old Chef Master was never a particularly great appliance. It was at least 20 years old, wildly inconsistent in the temperature department, and heated up the whole apartment in no time flat. As a renter, I didn\u2019t have much choice in its replacement\u2014or how quickly (or not) it would come. But luckily, I did have a little ace up my sleeve.At first glance, the Breville Smart Oven doesn\u2019t look like more than a larger-than-average toaster oven. But don\u2019t let its small stature and cute twisty knobs belie its power and functionality. This little appliance got me through that stressful, flour-dusted time, baking approximately one million cakes, one after another, for a couple months straight, all at a very consistent 350\u00baF. But it wasn\u2019t just that trial that earned this countertop oven\u2019s permanent place in my heart, and on my counter. And right now, it\u2019s proving more clutch than ever.I\u2019ve used it for toasting a handful of nuts (which saves more energy than if I used a regular oven!). Cooking a whole chicken (the convection setting, which even many full-size models lack, makes the skin extra crispy and the roasted veggies super caramelized!). Making finicky meringues (so much temperature precision!). It\u2019s just the right size for a personal pan of nachos, but big enough to accommodate a 9x13 dish of your favorite comfort casserole or a quarter sheet pan of focaccia. It goes up to 450\u00baF, and you can broil to your heart\u2019s content. Plus, it\u2019s got a bunch of settings for heating specific foods like pizza and bagels and toast (six slices at a time!)\u2014and one for leftovers, too.This focaccia could be yours\u2026\nThese days, though, my favorite use for this countertop oven is pretty simple. Just about every night, I\u2019ll bake off a couple of fresh chocolate chip cookies from the stash of dough in my freezer, so my boyfriend and I can enjoy a warm cookie on the couch without turning on the full-size oven (yes, we finally got a new one) or heating up the entire apartment.Is it pricey for a countertop appliance? Definitely. But if you have the room in your kitchen and the space in your budget, you might like having one of these around\u2014whether you absolutely love your full-size oven, or not.Breville Smart Oven Pro$525 $280 at Sur La Table$280 at Bloomingdales'sYossy Arefi is a food photographer, food stylist, former professional baker, and the creator of the blog Apt. 2B Baking Co.
