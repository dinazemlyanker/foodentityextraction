Edge piece or center cut? Lunch dessert or dinner dessert (why not both)? But the query I\u2019m writing about today may be the most important of all because it determines how those future desserts will fare. And that question is: Is it better to bake in glass or metal?Whether you\u2019re adding to your bakeware collection or looking to upgrade what you already own, you\u2019ll want to know which material is better for your future brownies, lemon bars, and sheet cakes. So we asked a few of the best bakers in the biz what they prefer. And almost unanimously they said metal. It\u2019s lightweight, easy to maintain, and inexpensive, and it provides a more consistent and even bake.A very good baking pan:Nordic Ware Classic Metal 9x13 Covered Cake Pan$13 at Amazon$22 at Nordic WareIn Edd Kimber\u2019s new book One Tin Bakes, he calls for one pan and one pan only (hence the title): a 9x13\" pan with sides at least 2\" high in natural (a.k.a. uncoated) aluminum. Edd deems the aluminum pan (his favorite brand is Nordic Ware) the \u201cMVP of bakeware. It\u2019s relatively cheap, doesn\u2019t have nonstick coatings to worry about scratching, and, if looked after properly, will last a very long time. Aluminum is a very good heat conductor, which means baked goods will brown evenly, and it doesn\u2019t rust.\u201dGlass bakeware, in comparison, is heavier than aluminum and more expensive. Because glass is an insulator, rather than a conductor, it\u2019s slow to heat but, once hot, retains that heat for longer. This can result in uneven baking: By the time the interior is baked through, the exterior is often overcooked, dry, or dark. (Some bakers even recommend lowering the oven temperature by 25\u00b0 when baking in glass to combat this problem.)But those aren\u2019t the only reasons to go with metal. Yossy Arefi, who baked hundreds of cakes for her newest book Snacking Cakes, is also in it for the neat corners. \u201cMy square and rectangular metal bakeware have crisp 90-degree corners,\u201d Yossy says. \u201cIt's purely aesthetic, but I find those straight lines very satisfying.\u201d Metal pans are also practically indestructible, which is essential in Yossy\u2019s small kitchen.The MVP in action.\nPhoto by Chelsie Craig, Food Styling by Kat BoytsovaAluminum is good for cakes, bars, and pies\u2014but also for breads: focaccia, sandwich loaves, and rolls. \u00a0Because metal heats up faster than glass, it contributes to a better rise and crisper, browner edges. But whatever you're baking, it's important to remember that not every metal pan is a great metal pan. Vallery Lomas, champion of season 3 of The Great American Baking Show notes that \u201cfinish, material, and quality matter\u2014especially if you don't want the bottoms of your baked goods overdone.\u201d If your pans are too dark, they\u2019ll absorb more heat, which, like glass, can cause the exterior to bake too quickly.So what is the one exception to the metal-or-bust rule? Pie\u2014for beginners. \u201cThe ONLY thing I like about glass is that you can see through it,\u201d explains Erin McDowell, pie whisperer and author of the The Book on Pie. \u201cThis is mostly helpful for beginners who tend to not realize how long pies really need to bake. Being able to \u2018check\u2019 that bottom crust can be really helpful for those just starting out, to get comfortable with the visual cues.\u201d Otherwise, though, Erin prefers metal. \u201c[Metal] is the most nonstick, which is hard not to love, and does the best job of conducting heat.\u201dA very good baking dish:Pyrex Basics 3 Quart Glass Oblong Baking Dish$25 at AmazonSave your glass pans for lasagna, pl\u00e1tanos maduros horneados, baked eggs, pi\u00f1on, casseroles, and doughnut bread pudding\u2014they\u2019re easy to clean, they\u2019re so smooth they\u2019re naturally nonstick, they\u2019ll keep your kugel warm as it sits on the table, they won\u2019t cause discoloration or off-tastes when you\u2019re slow-roasting tomatoes or other acidic foods. But metal will handle the baked goods.Your glass dish wants to be full of kugel.\nPhoto by Chelsie Craig, Food Styling by Yekaterina BoytsovaAnd should you panic and forget everything you\u2019ve learned, just hang onto this handy rule of thumb from our recipe editor Liesel Davis: If a recipe calls for a \u201cdish,\u201d that typically means glass or ceramic; if it calls for a \u201cpan\u201d or \u201ctin,\u201d go with metal.Explore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingRecipes you want to make.
