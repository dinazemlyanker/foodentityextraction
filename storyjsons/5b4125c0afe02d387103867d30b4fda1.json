I\u2019m exhausted by what\u2019s already happened and afraid of what\u2019s next. I\u2019m burned out on constant news alerts and talking heads, but I can\u2019t turn away from the screen. Sometimes I catch myself thinking, \u201cWhen will this shit be over?\u201d Then I remember that Brett Kavanaugh is not just a bad dream we\u2019ll wake up from. Dr. Christine Blasey Ford isn\u2019t the first woman in America to be sexually assaulted. And the hardest fights are still to come.We all know too many women like Ford, who\u2019ve survived by being quiet and following the rules. We all know too many guys like Kavanaugh who\u2019ve escaped responsibility by being privileged and loud. I\u2019ve talked with nearly all my female and non-binary friends about this and about the state of our mental health right now. But I realized, toward the end of last week, that I hadn\u2019t been talking to men, and I wanted to be. I don\u2019t mean flagging down men on the street and handing out primers on the patriarchy. I mean talking to my partner and my male friends, the men I know who \u201cget it\u201d and are also horrified by what\u2019s happening right now. I wanted to hear their support, and I wanted to know that they understood.When I saw this GQ post last week, I was grateful to Marian Bull for writing it, and I wished there were something similar for people like me, people who want to ask men\u2014or anyone in their lives\u2014to show up for them right now. How do I convey what it feels like to be so triggered, exhausted, and scared? How do I simply ask for support? How do I have the conversations I want to have and not the ones I don\u2019t? Below are some strategies that I\u2019ve found helpful these past few days. I\u2019m thinking of it like my mantra for the next week and beyond.I don\u2019t have to say anythingFirst thing\u2019s first: I don\u2019t owe anyone a lesson in feminism, the patriarchy, or basic human decency. It\u2019s not my job to turn every guy in the world into an enlightened ally, because that gets exhausting fast. I have to decide who\u2019s worth my time, and it\u2019s probably the people I love and care about the most.I'm talking about how I\u2019m doingYes, men should be checking in with the women they care about right now. But I don\u2019t have to wait for that \u201cHow are you?\u201d text to come through. A couple ways I\u2019ve been practicing reaching out: \u201cI could really use a reminder that guys aren\u2019t all terrible. Want to take a walk later?\u201d or \u201cAll this white male rage is really getting me down. Can we just get takeout tonight?\u201d The responses I get tell me what I need to know about whether this person is ready to be an ally.I'm sending people stuff to readEven if the guys in my life are glued-to-Axios politics nerds, they may not be reading the same articles, Tweets, podcasts, etc. as I am, and that can make it feel like we\u2019re on entirely different wavelengths. Andrew Sullivan is smart and all, but have they read Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw, Noreen Malone, or Rebecca Traister? It\u2019s good to talk about how this Supreme Court appointment will affect U.S. law and policy, but do they understand how this process is affecting women\u2019s bodies and minds right now? I\u2019ve been sending links to my male friends along with some follow-up thoughts: \u201cMalone really nails the problem of inherited privilege here, don\u2019t you think?\u201dI'm asking for what I wantThere\u2019s no one-size-fits-all way for men to support women right now, because women are not one-size-fits all. I\u2019m thinking about what I want from the men in my life. Many women have been taught for so long to not ask men for things, and so we have no idea where to start with this. So that\u2019s step one: Figuring out what I need. And every answer is valid. Maybe it\u2019s important that my best guy friend call me more regularly to check in. Maybe I want my other friend to use his sizeable Twitter following to speak out against the bullshit. Maybe I want my dad to donate to the national sexual assault hotline or another organization that supports victims of sexual abuse. Next step: Telling them.I'm asking for quietSometimes I just don\u2019t want to hear guys talk. It doesn\u2019t matter whether I agree with them or not. When this whole situation feels like one big trigger factory, when I\u2019m tired of men raging on all sides of the political spectrum, it\u2019s okay to ask for some quiet. When it comes to silence, there's the kind that feels like a cop-out and there's the kind that feels like listening. I'm looking for the second one.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishSelf CareRead MorecultureWhy We Learned to FightBy Zan RomanoffRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
