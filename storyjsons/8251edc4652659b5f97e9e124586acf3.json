For $2.99, I got a bag of 20 dumplings that were always dependably salty and juicy, stuffed with pork and cabbage and seasoned with green onion, garlic, and ginger. They got me through countless meals during my twenties, and over the years, I perfected my pan-frying method, fanning out the dumplings in a nonstick skillet with a couple tablespoons of water and a small slick of oil, then covering them with a lid so they would steam-fry over medium-high heat until the bottoms were browned and crisp. Dipped in a mix of soy sauce and sweet rice vinegar, they were my cure-all for colds, hangovers, break-ups, days playing hooky from the job I hated so much.A bag full of porky, juicy goodness\nPhoto by Emma FishmanI stopped making my six-mile round trip to Trader Joe\u2019s years ago, and these days I\u2019m more likely to make my own dumplings. But the other week I passed by the TJ\u2019s in Union Square and decided to pop in on a whim. While everyone else was elbowing each other over the last bags of\u2014what else?\u2014Cauliflower Gnocchi, I made out with a couple of bags of frozen gyoza. I took them home, fried them until crisp, dipped them in soy sauce and vinegar\u2014and they were every bit as delicious as I remembered.Get them: Trader Joe\u2019s stores nationwideExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendTrader Joe'sShoppingRead MorecultureTrader Joe\u2019s Oat Milk, and More New Winter Stuff, ReviewedBy Alex BeggsRecipes you want to make.
