Okay, maybe that\u2019s a bit drastic, but the sweet season four premiere of the popular Netflix documentary series has been replaying in my head all weekend. And I don\u2019t even really like cake.Turns out, neither does Tosi. \u201cCake is the thing you\u2019re raised as a child in America to be the most exciting, celebratory dessert you can have, and\u2026 it was just okay,\u201d she reveals on Chef\u2019s Table. \u201cIt\u2019s spongy, there\u2019s not that much flavor, it\u2019s usually a little dry, there\u2019s not a lot of texture. Just a world of missed opportunities.\u201dThat lukewarm feeling about cake is what inspired her to redefine her relationship with the dessert and create Milk Bar\u2019s iconic layered birthday cake. It is intricately stacked with layers of confetti cake, crunchy cake crumbs, frosting, and extra sprinkles, but has one major difference from the cakes you probably grew up eating.More layers than Shrek\u2019s personality.\nNetflix\u201cFrom being in culinary school around all these insane masters of beauty and perfection when it comes to finishing a cake, they had tired me out completely to the point where I was like, \u2018I don\u2019t think cake should be frosted,\u2019\u201d Tosi explains in the clip below. \u201cI\u2019ve seen how obsessed you can get with frosting a cake, and that time should be spent elsewhere ... we\u2019re not in pottery class.\u201dContentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Ultimately, it\u2019s what\u2019s inside that counts, and giving customers that \u201cdollhouse moment of looking in and seeing the world of amazing things happening inside.\u201d  Tosi wants everyone to see the little intricacies of how she\u2018s thinking about your perfect layer cake. \u201cSo we don\u2019t frost the sides of cake. That\u2019s my diatribe on cake,\u201d she concludes.Slice, slice, baby.\nNetflixElsewhere in Tosi\u2019s Chef\u2019s Table episode, she explains the \u201cunderground\u201d origins of Crack Pie (which you can find the recipe for here), how cereal milk ice cream was conceived in the back of a 24-hour bodega, and more desserts that make her a \u201cuniquely American chef\u201d (in the words of Bon App\u00e9tit\u2019s own editor at large Christine Muhlke). \u201cShe\u2019s not trying to be French, she\u2019s not running off to Japan. She is America, and America\u2019s delicious.\u201dNow, excuse me\u2014is it anyone\u2019s birthday out there? I could use an excuse to eat this cake, candles optional.Get the recipe:Momofuku Milk Bar\u2019s Birthday Layer CakeView RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titChristina TosiMomofuku Milk BarNetflixCakeDessertRead MorepromotionsCookies, Cake Balls, and Puppies!
