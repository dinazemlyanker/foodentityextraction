This is one of my favorites - easy and chock full of flavor. I\u2019ve made it with proper Aleppo-style pepper and with substitutes (e.g., paprika and cayenne) and I think the Aleppo makes a difference (order from Penzey\u2019s if not readily available where you are). Ditto the fennel fronds if you have them. Tried many different mushrooms and it doesn\u2019t really matter too much which you use but a mix is nice. AnonymousSeattle, Washington 3/11/2022WOW!!!  Lucky to have a half lb of ground lamb in the freezer and came across this.  Roasted 2 small potatoes other than that followed directions exactly which is rare for me.  I was questioning how this would come together but OMG!!  So much flavor, easy, delicious will be made again and again.  Very excited about this one. <3 Auggie Milford, MAA6/23/2021Fabulous recipe and actually doable in the 30 minutes it claims. Took the suggestion of another poster and added grated cucumber to the yoghurt, like a raita. Only had Cremini  mushrooms but they crisped up beautifully in the lamb fat - don\u2019t drain that off!! Definitely something we will keep on rotationJoanna Horobin12/1/2020This is a wonderful recipe. I did not think I was a big fan of sweet potatoes until I made this. Still haven\u2019t had the chance to make it with lamb, but I plan to do so soon. Tonight I plan to make it with leftover shredded beef. This recipe is very versatile in my opinion. AnonymousChattanooga, TN8/10/2020 This is my second time making this wonderful, fragrant, savory, dish. Love, love, love it! Eventually I hope to find some actual ground lamb, rather than hamburger! The quest for all the interesting ingredients in this dish took a while to pull together: Aleppo style pepper, fresh fennel,the lamb! The mint I had in my garden. I would like to try making my own Garam Masala too! Thank you, BA!AnonymousCary, NC6/28/2020This was great!   I doubled the recipe, skinned the sweet potato and cut it into smaller portions so it would steam a bit faster.  I used labneh for the yogurt (personal preference) and added some Aleppo pepper to the lamb - that with cumin and cinnamon was delicious.  My lamb rendered A LOT of fat, much of which I spooned out before added the mushrooms, which never got particularly golden but still tasted great.  The yogurt sauce kind of melts into the sweet potato when it's hot, and the pickled fennel adds a nice crunch with acidity.  I didn't have onion or mint, next time I'll do onion instead of fennel, and I think the mint would set it off nicely.AnonymousOakland, CA4/12/2020Delicious! Complex flavours which all go so well together. Used cumin/cinnamon combo and didn\u2019t change a thing. Will make again and again.AnonymousVancouver4/6/2020100% agree with the previous comment. This is 10/10. I have made it so many times, actually planning to make it for my daughter's 2nd birthday dinner!AnonymousChicago10/18/2019THIS RECIPE RULES. Why is this not getting as much love as the Mushroom Carbonara??? Y'all get on this spiced-lamb train and take it all the way to the end of the line because it is perfect. I do not live in a metropolitan center and therefore my grocery did not carry garam masala (sad) so I used a combo cardamom/cinnamon/cumin & it was DELISH. Plus I threw some shaved cucumbers/mint into the yogurt. One more time, this recipe is the bomb.com. (The printed recipe says garam masala, this one says cumin/cinnamon, my personal thought is that any spice here is a great spice.)AnonymousVirginia8/26/2019Explore Bon App\u00e9titRice and Grain BowlSweet PotatoPotatoVegetableGround LambLambMeatChanterelle MushroomMushroomShiitake MushroomOyster MushroomPorcini MushroomEasyWeeknight MealsMainGluten-FreeNut-FreeHealthyishSaut\u00e9DinnerRecipes you want to make.
