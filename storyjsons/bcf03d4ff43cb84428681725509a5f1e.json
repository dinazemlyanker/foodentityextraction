Yes, the bar plays big matches on the huge screen behind the horseshoe-shaped bar, but unlike most sports pubs, that\u2019s the only TV (and their nachos are legitimately good).ORDER THE: craft beer of your choice from their predominantly Canadian list (ask for something from Persephone or Dieu du Ciel; nachos grande, which easily makes for a saucy, meaty, cheesy meal for two; one of their half-dozen burgers served on a milk bun; and a marshmallows- and sprinkles-crowned soft-serve sundae.THE VIBE IS: noisy and casual, all the makings of a reliably good time. In addition to all the sporting events, there\u2019s often live music and a games area in back (Skee-Ball!). Hot tip: There\u2019s also a seating area entirely separate from the big screen.PRACTICAL STUFF: Open every day, from 11:30 a.m. to midnight, with weekend brunch served Saturday and Sunday, from 11:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. No reservations.\u2014Lindsay AndersonGrant HarderGrant HarderWE ALSO LOVEGrapes & SodaKitsilano\u2019s blink-and-you\u2019ll-miss-it destination for cocktails and natural wine Explore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
