However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.\u201cIf you ask chefs what we use in our homes, most of us probably didn\u2019t buy the pre-seasoned wok from a fancy kitchen store for $100,\u201d says Melissa Miranda, chef-owner of Musang in Seattle. Miranda\u2019s own wok, a traditional carbon steel workhorse, stars alongside her in her Bon App\u00e9tit video for adobong pusit pancit (a Filipino noodle dish with squid and adobo). In the video, Miranda uses her wok to cook the alliums that serve as the base for the dish before adding the diced tomatoes, squid, fish stock, and adobo sauce in quick succession. \u201cIt\u2019s super important to have all your mise ready because you can see it\u2019s already starting to cook,\u201d Miranda says. She then adds the noodles to the wok, which soak up the deliciously saucy base of the adobong pusit pancit, and gives the dish a very impressive flip or two to combine.Years of use and care have given Miranda\u2019s wok a rich patina of seasoning that acts like a nonstick finish, and its carbon-steel construction allows the chef to use stainless-steel tongs and spatulas without a second thought. \u201cI remember growing up, my mom ended up buying a nonstick wok and it got ruined,\u201d she says. \u201cIf she used tongs it scraped up the bottom\u2014whereas this one, it can take a beating.\u201dIt\u2019s clear why carbon steel is a staple material for professional chefs: It\u2019s lightweight, durable, comes up to temp in a flash, and becomes naturally nonstick with use. For all of the attributes that endear the material to the pros, Miranda thinks it\u2019s suited to the enthusiastic home cook too. \u201cWhen you\u2019re talking about Asian cuisines, you want that kind of char or smoky high-heat sear that you can\u2019t really get when you're waiting for stainless steel to heat up.\u201dCarbon-steel woks excel at stir-fries (\u201cThe beauty of fast cooking at a high heat means you can\u2019t overcook the vegetables,\u201d she says), but Miranda also uses hers for everything from saut\u00e9s to fried rice and noodle dishes. \u201cMy team makes fun of me, but I\u2019ll actually make pasta dishes in my wok,\u201d she says. \u201cIt helps to have a large enough surface to really get that integration of the sauce and noodles, which release their gluten and starches into the liquid and make the dish more creamy.\u201dCraft Wok Carbon Steel Wok$60 at AmazonWoks are offered with either a flat bottom, which allows them to sit atop a stovetop\u2019s burner grate like any other pot or pan, or a round bottom, which requires a wok ring to help position the wok as close to the heat source as possible. Aside from the \u201crounded versus flat\u201d and \u201ccarbon steel versus nonstick\u201d choices to make while you shop, the last consideration is whether to season your wok yourself or buy one pre-seasoned.While some may prefer the ease of a pre-seasoned wok, Miranda is all for embarking on the seasoning journey yourself. \u201cSeasoning is part of the story of the wok,\u201d she says. Because carbon steel is vulnerable to rust, you must ensure your wok is bone-dry before storing. Miranda dries hers over a stovetop burner and reseasons it with a coat of cooking oil spray. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like cast iron in that way,\u201d she says.While Miranda sourced her go-to wok\u2014it\u2019s one in a rotation of several the chef uses in the kitchen at Musang\u2014from a restaurant supply store, the online outpost of San Francisco\u2019s Wok Shop is another reliable source for woks and their accessories. Miranda also recommends in-person shopping: \u201cYou can go to Asian markets or walk around Chinatown. They have such beautiful, beautiful pans. It takes a little bit of extra elbow grease and love to cook with an unseasoned carbon-steel wok, but it will last a lifetime.\u201dExplore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingRecipes you want to make.
