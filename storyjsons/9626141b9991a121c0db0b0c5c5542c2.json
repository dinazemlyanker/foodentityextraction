I put the steak on a bed of arugula and served with the yogurt and relish -- delicious! Complex flavors, with perfect balance. Thank you.AnonymousSeattle, WA7/6/2021I made this for simple roasted cauliflower, and I was very impressed with the depth of flavor components here. Will definitely make it again. Personal Chef JaneTucson, AZ2/7/2021Very good! I\u2019ll used it over rice, & maybe riced cauliflower.  Easy to make, looks great.  The photo looks like coconut chips instead of dried coconut flakes. Maybe I\u2019ll try that... it looks better!  And salt enhances the flavor.\nSubstituted a jalape\u00f1o plus a little chipotle powder after seeing how hot a Fresno is!  Anonymous11/17/2020Delicious! I doubled the recipe with 3 Tbsp. ghee and used jalape\u00f1o and a little chipotle powder instead of Fresno pepper after reading how hot the Fresno is!  I\u2019m going to try it on plain Greek yogurt as a crudit\u00e9s dip. Love the flavor & crunch.Anonymous11/17/2020Holy cow, this stuff is addictive--next time I will make a double batch.
