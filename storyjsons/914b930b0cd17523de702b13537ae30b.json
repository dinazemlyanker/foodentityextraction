It\u2019ll be nothing but lumpy apples this fall for us (until citrus season), so we\u2019re doing our best to include peak summer fruit in each and every meal. Cocktails are a meal, right?While you could just invert a bottle of vodka into a watermelon and call it a day, there are other ways to incorporate fruit into mixed drinks. We consulted cocktail experts T. Andrew Hunter, tasting room manager at One Eight Distilling in Washington, D.C., and Christina Basham, founder of Bubbles + Agave in Columbus, Ohio, on three techniques to let summer fruit shine: muddling, syrups, and shrubs.But first...are you Team Raw or Team Caramelized?Before picking your technique, decide if you\u2019re starting with raw or cooked fruit. To capture the cleanest essence of summer, keep it raw. \u201cRipe fruits are fresh and bright, even tart if you\u2019re using something like a plum,\u201d says Basham, who recommends adding raw fruits to low-ABV patio-crushers and aperitifs so they won\u2019t be overshadowed by aged high-proof spirits. Consider pairing a raw fruit shrub with a botanical gin or muddled raw fruit with a lighter fortified wine like Manzanilla sherry.This tequila, agave, and pineapple tepache highball will put you right on the beach.\nAlex LauHowever, if you want more complexity, roast your fruit or throw it on the grill. Heat will caramelize the sugars, introducing toffee notes that play well with brown spirits like bourbon and cognac. Grilling will also add a smoky dimension, a perfect complement to mezcal and scotch. \u201cCaramelized fruits will give you those rich, deep sugar flavors,\u201d Basham explains. \u201cYou\u2019re probably not going to kick off your evening with a cocktail made with a grilled fruit syrup, but it\u2019ll make a great nightcap.\u201dNow pick your technique:Muddle ItThe technique: If you have a wooden spoon and 10 seconds, you can muddle. Muddling, which just means smooshing fruit in the bottom of a glass until its juices are released, is the easiest way to incorporate fruit into a cocktail, but your result will only be as good as your raw materials. While you can compensate for underripe or lackluster fruit in a syrup or a shrub, muddled fruit has nowhere to hide. So choose your produce wisely.Use it: Try muddling grilled pineapple with aged rum and coconut milk or juicy blackberries with mint, then top with vodka, lime, and ginger beer.Syrup ItThe technique: Infusing a sugar syrup with fruit is not only a way to add summer flavor to cocktails, but also an age-old method for extending the season. \u201cThe sugar in a syrup is a preserving agent, just like it is in jams and jellies,\u201d Basham says. \u201cIf you're doing a classic 1-to-1 sugar-to-liquid ratio, that\u2019ll last for 30 days in the fridge. But if you make a rich simple syrup, which has a 2-to-1 sugar-to-liquid ratio, you\u2019ll get three months out of it.\u201dThere are a couple ways to turn your summer fruit into syrup:Simmer the fruit: The fastest way to make a fruit syrup is by throwing chopped-up fruit in a saucepan with sugar and water, cooking until the fruit infuses the syrup and then straining.Shower the fruit with sugar and let it sit in the fridge: But Hunter often prefers using a cold-process method to retain the brightness of the fruit\u2014think of the difference in flavor between a roasted strawberry galette and a diner-style strawberry pie with a no-bake gelatin filling. \u201cWhen you cook fruit,\u201d he explains, \u201cyou get more stewed, vegetal, almost grassy flavors. So for something like watermelon, where I want that freshness to come through, I won\u2019t apply heat.\u201d Instead, he adds a cup of sugar to two cups of cubed watermelon and lets it macerate in the fridge for a couple of days. Then he pur\u00e9es the melon and its sugary juices, strains it, and combines it with premade simple syrup.Pro tip! Switch up your sweetener: Basham likes to layer additional flavors into her syrups by using different types of sweeteners. \u201cPlay around with brown sugar, raw sugar, maple, and honey,\u201d she advises.Use it: Top fruit syrups with seltzer and something boozy, or use them in place of sweeteners in most highballs or classic cocktails. For a seasonal back-porch version of an old-fashioned, Basham \u201cwould absolutely do a basil and peach syrup\u2014either raw or roasted\u2014with a honey base.\u201d Meanwhile, Hunter\u2019s summer go-to is a watermelon syrup margarita garnished with a sprig of basil.Shrub ItThe technique: Shrubs combine the preservative powers of both sugar and acid to create a fruity drinking vinegar that will stretch through the fall. \u201cLate-season peaches are perfect for shrubbing,\u201d\u2014Hunter says. \u201cAnd since that shrub will last me deep into November, I\u2019ll pair them with autumnal flavors\u2014cinnamon, clove, apple cider vinegar.\u201dSummer fruit is made for shrubbing.\nPhoto by Michelle HeimermanTo make a shrub, macerate fruit with sugar, then add your vinegar of choice. A plum shrub would sub in nicely for the hibiscus in this low-ABV vermouth cocktail or, Hunter suggests, as a replacement for the citrus and simple syrup in a New York sour. \u201cBut free yourself up to experiment,\u201d he urges. \u201cDon\u2019t use the perfect expensive fruit. These are old techniques born of the need to preserve produce that\u2019s on the brink of going bad. The bruised fruit that\u2019s left over at the end of the farmers market\u2014that\u2019s what you want. It won\u2019t cost you an arm and a leg so you can play around and experiment.\u201dUse it: Basham agrees that a shrub is a September peach\u2019s highest calling. \u201cEspecially as they get overripe, all that liquid is ready to leach out of the fruit,\u201d she enthuses. She likes using shrubs in highballs with vodka, gin, or blanco tequila. \u201cThey act as both a sweetener and an acid, so you don\u2019t have to add citrus.\u201dExplore Bon App\u00e9titFruitCocktailSummerRead Morecooking4 Easy Tequila (and Mezcal!)
