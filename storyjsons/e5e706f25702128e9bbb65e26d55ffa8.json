Spaces matter. And more and more, we want our spaces, the places we spend our downtime in, the dining room we fill our friends with, and the kitchen we make a mess in, to reflect who we are, to spark inspiration. To this end, we hack and we DIY and we mix metals to create a custom, personal look.Melissa ColemanRestaurants and caf\u00e9s do this, too. Beautifully. They create these spaces that make us pull out our phones in hopes of memorizing the clean lines against the warm woods and the collected vintage fixtures. They create these spaces that draw us back for another meal. And another. Sure, the food is good. But there\u2019s something about the space that matters, too.Melissa ColemanAs you create a kitchen inspired by your favorite caf\u00e9, you\u2019ll soon find you can customize just about everything, down to the toe kick. It\u2019s the best part about kitchen design. It\u2019s also the worst part. Too many options can feel overwhelming. That is until you get to that one spot in the kitchen that you can\u2019t customize, the appliances, and the needle runs off the record. Can you hear it? Well, put the needle back on and press play, because personalized appliances are now available for the home kitchen. The brand: Caf\u00e9. The line: Matte Collection.And the people rejoiced before saying\u2014What took so long? Who cares! They\u2019re here, and they\u2019re beautiful. Now, decisions, decisions. Matte White or Matte Black? I\u2019d pick white. Brushed Copper knobs, Brushed Bronze, Brushed Stainless Steel, or Brushed Black? I\u2019d pick copper. Prefer a different vibe? We can agree to disagree because, honey, you can have your Matte Black and Brushed Bronze range and cook in it too. This high-performance line extends from the fridge to the range to the wall ovens, dishwashers, and even microwaves, with customization available for each.It\u2019s true; there is something special about spaces. They\u2019re like mirrors. They reflect back inspiration. Inspiration to try a new recipe. To invite friends over. To fill the dinner table. To clean the colossal mess. There goes the needle flying off the record player again at the mention of cleaning. Maybe, just maybe, the pull of that copper bar across the dishwasher at the end of a dinner party will spark some sort of excitement to clean. If not, pour an extra glass of wine and turn up the music. Because come morning, a clean kitchen can be known to spark breakfast inspiration. That you can count on.
