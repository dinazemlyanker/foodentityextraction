Less than 10 ingredients. You got this.By Rachel KartenFebruary 27, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailAlex LauFacebookTwitterEmailThis recipe is so easy you could make it with your eyes closed. But, you know what? It\u2019s VERY DANGEROUS to cook with your eyes closed. And people should really stop describing recipes this way. So, how about this: This recipe is so easy you could make it with your eyes open but, like, just-woke-up, sort-of-groggy open. You only use one pan. There\u2019s less than 10 ingredients. And it comes together in only 15 minutes. Alright, let\u2019s do this.One-Skillet Creamy Chickpeas with Eggs and ProsciuttoChickpeas in a spicy tomato-cream bath are what you need on a weeknight.View RecipeFirst, throw a sprig of rosemary and thinly-sliced garlic in hot oil. (Very cool way to make your kitchen smell like a Diptyque candle.) When the rosemary gets crisp (but not brown) remove it and set aside on a plate. Keep the garlic going for about two minutes. Next, add in the chickpeas, tomato paste, and paprika. Stir, stir, stir for one minute. Then add in one cup of heavy cream\u2014record scratch freeze frame\u2014yep, there\u2019s a lot of cream going in here but if you don\u2019t use all of it you will regret it. Okay, back to the recipe.Once you\u2019ve got a simmering tomato jacuzzi going on, drop your eggs in, season with salt, and cover. Hot tip: if you don\u2019t have a matching lid, use a baking sheet. Improv stresses me out... except when it\u2019s in the kitchen. When the white parts of your eggs are set but the yolks are still runny (this took about three minutes for me), remove the pan from heat. You\u2019re almost done.Now this is my favorite recipe instruction. \u201cDrape prosciutto around eggs.\u201d Wow. Will do. And if you\u2019re like me, you\u2019ll spend an inordinate amount of time trying to get really pretty ripples and folds (it\u2019s called fashion sweetie, look it up!). Finally, crumble your crispy rosemary on top of everything and sprinkle with sea salt and pepper. Alright, you\u2019re ready. Or are you? For a real standing-ovation finale, serve this with some flatbread. I bought naan and then warmed it up over a burner to get some extra char. You\u2019re going to want this for Sopping Purposes later. And that\u2019s it! Easy, right? Just please make it with your eyes open.Get the recipe: One-Skillet Creamy Chickpeas with Eggs and ProsciuttoExplore Bon App\u00e9titProsciuttoEggDinnerWeeknightRecipes you want to make.
