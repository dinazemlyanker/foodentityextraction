We asked 80 of the most interesting people we know to reveal the local spots they love the most.Here\u2019s a wild bit of trivia for your next cocktail party. Or shrimp cocktail party for that matter. Because Oklahoma has more man-made lakes than any other state, some say it boasts more miles of shoreline than the Atlantic and Gulf coasts combined. But let\u2019s not beat around the bush. This place is landlocked.I didn\u2019t see an ocean for the first time until I was eight years old. The closest I had ever been up to that point was White River Fish Market in Tulsa, where generations of families have gone to feast on fresh Gulf catfish, red beans and rice, gumbo, rainbow trout, and endless hushpuppies. The hushpuppies are as indispensable to this experience as baguettes are to a summer in Paris. It\u2019s hard to know the exact date, but sometime in the mid-1980s, around the time I was in kindergarten, I had my first White River hushpuppy. I\u2019d always liked cornbread. This was something else. This was love.White River, located in an unassuming strip mall not far from the airport, has a strong cafeteria vibe with Formica tables pushed close together in order to squeeze in as many diners as possible. It\u2019s not uncommon to be elbow to elbow with complete strangers during a busy lunch. The long cases of seafood on ice serve to both stir the appetite and present quite a challenge to anyone with decision-making issues.All the fish and sides.\nPhoto by Valerie GrantIt opened in 1932 as a counter-service fish market in downtown Tulsa at the height of the Great Depression when Oklahoma was most often known for being part of the Dust Bowl, a time when far more businesses were closing than opening. The restaurant part didn\u2019t come for another decade (billed honestly as \u201cSea Food Restaurant\u201d). In 1965 the market and restaurant moved to its current location, the only one I\u2019ve ever known. Its simple, folksy founding motto, \u201cyou pick \u2019em, we fix \u2019em\u201d works as a kind of de facto mission statement that endures to this day.Despite its somewhat misnomer of a name, the actual White River doesn\u2019t even run through Oklahoma (see Arkansas and Missouri). Most of the seafood\u2014shrimp, soft-shell crab, rainbow trout, flounder, frog legs (they don\u2019t taste exactly like chicken)\u2014is flown in from the Gulf or the coasts, hence the handy proximity to the airport.There are four kinds of meals: smoked (just salmon), grilled, broiled, and, of course, fried. Each has its own individual merits. But for my money, and considering I\u2019m not eating there every day, I almost always go full-on-fried. I\u2019m like some kind of prairie Proust, with the impact of that first hushpuppy continuing all these years later. The little crispy pieces of batter that break off and collect underneath serve as their own unique treat.The counter for picking your seafood.\nPhoto by Valerie GrantDue to all kinds of forces, gentrification among them, there aren\u2019t as many places where I can go to lunch and see road crews in orange vests eating next to suited-up business folks. The best restaurants still have the power to blur those lines. There\u2019s really no way to compare this humble space to the likes of Boston\u2019s legendary chain Legal Sea Foods or a buzzy spot like Seattle\u2019s the Walrus and the Carpenter, but I once had the opportunity to take a well-known food writer to a hopping weekday lunch at White River. That writer ordered nearly one of everything, covering our booth table with endless plates and platters. The response to most of the food was borderline rapturous. The cornmeal-crusted catfish was a memorable standout, so simple and humble it somehow embodies the hardworking era in which the restaurant was born. I realized in that moment that I\u2019d been taking White River Fish Market for granted. I never will again.Jeff Martin is the founder of Magic City Books.ContentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Explore Bon App\u00e9titNeighborhood RestaurantsFishRecipes you want to make.
