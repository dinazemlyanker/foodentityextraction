Brewmaster Dave Varga makes clean, nuanced original beers, like the beautifully hopped Ocean (a west coast pale ale) or the ripe and fruity Euphoria (a Belgian Tripel). Once you\u2019ve downed a pint or two, get the pan-fried pierogies, kettle chips and dip, \u201cLoaded\u201d (a.k.a. ham, egg, and smoked cheddar biscuit sandwich), the crispy cauliflower and mango salad, and a plate of waffles, if you\u2019re there on the weekend.THE VIBE IS: far more L.A. than Vancouver, where everything is sunlit and white, with just the right number of plants. Owner Joshua Michnik is a photographer and designer, so you\u2019ll see a lot of 33 Acres merch proudly worn throughout the city.PRACTICAL STUFF: Open every day: Monday to Friday, from 9 a.m. to 11 p.m.; and Saturday and Sunday, from 10 a.m. to 11 p.m. (brunch ends at 2 p.m.). No reservations.\u2014Lindsay AndersonGrant HarderGrant HarderExplore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
