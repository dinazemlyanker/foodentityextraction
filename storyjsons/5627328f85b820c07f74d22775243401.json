To avoid tearing the meat, pound it with a glancing (diagonal) motion rather than straight down, working from the center of the breast to the edge. This recipe is from the latest edition of Joy of Cooking, our February 2020 Cookbook Club pick.Adapted and excerpted from Joy of Cooking by John Becker and Megan Scott. Copyright \u00a9\ufe0f 2019.

Delicious!brushjlsolon, ohio1/30/2021Delicious! Fixing for 2nd time tomorrow!  Natalie Hurdle WierzbaNOLA living in LA, CA1/28/2021I add broccoli\nJulieIllinois12/15/2020One of my favourite chicken recipes. Great taste, especially the meaty cheesy over the salty prosciutto. This dish received many compliments when I made it for the family, it\u2019s a staple now.AnonymousVictoria, Australia 8/22/2020I normally don\u2019t make anything other than asian food, but this was pretty good. I couldn\u2019t get the chicken to fold together on the edges so the cheese came out. Perhaps I needed practice on using the mallet. Although it had cheese all over the sides, it tasted great. I would definitely try it again. ByeOhio, US6/3/2020Ultimately very tasty and pretty quick to make. Getting the chicken to stay together and not let the ham/cheese slip out of the sides is the hardest part. A little patience and it comes together nicely. danimalcrackersChicago4/27/2020Delicious! Simpler take on a traditional cordon bleu. Served with broccoli & rice pilaf. Anonymous3/29/2020Fantastic, super simple and fast. I made it with a side of herbed and spiced saut\u00e9ed zucchini and loved it.AnonymousColorado3/8/2020Explore Bon App\u00e9titSwissEuropeanChicken BreastChickenPoultryHamMeatProsciuttoGruy\u00e8reCheeseSwiss CheeseMainNut-FreeDinnerRecipes you want to make.
