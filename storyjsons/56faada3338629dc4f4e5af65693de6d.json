But in summer everyone\u2019s drinking by the canal. It\u2019s heaven.ORDER THE: wines you\u2019ve never heard of. It\u2019s a choose-your-own-adventure kind of place. The knowledgeable team will help you find that perfect glass (or bottle) to pair with your charcuterie and croque monsieur. New to natural wine? The Wednesday tastings are a good place to start. And on Mondays a different visiting chef will fill the big copper pot with something delicious. Help yourself until it runs out.THE VIBE IS: scruffy (but studied) chic.  The corner canalside spot still feels like the centuries-old storefront it once was, but stroll back and you\u2019ll find midcentury furniture from Jean Prouv\u00e9. Off-duty and visiting chefs and wine nerds mix with design-driven locals.PRACTICAL STUFF: Open Monday to Saturday from noon to 10 p.m. Closed Sunday.\u2014Christine MuhlkeWE ALSO LOVEVinskabetIndulge your inner wine geek at this breezy N\u00f8rrebro bar.AncestraleIn Vesterbro, a cool little wine bar (and a relief to your wallet) Den VandretteGet your L\u2019Anglore fix at this sunny Indre By wine barExplore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
