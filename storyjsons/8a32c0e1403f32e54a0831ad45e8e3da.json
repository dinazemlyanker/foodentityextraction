I\u2019ve made it many times and wouldn\u2019t dare stray. But I will add in some tuna for extra fish points.Not just any tuna salad, but GREEN GODDESS tuna salad is calling. I can\u2019t believe this calls for both mayo and sour cream. Fine, I\u2019ll do it!A little tuna on Andy Baraghani\u2019s fancy tomato toast would be divine.Tuna and avocado, what a combo. Make this dip, grab a box of Triscuits, and call it lunch.Tuna would be great in place of rotisserie chicken in this rice bowl with a lip-smacking scallion sauce.Will I go all out, defrost the puff pastry, invest in HAM, and make epic tuna empanadas? Maybe!String up some Christmas lights, make a pot of black coffee, and re-create my favorite diner with a cheese-oozing tuna melt. Side of too many chips.Sure, tuna in any ol\u2019 salad is probably going to work, but especially up against the shallot vinaigrette, feta, and dill in this chopped number.Another salad, forgive me, but this escarole Caesar was developed by Molly Baz with tinned fish in mind.
