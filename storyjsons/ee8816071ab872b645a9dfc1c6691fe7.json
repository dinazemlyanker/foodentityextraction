Precooking the squash seasons and softens it, but don\u2019t let it get dry or brown. The moisture it retains ensures it will be tender after baking and helps keep the caramel saucy.Ingredients8 servings6Tbsp. chilled unsalted butter, divided, plus more for pan1large butternut squash (about 3\u00bd lb.)1cup plus 2 Tbsp. granulated sugar, divided\u00bctsp. kosher salt, plus more1Tbsp. fresh lemon juice1tsp. vanilla extract\u00bdShortcut Puff PastryAll-purpose flour (for surface)1cup chilled heavy cream1Tbsp. powdered sugar\u00bdtsp. ground cinnamonPreparationStep 1Place a rack in upper third of oven; preheat to 350\u00b0. Butter a 10\" springform pan or cake pan and line bottom with a parchment paper round. Cut off neck from squash. Peel neck and bulb until you reveal the orange flesh underneath (you might need to take off a few layers). Slice both pieces in half lengthwise; scoop out seeds. Slice all squash pieces crosswise \u00bc\" thick. Arrange on a rimmed baking sheet. Melt 3 Tbsp. butter in a small saucepan and drizzle over squash. Sprinkle with \u00bc cup granulated sugar\nand a pinch of salt and toss to coat. Arrange squash in a single layer (use a second rimmed baking sheet if needed) and roast until tender and just starting to curl around the edges but not yet browned, 30\u201335 minutes. Let cool. Carefully move oven rack to highest position and increase oven temperature to 400\u00b0.Step 2Meanwhile, cut remaining 3 Tbsp. butter into pieces and set aside. Bring lemon juice, \u00be cup granulated sugar, and 3 Tbsp. water to a boil in a large saucepan over medium-low heat, stirring with a heatproof rubber spatula until sugar is dissolved. Continue to cook, swirling pan often (do not stir), until caramel is light amber in color, 6\u20138 minutes. Remove from heat and add reserved butter a piece at a time, stirring after each addition until incorporated and smooth. Once all the butter has been added, stir in vanilla and remaining \u00bc tsp. salt. Pour caramel into prepared springform pan and tilt to coat bottom. Let cool.Step 3Starting with slices from the neck, layer squash in an overlapping rosette pattern over caramel.ChevronChevronStep 4Sprinkle with 1 Tbsp. granulated sugar. Arrange remaining squash over first layer, placing pieces wherever needed to create an even thickness of squash across entire tart (this layer doesn\u2019t need to be pretty since it won\u2019t be visible).Photo by Michael Graydon + Nikole Herriott, food styling by Rebecca Jurkevich, prop styling by Kalen KaminskiStep 5Sprinkle with remaining 1 Tbsp. granulated sugar and chill while you roll out the puff pastry.Step 6Let pastry sit at room temperature about 4 minutes to soften slightly. Roll out on a lightly floured surface, dusting with more flour as needed to prevent sticking and rotating a few times, to a round that\u2019s a little over 11\". Using pan as a template, trim excess dough to make an 11\" round. Using a fork, prick pastry in 12\u201315 places. Drape pastry over squash and use a spoon to tuck edges in slightly between squash and sides of pan.ChevronChevronStep 7Bake tarte Tatin 20 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 350\u00b0 and continue to bake until pastry is puffed and golden brown, 45\u201350 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and let cool in pan 10 minutes.Step 8If using a springform pan, remove ring and carefully invert tarte Tatin onto rack (take care as some of the hot caramel could drip). If using a cake pan, set rack upside down over pan and invert tarte Tatin onto rack. Let cool 20 minutes.Step 9Meanwhile, whisk cream in a small bowl to soft peaks. Beat in powdered sugar and cinnamon.Step 10Serve tarte Tatin warm topped with dollops of cinnamon whipped cream.Step 11Do Ahead: Tarte Tatin can be baked 10 hours ahead. Store loosely wrapped at room temperature. Reheat in a 250\u00b0 oven.How would you rate Butternut Squash Tarte Tatin?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (2)Back to TopTriangleI agree with the other review that the caramel needs tweaking. I added a half vanilla bean and entire zested orange to the caramel after the butter was incorporated and that helped a lot. It just needs more zing! Otherwise lovely. Anonymous11/28/2019Very good - but needs some tweaking.  \nMagazine make-ahead suggested you could make the squash and caramel ahead and then bake day of.  NOT a good suggestion.  Hard caramel oozed when refriegerated.  You can make the squash in advance - and then assemble and bake day of.  Squash/caramel needs more flavor.  Will add rum or brandy next time and maybe more vanilla and lemon juice.  AND I don't suggest using rough puff - I will use pate briss\u00e9 or your favorite pie crust next time.  It was chewy and the texture of a pie crust would be preferred. AND it turned out suprisingly thin, given the large squash.  It will only serve 6.  Have photo. Looks nice!
