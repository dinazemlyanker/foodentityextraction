Let eggplant sit until excess liquid is released, 45\u201360 minutes.Place racks in upper and lower thirds of oven; preheat to 350\u00b0. Place panko in a shallow bowl. Beat eggs to blend in another shallow bowl. Place flour in a third shallow bowl. Working one at a time, dredge eggplant slices in flour, then dip in egg, allowing excess to drip off. Coat in breadcrumbs, packing all around; shake off excess. Transfer to a clean rimmed baking sheet as you go.Heat \u00bd cup oil in a large skillet, preferably cast iron, over medium-high.

Uncover eggplant parm and broil on upper rack until cheese is bubbling and browned in spots, about 4 minutes (broilers vary wildly, so start checking after 1 minute to be safe).

Reheat in a 350\u00b0 oven, uncovering halfway through, until bubbling gently at edges before broiling.Recipe by Carla Lalli MusicSponsored by Barilla\u00ae\u00a0Vero GustoGET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for the Bon App\u00e9titNewsletterSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyExplore Bon App\u00e9titBarilla\u00ae Vero GustoCasseroleItalianEggplantMozzarellaMainVegetarianNut-FreeDinnerMore from Bon App\u00e9titRecipes6 Pro Chefs Reveal Their \"Secret Weapon\" Ingredients2022-03-02T17:00:00.000ZrecipePorcini Gnocchi With Butter Sauce2022-03-15T09:00:00.000ZrecipeWhiskey Sour2020-12-16T18:20:00.000ZBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
