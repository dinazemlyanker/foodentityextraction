The good news? It\u2019s even easier to keep your healthyish vibes flowing with the brand new collection of restaurants that deliver good-for-you-food-that-also tastes-good. We teamed up with Caviar, so it\u2019s easier for you to eat what you love and choose from a variety of dishes\u2014some super healthy and others -ish\u2014that you can order right to your door. Whether you\u2019re in L.A., NYC, SF, Portland, Philly or DC we\u2019ve got you covered with Healthyish, delivered. Now, since we\u2019re all hungry, here are a few of our favorites.The Feel-Good Veggie Centric L.A. Hotspot and Their GF Avo ToastLos Angeles has been committed to the wellness movement and health forward restaurant concepts for years, and Honey Hi is a current breakfast and lunch fave in Echo Park. They focus on using the very best local and organic ingredients sourced from neighboring farms, and the entire menu is gluten- and refined sugar-free. The feel-good cafe offers a variety of colorful bowls topped with various seeds and spices, but for a perfect kick-off to the morning we love the sweet potato and avocado toast with paprika-roasted sweet potatoes, lemon avocado mash, scallion, pickled onions, sumac, and herbs on gluten-free sourdough. So, basically, it\u2019s anything but \u201cbasic.\u201dThe Stellar SF Fried-Chicken Sandwich You\u2019ll Dream About Eating AgainYes, we did say some dishes would be healthy and some of them more, -ish! Award-winning restaurant Rich Table\u2019s casual spinoff RT Rotisserie in Hayes Valley serves some of the most mouthwatering rotisserie chicken that\u2019s made in-house with free-range Rocky birds from nearby Petaluma. Before they are roasted, they\u2019re brined in buttermilk, brushed with a rich and smoky garlic oil, and finally seasoned with herbs. Though you can order your chicken in a variety of preparations\u2014with sauces and sides or as a sando\u2014we have to tap the Sally Hurricane\u2019s Southern Fried Chicken Sandwich as a can\u2019t miss choice. The crispy fried chicken is paired with charred cabbage, pickled onions, and chipotle yogurt on a toasted kaiser bun. Winner, winner.Yes, Please! The Best Ramen in Portland Delivered Right to Your DoorWhen it comes to a dinner delivery we crave, there\u2019s nothing better than a comforting bowl of ramen with a rich, umami-laden broth and lots of goodies topping perfectly springy noodles. Food lovers in Southeast Portland have long had Biwa on their healthyish hit list for bowls of ramen and udon, handmade gyoza, onigiri, fresh Japanese-style salads, and their famous char siu pork burger. Open your app and say yes to their house ramen, served with thin Chinese-style noodles in pork, chicken, and dashi soup, with pork belly chashu, boiled egg, bean sprouts, sauteed spinach, green onions, and finished with red-hot flecks of chili oil. It\u2019s a match made in heaven for a night on the couch with your favorite show streaming.Where Plant-Based Dishes Are a Work of Art in NYCNew Yorker\u2019s love a plant-based restaurant with an artisanal and organic focus but when that restaurant also happens to be from Chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten and co-creator Paulette Cole, it takes things to cult status. The stunning abcV wants to do more than just serve good food. They want to inspire a cultural shift towards plant-based eating through their creativity and deliciousness. If you can\u2019t get a reservation, or just don\u2019t want to venture outdoors after that morning work-out session, we\u2019re all for ordering in the yogurt and fruit bowl. It\u2019s made with either coconut or local milk yogurt, fresh seasonal fruits, pollen, salted oats, and seeds and is almost too pretty to eat.Probably Some of the Best Hummus You\u2019ll Ever Try in PhillyIf there was a poster child for healthyish eating, don\u2019t you think it could be hummus? The Israeli favorite, Dizengoff, first landed stateside in Philly back in 2014, and since then has become a hotspot for its freshly-made hummus topped with a variety of seasonal garnishes (think hot-spiced lamb and pine nuts or avocado and harissa). While we\u2019re fans of their daily specials\u2014which you can find updated on their Instagram\u2014there\u2019s something so comforting about ordering a classic. The hummus tehina comes with hearth-baked pita, seasonal salad, and Israeli pickles and is sure to satisfy as a tasty lunch or light dinner.Bird\u2019s The Word: Get Your Greens Fix From This Sustainable DC RestaurantAt Farmbird  in DC, their mission is to change the way people think about chicken. Their perfectly roasted birds feature bold flavors and put a new spin on the nourishing and sustainable foods their owners grew up eating. The food here is always fresh (you won\u2019t find any frozen chicken) and all their menu items are prepared from scratch daily. For a plate that gets you your greens and a sample of their delicious grilled chicken, try the avocado basil. It comes loaded with sliced avo, kale pesto, snap peas, pickled vegetables, slivered almonds, sliced tender chicken breast, and basil. Healthy AND delicious.Caviar is an easy way to order meals from the best local restaurants across the U.S. Customers can order food for pickup or delivery ahead on the web, or instantly from Caviar\u2019s free mobile app for iOS and Android.Explore Bon App\u00e9titSuperpoweredRecipes you want to make.
