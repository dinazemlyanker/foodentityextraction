Store-bought ginger cookies soften into layers of tender cake surrounded by loads of raspberries and lofty caramel cream. We prefer thin ginger cookies, but almond cookies or thicker shortbread would be just as tasty.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Keep chilled.How would you rate Ginger-Raspberry Icebox Cake With Caramel Cream?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (9)Back to TopTriangleThis mess of a dessert was delicious. Somewhat time-consuming, but worth it. When I used the called-for amount of caramel cream in the first layer, I had to skimp on the other layers - so beware. Also,my whipped cream really deflated when I added the caramel, but I think that was my mistake.\nWill make again, for a special occasion.JudyWLouisville KY9/13/2021love this cake. making my second one today but how do you remove the parchment paper when placing the cake onto platter to serve\nSandy BertuccelliHayden Lake, Idaho9/10/2021A wonderful summer dessert. I found all the individual steps to be very straightforward. I used a whole box of Nabisco Gingers Snaps and wish I had more. I was able to remove one piece of the parchment, but not the other. I just cut it off to conceal the edge. I was hoping it would firm up more but it remained fairly soft, even after a day in the fridge. Next time I'll try to get stiffer peaks with the cream. GinaGDenver, CO8/8/2021Great Summer Dessert!  Made once as written and had no problems with the recipe at all.  Made it again just now with blueberries, subbing purchased Fat Toad Caramel and local blackberry jam for the homemade in the recipe-and although the recipe is better, the shortcut version is really delightful.  This one\u2019s a keeper!!!greenmtgirlStowe VT8/7/2021Watch the video. It totally helps. Some of the questions people had in other reviews were answered there. I had extra so after making the 8x8 I made a 4x4. Whip looks good. Tomorrow I\u2019ll take it out of the pan so I\u2019ll see how it holds up. Tastes amazing. Carmel came out nice, I was nervous. JennPalmer, Ak8/3/2021I\u2019m also wondering about where I put it to chill? I\u2019m going to go with fridge and will keep you posted! I also agree with temporarily removing from heat before adding the 1c. Cream then putting it back on the heat. The jam needed more than 6 minutes too - i would say 10 or so, but likely depends on a lot of factors such as stove temp and ripeness of raspberriesAmyBerkeley7/23/2021Silly question\u2026 chill in the fridge or the freezer? I\u2019ve never made icebox cake before.Anonymous7/19/2021Totally agree with the other review. This is a really poorly written recipe. I\u2019m on my second go of trying to make it so we will see how it turns out. Anonymous7/17/2021Really lovely recipe that I ended up having to make several times due to hiccups. When adding the cream to the caramel, I found it significantly easier to remove it from the heat and in a very slow dribble whisk in the cream. This will stop it from seizing. You can add all of the cream for the whipped cream at this stage as whipping part of it and then adding the caramel cream disrupts the aeration and leads to deflated cream. Adding a \u00bd teaspoon of salt went a long way. I find occasionally the way recipes are written here omits crucial information for the sake of brevity and I can't say I appreciate it. More through information is always better.Anonymous7/16/2021Explore Bon App\u00e9titCakeDessertFrozen DessertAmericanRaspberryBerryFruitSummerEasyNut-FreeRecipes you want to make.
