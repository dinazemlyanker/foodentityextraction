The dish is then finished with lemon juice, grated coconut, and cilantro. Depending on which state in South India you\u2019re in, this same preparation is referred to by different names, such as thoran or poriyal.While seasonal produce is preferred, this combination makes even the saddest of vegetables at the back of your fridge sing. Green beans are my favorite choice, but the recipe is extremely flexible and can be applied to beets, cabbage, potatoes, and, as I\u2019ve discovered lately, asparagus.The unique step in this green beans recipe is chopping them into \u00bc-inch pieces. It may seem like a mundane, monotonous task, but for me it\u2019s meditative. It also has major payoff\u2014the increased surface area maximizes flavor (at least that\u2019s my theory). I recall my mother sitting behind a heap of these green beans at our kitchen table in the evenings. She would cut the beans up before going to bed and then the next day after work, she would grab them from the fridge and quickly saut\u00e9 them for our dinner.The other reason the beans are chopped so small is because they\u2019re easier to eat in the traditional way, which is by hand with roti or with rice. I\u2019ve found, though, that I prefer to cut and cook green beans in this fashion even if I just eat them along with a non-Indian meal, like thrown on top of a taco or folded into an omelet. They\u2019re quite versatile.To make a meal of it, layer on top of chitranna with yogurt raita or plain yogurt and achaar.Get the recipe:Green Beans PalyaPalya is a classic South Indian recipe usually composed of a single vegetable chopped into bite-size pieces and saut\u00e9ed in oil that has been seasoned with black mustard seeds, asafetida, chile, and curry leaves.
