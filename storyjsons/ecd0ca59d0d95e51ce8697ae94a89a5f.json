Chris ended the segment by saying, \u201cNo matter how hard you\u2019re working, there\u2019s always time to call Mom.\u201d\u201cI called Mom,\u201d the governor responded. \u201cBy the way, she said I was her favorite. Good news is, she said you were her second-favorite son.\u201d The tit-for-tat became a rare moment of levity for a very stressed out country\u2014a much-needed, warm-hearted distraction.If you are from an Italian family\u2014or have at least joined one of us for a home-cooked meal\u2014you\u2019d know that the mother is often the anchor of our households, the foil to tough-as-nails fathers, the reason we put aside our differences and begrudgingly agree to sit peacefully for a meal. Mom is the nurturer and provider, the one who\u2019s always asking if you\u2019re hungry before prying into the details of your personal life. The Cuomos\u2019 \u201ccall Mom\u201d shtick is a classic move by us Italian children who are always vying for her attention, affection, or (let\u2019s be honest) culinary talents. It\u2019s our way of saying, \u201cI talked to Mom and you didn\u2019t, you ungrateful bastard.\u201dUnfortunately, this guilt trip rarely worked on me. I was the only one of Mom's five children to fly the coop, landing hundreds of miles from Boston in New York City. Mom always wants to speak to me, and usually comes prepared with detailed questions about what\u2019s happening in my life, prompted by tweets she\u2019s read or scenes she\u2019s observed on my Instagram Story. For much of the last 10 years, we\u2019ve endured an unfortunate routine every time I finally answered the phone: When are you coming home next? And then, when I do agree to come home, the frantic back-and-forth: Why are you staying for so short a time? What can I cook for you before you get here? Who should we see while you\u2019re home? Is your fianc\u00e9 coming? (If no: Why not? Does he have to work? Is everything okay? If yes: What does he like to eat? Should we make reservations? Your father will pick a place. What does his mother cook for him? I can make that.) I frequently dodged the phone calls, only to inevitably get a text from my sister: \u201cPlease call Mom, she\u2019s driving me nuts.\u201dOnce Governor Cuomo officially sanctioned shelter-in-place orders in New York City, my mom (like most mothers, I\u2019m sure) panicked. The FaceTime calls started coming daily, lasting for as long as it took for me to calm her anxiety. She was prepared to drive down to my apartment in Brooklyn to come get me and bring me home\u2014regardless of the potential risk I could expose her to. I had to explain that social distancing was designed to protect people in her age group, and that she was the most at risk of anyone in our family, not me. Resolved to her confinement, Mom responded by printing her own shipping labels and mailing me boxes filled with \u201cessentials,\u201d including bleach, Lysol wipes, and...freshly-baked loaves of banana bread.How would I ever be able to forgive myself for not calling when she asked, for not going home when I had the chance?Trapped in my own apartment, I (like many millennials) have enjoyed using this time to try recipes I could never have imagined myself cooking before. With my fianc\u00e9 working 12-hour shifts at the hospital, I find myself alone more than I\u2019d like in this particular moment, which often allows my curiosity to get the best of me. Whenever I panic or second guess myself\u2014which is often, especially when making anything that involves multiple pans\u2014I call mom.I FaceTimed her one Sunday because I wanted to make my first-ever batch of Italian wedding soup, but I couldn\u2019t find chicken broth anywhere in Brooklyn. She sent me to the grocery store for a whole chicken, celery, carrots, herbs, and onion, then coached me on making my own\u2014following along for three hours as I skimmed the top and the broth came to a hearty simmer. I began to grow impatient with the whole process, and even though she warned me against adding the orzo pasta too early, I did it anyway. Sure enough, the orzo soaked up all the broth in just a couple of hours. I called her back to let her know she was right. \u201cNow you know for next time,\u201d she said.The next day, she followed up to ask what I was doing with the leftover chicken. She reminded me that my fianc\u00e9 was particularly fond of quesadillas, so I shred it into small pieces, chopped some cilantro, and grated some cotija cheese. When he came home for dinner that night, he was elated, proclaiming that this was my \u201cbest meal yet.\u201d (As someone who had recently prepared eight pounds of Momofuku Ss\u00e4m-inspired pork butt, I was thoroughly unamused.)One time when she had come to visit, she insisted on making a homemade eggplant parmesan, which my fianc\u00e9 promptly devoured in under 24 hours. A few weeks ago, I got inspired to make the same thing happen again in an attempt to lift his spirits. I consulted Mom on my list of ingredients and tackled the recipe myself. Over FaceTime, she reviewed the width of my eggplant cutlets and schooled me on how to properly salt them upright in a colander to avoid a watery finished result. She also insisted I dry out loaves of Italian bread instead of using store-bought breadcrumbs\u2014apparently those are a sin. (Who knew?) So I blended two whole loaves of scali bread, a few slices at a time, until I was finally left with rich, golden crumbs. To make it extra special, I prepared my own pomarola, following a Samin Nosrat recipe that is basically the same as a typical red sauce, but at the end you add a cup of expensive olive oil and pur\u00e9e it in a blender. The finished product is a delightfully creamy, practically velvety, fire-red sauce\u2014I used it to build my layers of eggplant, mozzarella, and shredded basil exactly as Mom advised.I sent her a picture of the pot right as I removed it from the oven, concerned that it looked too charred on the top, especially compared to hers. \u201cIt looks perfect,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re becoming a really good cook.\u201d I was sure she was lying to make me feel better, but I got a text from her the following night, asking for the pomarola recipe. This time, she sent me a video from her phone, adding the oil to her red sauce, letting me watch along with her as it emulsified to find its new, creamy texture.Once the grocery stores became even more precarious to visit (my fianc\u00e9 barely has enough surgical masks at the hospital, let alone for me to wear while running errands), I decided to order online from our local fish market and butcher. Once I saw the menu, I puzzled over the options\u2014I couldn\u2019t just ask the person behind the counter for their opinion like I always do. Mom guided me through selecting a chicken of appropriate weight, meatballs with the right kind of beef chuck, and a pound of prosciutto for snacking\u2014and she urged me to treat my fianc\u00e9 to his favorite: ribeye steaks. When everything was delivered, I called her as I put it all away, thanking her for her help. She saw the inside of my fridge via FaceTime and suggested I place my parsley and cilantro upright in small glasses of water so they would stay fresh. Once again, she knew best: They lasted for two whole weeks longer than average.I realized recently that, even though I\u2019m not physically with my mom, at home with her like she\u2019d prefer, we are speaking more during quarantine than we ever have before. Most days of the week, we\u2019re on FaceTime trading recipes or cooking together, or she\u2019s watching me unbox the latest shipment of baked goods she\u2019s sent to the apartment. Sometimes we are both quiet, going about our routines, comforted just knowing that a person we love is on the other side, healthy and doing their best.Sometimes, when I\u2019m home alone at night and my fianc\u00e9 is late returning from work, I start to spiral. How can you sleep when the collective sadness is so damn loud? Sometimes I lay with my face down in the pillow and cry as I think of the people I read about that day. I imagine the worst-case scenarios for my loved ones\u2014what this pandemic could do if we are not careful, what kind of havoc it could wreak on our lives. I think of seeing my mom on FaceTime, and the fear fills my throat to the brim. It\u2019s people her age who are being intubated or placed on ventilators, left alone in the hospitals without family to help them. What would I ever do if something happened to her? How much of our time spent apart would I regret? How would I ever be able to forgive myself for not calling when she asked, for not going home when I had the chance?It may have taken the fear induced by a global pandemic, but I think I finally grasp the scope of my mother\u2019s love. I understand the incessant yearning that came from my mother when I moved away\u2014and the kind of heartbreak that comes from not being able to reach out and see me when she wants to. I\u2019m beginning to understand why, whenever I\u2019m home, she clings to me like I\u2019m already gone, like I\u2019m disappearing before her while she\u2019s holding my sleeve.On my birthday last weekend, my fianc\u00e9 led me to his laptop, and suddenly I heard screams of \u201cSurprise!\u201d My friends had organized a Zoom party without me finding out\u2014a major coup on their part. Beneath the surprise, though, lay a familiar virus-induced sadness: I didn\u2019t realize how much I\u2019d miss hugging these people I love.Right before everyone sang happy birthday, my doorbell rang: the chocolate bundt cake Mom had mailed arrived right on time. I blew out the candles and looked at the screen full of people clapping, laughing, and blowing kisses. At the top left corner was my mother, smiling into her camera, looking over me.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishHealthyish Guide to Being AloneCoronavirusessayRead MorecookingMake a Whole Galette For Yourself Because You\u2019re Worth ItBy Sarah JampelRecipes you want to make.
