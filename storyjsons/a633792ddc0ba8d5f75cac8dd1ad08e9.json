It\u2019s fermented until fizzy and tangy\u2014but not truly alcoholic. It\u2019s also the key ingredient in the dish that made chef Anthony Salguero of Popoca want to cook Salvadoran food in the first place: gallo en chicha, rooster braised in a pineapple-skin chicha. For this recipe we\u2019re using chicken, and because chicha can be hard to find, Salguero suggests combining pineapple juice and apple cider vinegar as a substitute in this recipe. If you happen to get your hands on some chicha, or go the extra mile to make it yourself, replace the pineapple juice with 2 cups chicha and reduce the vinegar to \u00bd cup.Ingredients4 Servings6skin-on, bone-in chicken thighsKosher salt, freshly ground pepper2Tbsp. vegetable oil1large onion, cut into 1\" pieces4medium carrots (about 10 oz.), peeled, halved lengthwise10garlic cloves, halved10oz. fingerling potatoes, scrubbed, halved lengthwise2Tbsp.

I used a spicy homemade tepache instead of chicha and it was super. I will definitely make this again.IvyPhiladelphia, PA1/24/2021This was incredible! The flavor in the relajo is outstanding - at first I was hesitant to  put so much time and ingredients into just one portion of the meal - but it was damn worth it. The cinnamon / anise gives it a flavor that I really haven't been even able to come close to tasting since lockdown. What a variation!! leilaChicago, IL11/8/2020This is an amazing recipe. Great depth of flavor. I am going to give it a try with pineapple kombucha just for fun. It is annoying though when a picture of the dish is not actually what is represented in the recipe. There are no chicken legs in the ingredients and the chicken in the photo is obviously charred for photo op only. AnonymousIdaho11/2/2020This was one of the best things I've made or eaten recently--both my partner and I were astonished by how good it was. The linked recipe for Relajo makes a lot, but after experiencing that spice mix I'm glad we have so much of it left over -- I'll be using it in everything. The chicken's also relatively easy and comes together in one pot. I would ignore the person who complained about the acidity of the vinegar-- the recipe as is is perfect, just make sure both the vinegar and pineapple juice actually reduce. I might try pre-crisping the cut side of the potatoes next time after searing the chicken and before starting the braise base, but that's just my preferred texture. We're going to try tearing up the leftover chicken and making quesadillas with it tonight with some oaxaca cheese. AnonymousNew York10/20/2020This dish is wonderful. During the pandemic I try to limit my trips to the store but I had almost everything. Used pure cacoa powder in lieu of nibs for the relajo , no prunes so added equal amt of golden raisins, no pineapple juice but pureed canned crushed pineapple. It came together beautifully. One reviewer was unhappy with vinegar but if reduced properly it really offsets the sweet elements added to the stew. I would love to use the sauce for pulled pork. carringtonashSouth Carolina10/13/2020We made this last night for dinner after reading the recipe in the October issue. We made a few minor substitutions on the spice blend but added the called-for amount of vinegar and pineapple juice. Incredibly flavorful and absolutely delicious. Very well balanced and the chicken was super tender.  Highly recommend the recipe as-is!NotfoodbloggersCharleston, SC 10/7/2020Absolutely amazing recipe!! I made this for dinner the first time tonight and my family (husband and 4 kids) all loved it. I love the reduced vinegar touch, it's something I use often and adds an amazing depth. Don't change a thing! And try this right away!PandemoniumVirginia10/5/2020This recipe was absolutely delicious until adding the questionable \u00be cup apple cider vinegar. The dish became way too acidic, and that was only worsened by the pineapple juice. If I make this again I will only use 1/4 cup of vinegar and half the pineapple juice, watered down. If you want to avoid the excessive sourness I suggest omitting the vinegar and pineapple completely and substituting more chicken broth. The sweet/sour of the prunes is enough, and you'll have more of a classic, pallet-able stew.AnonymousToronto, Ontario10/5/2020If you are making Chicha an integral part of the recipe as well as having it on the cover of the story in the mag, please include a recipe for it.
