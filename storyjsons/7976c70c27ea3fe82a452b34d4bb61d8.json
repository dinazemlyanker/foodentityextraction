However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.Recently, I put myself through a financial audit, which revealed some weak spots\u2014including a $9-a-pop fresh juice habit. So I began the hunt for the best juicer on the market, thinking that even with primo organic produce, I could halve, if not quarter, the cost of each juice by making it at home. \u00a0I love greens, but I also love the idea of saving for retirement.This might have all been an elaborate mind game I played with myself to justify purchasing an electric juicer, because this baby (and when I say baby I am referring to the sweet angel that is the Omega NC900HDC) doesn\u2019t come cheap. Its price is up there with investment kitchen appliances like your KitchenAid stand mixer and Cuisinart food processor. Let me say first: If you very rarely drink juice, no amount of financial wellness gymnastics is going to make this a smart purchase. But if you\u2019re prone to swilling a weekly kale-cucumber and that sets you back $9 or so, the juicer will pay for itself in a year. And after that year? The two of you will be happy for decades(!) to come, thanks to the 15-year warranty on this machine (the longest in the juicing industry).Omega NC900HDC Juicer$460 at AmazonI understand if the idea of juicing brings to mind the elitist fad diets of the early 2000s, but juice is for everyone and can be enjoyed without deprivation\u2014for wellness purposes, sure, but also just because it\u2019s damn delicious. As my wise friend, wellness expert and founder of the Ocho System Joe Holder said on Instagram recently, \u201cJuicing is a wildly polarizing choice likely because it was one of the first exploited trends of the \u2018wellness revolution\u2019 for economic gain\ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb0.\u201d Despite those negative connotations, Joe is very much still into juice\u2014scroll on down for two of his favorite recipes. \u201cI juice at home \u2019cause it\u2019s an easy way to stay hydrated,\u201d says Joe, who also touts the quick intake of vitamins and minerals from juicing. (He also stresses the value of fiber: \u201cThis is why you should still eat whole fruits and veggies\u201d in addition to juice, he tells me.) Joe has a literal MasterClass on wellness, so I\u2019m happy to follow his lead.What are the different types of juicers?There are two main kinds of juicer machines\u2014masticating (also known as slow juicers or cold-press juicers) and centrifugal. Slow masticating machines have a methodical auger (sort of like a large, sharp corkscrew) that is best suited to working its way through leafy greens, but will take on fibrous stalks and soft and juicy fruit as well. Hard-core juicers love masticating machines because they don\u2019t heat up the produce in the process (possibly causing oxidation) and because they produce very little foam. Also, these mighty machines can somehow squeeze a pale green elixir from even the most papery kale leaves. \u201cYou get a lot of juice from this type [of juicer], which leads to less waste and cost over time\u2014even if masticating juicers are more expensive up front,\u201d Holder says. Slow masticating juicers are also soooooothing, humming along at low speed like a patient countertop grazing animal. They\u2019re not silent, but they sure beat the lawn mower-like noise of some centrifugal juicers.But besides that noisiness, centrifugal juicers do have their appeal. They\u2019re often less expensive, for one. Centrifugal juicers tear produce to shreds and then push the pulp through a stainless-steel mesh strainer. It\u2019s a more efficient process, leading to a faster morning green juice. They also tend to be easier to use, smaller, and have dishwasher-safe parts.\u00a0And if you\u2019re looking for the best citrus juicer? Right this way.Which Citrus Juicer Is the Best Citrus Juicer for You?The best lemon squeezers for control freaks, luddites, and Jimmy BuffetsView StorySo why is the Omega NC900HDC Premium Juicer the best juicer?This slow masticating juicer is easy to use with a 2.5\" feed chute that is wider than others\u2014which means you can cut down on pre-pulverizing prep time. The five grind-size settings on the end cap will easily take you from soft fruit (setting 1) to wheatgrass (setting 5). \u201cI\u2019ve had this Omega model for 6 years and use it almost daily,\u201d says Daphne Javitch, health coach and mastermind of @doingwell. \u201cIt\u2019s durable, versatile (we also make banana ice cream with it), and, most importantly, I find it easy to clean,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a worthwhile investment that endures\u2014I call it the Manolo Blahnik of slow juicers.\u201d In addition to cold-pressed juice, this Omega model can turn out nut butters and nut milks, baby food and other pur\u00e9es, and sorbet.Omega NC900HDC Juicer$460 at AmazonBut what if I just want fruit juice?All that being said, if you\u2019re more after hard produce like apples and carrots and aren\u2019t worried about oxidation or foam, a centrifugal machine is the ideal machine. For you, fruit juice friend, the Breville Juice Fountain Plus is the best centrifugal juicer. This high-speed machine is incredibly well built and simple to use, and the 3\"-wide mouth feed tube means that even for an already speedy centrifugal juicer, you\u2019ll be whizzing along, as you probably won\u2019t even need to chop your produce. Included with the machine are a juice jug, which comes with a froth separator to help skim off that foam, and a cleaning brush.Breville JE98XL Juice Fountain Plus$160 at Amazon$180 at Bed Bath & BeyondAnd if I want to spend under $100 on a juicer?I would go for the Hamilton Beach Big Mouth juicer, a centrifugal machine whose main selling point is right in the product name. The wide feed chute can fit a whole apple, peeled citrus fruits, or an entire beet. At $70, it costs considerably less than the other two\u2014expect a less sturdy construction and a limited 3-year warranty.Still, this fairly streamlined (7.8\" x 11.5\" x 14.4\") machine won\u2019t hog your counter space, is easy to assemble, dishwasher-safe, and makes a mean glass of juice (particularly the fruity kind).Hamilton Beach Big Mouth Juicer$70 at Amazon$70 at TargetLooking for some recipes for your new juicer?
