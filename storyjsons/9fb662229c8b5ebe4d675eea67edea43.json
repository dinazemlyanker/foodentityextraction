It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.Where the free samples floweth\u201cWe get our freak on in kitchen!\u201d said a decidedly un-freaky lady handing me a spoonful of carrot pesto. Here I was again, at the Fancy Food Show, a gigantic trade expo where grocery shops go to grocery shop. And where I go to scope out new snacks. The pesto I was tasting was from Freak Flag Foods, and I really can\u2019t emphasize enough here, they were very normal (the people and the pesto). (Yes! I was disappointed!)Among the thousands of booths of too many honeys, 14 types of coconut yogurt, and \u201cnew\u201d takes on popcorn, I had some special moments. Like when one of the keto ice cream bros handed me a taste of the coffee flavor and the act of scooping made his biceps bulge and quiver in ways I\u2019d never seen before. He looked deeply into my eyes and said, \u201cit\u2019s made with three plant-based sweeteners.\u201d A samplin\u2019 man, mistaking me for a brand rep, asked if my mushroom jerky would be sellable to the kosher market. I heard a butter broker broker a deal for butter!My favorite snacks included Pasha Delights tahini gelato. Owl\u2019s Brew\u2019s Boozy Tea, \u2014yes, like Twisted Tea\u2014is something I would like to drink in a flamingo floatie. Brins lemon saffron jam (and chili jam). And I\u2019m strangely drawn to MudLrk\u2019s shitake chips (bbq flavor), which reminded me of a bunch of little Toads in Super Mario Bros.The friendlist folks I met were in town from Minnesota promoting Terroir Chocolates (try the salty nibber). It was their first time in New York City. Their review? \u201cWe\u2019re havin\u2019 a hoot!\u201dWant this letter before it hits the website?

I made them last weekend and will continue to make them all summer. They\u2019re like the vegetarian version of our awesome sambal chicken skewers: sweet-and-spicy glaze gets cooked down and brushed over the veg while grilling. (But this one\u2019s easier.) The cross-thatched cut on the squash soaks up the glaze. I didn\u2019t even do the very-Andy herb salad on top, but I\u2019m sure it plays against the heat nicely.Get the recipe: Sweet and Spicy Grilled Summer SquashReporting from CrabfestA tall, tan man with flowing white hair glided over to my table at Red Lobster\u2019s Crabfest event this week. \u201cDo you work at Red Lobster?\u201d a RL employee asked him politely. But no, this Poseiden in a pale blue Hawaiian shirt was Captain Wild Bill from Discovery\u2019s Deadliest Catch. He was going to show us how to make fettuccine with crab, scallops, lobster, and a tomato-alfredo sauce. Next to me, an Instagram star took a selfie in her plastic crab bib and told us about her journey from being a school teacher in the Bronx to a full-time jet-setting influencer. \u201cI loved it,\u201d she professed, \u201cbut this is so much more fulfilling.\u201dRead itAlex Delany wrote about Anthony Bourdain\u2019s influence on the way he eats-while-traveling in honor of #BourdainDay this week: \u201cThere was real reward in his unbridled curiosity for places more honest than famed.\u201dThanks for the icePoor Jesse Sparks was late to cookbook club\u2014this month\u2019s pick was Yasmin Khan\u2019s Zaitoun\u2014at Carla Lalli Music\u2019s house last weekend because he aimed to make little spinach and feta parcels and ...things didn\u2019t turn out in the dough dept. \u201cI tried the windowpane test...over and over, it wasn\u2019t happening,\u201d he sighed. He brought ice for our wine instead. Thanks, Jesse! (Sorry, Yasmin!) I was also late, making fried onions for my mujadarra, but it was worth it. Julia Kramer stole the show with her pan-baked lamb kibbeh, and Alex Pastron ended things on a sweet note with a custardy fig and almond tart (above). And then we got to take home tahini chocolate chip cookies, made by Carla. To make any of these fantastic recipes, though, you\u2019ll need to buy the cookbook!Unnecessary food meme of the weekUnnecessary food feud of the weekIt\u2019s been around 94 degrees in my hometown of Houston, and that\u2019s snow cone weather. We had a snow cone shack in my neighborhood that made a wedding cake flavor, doused in condensed milk. That\u2019ll do it for me. But not my colleagues, who feel that snow cones can melt in hell (where they would melt very quickly according to my sources). \u201cIt\u2019s not a good eating experience,\u201d said measured Meryl Rothstein, \u201cyou suck the syrup out and you\u2019re left with ice!\u201d \u201cYou might as well drink straight syrup,\u201d added Sarah Jampel, who prefers sno-balls, the New Orleans version made with finely shaved ice (more syrup-absorbent) in flavors like ambrosia. \u201cNo one has eaten a snow cone and not had sticky hands after,\u201d complained Alex Delany. \u201cThat paper cup is BULLSHIT!\u201d On the other, non-sticky hand, \u201cit\u2019s nostalgic for me,\u201d said pro-snow Emily Schultz. Hilary Cadigan nodded along, \u201cI\u2019m never going to argue with their right to exist.\u201d Elyse Inamine and Jesse Sparks teamed up in favor of Hawaiian shave ice, or \u201cany Asian ice, because they all have milk products in them, which makes them soooo good,\u201d said Elyse, who proceeded to list a few off the top of her head: \u201ckakig\u014dri, the Japanese kind that\u2019s like a mound; bingsoo, the Korean kind with lots of beans and stuff; bao bing, Taiwanese shave ice...\u201dExplore Bon App\u00e9titBeggs NewsletterRead MorecultureWhat the BA Staff Is Cooking on Memorial DayBy Alex BeggscookingAjo Blanco Is the Sauce You Didn\u2019t Know You Were MissingBy Emma WartzmancultureIs It Ever Okay...To Take Over the Grilling at Someone Else\u2019s Party?By Alex BeggscultureThe Best Etsy Stores for Hunting Vintage PyrexBy Alex BeggsRecipes you want to make.
