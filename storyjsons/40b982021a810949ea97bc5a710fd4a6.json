If you can\u2019t find cherry tomatoes, any larger ones will work just as well for this summery pasta sauce recipe. Simply cut them into pieces about the size of cherry tomatoes and proceed.Ingredients4 servings\u00bdcup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling6garlic cloves, smashed4pints cherry tomatoes (about 2\u00bd lb.)\u00betsp. crushed red pepper flakes2large sprigs basil, plus 1 cup basil leaves, torn if large1\u00bdtsp. kosher salt, plus morePinch of sugar (optional)12oz. campanelle or other tube pasta1oz. finely grated Parmesan (about \u2153 cup), plus more for servingPreparationStep 1Heat \u00bd cup oil in a large heavy pot over low.

Cook, stirring to coat, until tomatoes begin to burst, about 4 minutes. Smash some but not all of the tomatoes with the back of a wooden spoon to help create a sauce, then continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until a chunky, thickened sauce comes together and about half the tomatoes are completely broken down and half remain in tact, 10\u201312 minutes. Taste and adjust seasoning, adding sugar if sauce seems tart. Pluck out and discard basil sprigs.Photo by Chelsie Craig, Food Styling by Anna BillingskogStep 2Meanwhile, cook pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water, stirring occasionally, until al dente.

Of course I had to make this recipe for lunch! It is so easy - by the time the pasta is done, the sauce is done as well. Toss them together and voila, the perfect pasta. Tangy, sweet, savory, umami. I keep wanting to eat more but had to pace myself - carbo load! AnonymousVancouver, BC3/11/2022Very good!  I made a smaller portion so I used grape tomatoes and 4oz. Tomato sauce and 1/2 tsp. Of sugar.   I did smash them all.  Otherwise I followed recipe.  I love fresh basil but next time I will use a little less.  Romano cheese of course.  AnonymousOmaha NE1/11/2022My family loved this I added shrimp in close to the end and dished it over a bed of linguini.

I have made it countless times over the past 2 months and probably will do so for months to come. It is easy, fast and very satisfying. Thank you!!AnnStratford, Ont6/28/2021I don't usually leave reviews for recipe but this tomato pasta is toooo good that I HAVE to give it a credit and show my appreciation! AliceTaiwan3/20/2021This is such a nice recipe - light flavours that really stand out individually. It is best with cherry tomatoes right from the garden but when I don't have enough I use a mix of home grown and either a 400g tin of diced tinned tomatoes, or some shop bought cherry tomatoes. I throw in a bit more garlic and lots and lots of basil because my plants are prolific, as well as a pinch of brown sugar if it needs it. A half tsp of powdered beef stock adds some depth as well.Anonymous1/30/2021Amazing with Late late summer tomatoes and basil. AnonymousDurham, NC10/18/2020We made this for the second time.  It's incredible and so easy.  We did add a little pasta water and it became very creamy.  A great way to use a variety of different color \"tiny\" tomatoes from the farmers market.AnonymousChicago area10/16/2020LOVE this recipe. I've made it twice already and it's incredibly easy and super flavorful. AnonymousKansas City, MO10/11/2020While I get that most recipes are slight variations of others it\u2019s interesting that this recipe is almost an exact copy of one in the six seasons cookbook by Joshua McFadden. Perhaps you could say he influenced you in your recipe instead of just taking is almost exactly and printing as your own. Anonymous9/25/2020This recipe is amazing. I didn't have all the cherry tomatoes it called for, so I subbed in some red and yellow bell peppers. Now I make it that way every time. Quick, easy and delicious!Diamonddeb12Richmond, IN9/15/2020Delish and super easy.  We used tomatoes and basil from the garden, vegan Kite ravioli for a bit of protein.AnonymousChicago, IL8/29/2020Loved this dish--so simple to make and easily vegan. I used casareccia pasta and it worked perfectly. I even had it for breakfast the next morning.AnonymousAUSTIN8/15/2020Explore Bon App\u00e9titPastaItalianEuropeanCherry TomatoTomatoVegetablePennePasta & NoodlesRigatoniSummerWeeknight MealsQuickEasyMainNut-FreeVegetarianSaut\u00e9DinnerRecipes you want to make.
