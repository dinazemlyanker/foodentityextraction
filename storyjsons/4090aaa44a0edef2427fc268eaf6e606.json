I\u2019ve cooked it on more occasions than I can count, and read it through even more times than that. And yet, for the life of me, I always manage to get some step wrong. I've mixed the lemon zest in with the sauce and not the crispy panko topping. I've chopped all the olives but none of the capers. I've put all the right herbs in all the wrong places. And on, and on, and on.But you know what? It. Doesn\u2019t. Even. Matter. This recipe for Linguine with Green Olive Sauce and Zesty Breadcrumbs is so good, even idiots like me can\u2019t screw it up.There\u2019s the sauce part: a deliciously herby, briny mix of Castelvetrano olives, anchovies, capers, parsley, and basil, a salty green slap straight to the face. And then there\u2019s the topping part: a zingy, crunchy medley of toasted panko, lemon zest, and dill that you\u2019ll want to take generous spoonfuls of and sprinkle all over your body (I mean...bowl). Those combine with hot pasta to create a dish that's fresh, satisfying, and simple, all while being so much more than the sum of its clearly interchangeable (whoops?) parts.This recipe first came out in 2015, just in time for peak summer, but I\u2019ve been making it all year round ever since\u2014and especially when all I want is something green to remind me of the warmer days ahead. I say go for it and get a little heavy handed with all your ingredients, because no one is going to complain about having more chunky goodness to swirl their pasta in (the recipe calls for linguine, but I like using spaghetti). Sure you'll find tons of green bits in all your tooth crevasses after you\u2019ve licked your plate clean, but when all the mouths at your dinner table look like they\u2019ve gathered moss, who really cares? I\u2019ve converted more than one self-professed olive hater with this dish, and everyone asks me to pass along the recipe on their way out the door.Sure: I\u2019ll send it to them. But, of course, only I know the secret to making it perfectly every time\u2014that is, to always mess up at least one thing.Get the recipe:Linguine with Green Olive Sauce and Zesty BreadcrumbsBursting with the big brash flavors of green olives, anchovies, and capers, this herbaceous pasta sauce isn't afraid to bite back.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titBasicallyNever FailOlivePastaBreadcrumbsRecipes you want to make.
