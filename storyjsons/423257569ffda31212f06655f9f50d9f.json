They order what they\u2019ve always ordered, what their parents ordered, what their grandparents did.\u201dBy Bret Anthony JohnstonJune 6, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Jason PageFacebookTwitterEmailThis is part of our series that celebrates America\u2019s Favorite Neighborhood Restaurants. We asked 80 of the most interesting people we know to reveal the local spots they love the most.Metaphorically speaking, Panjo\u2019s Pizza Parlor is at the corner of dead and dying. Across one street is a Toys \u201cR\u201d Us with a \u201cGoing Out of Business\u201d banner; across another is a vacant shopping mall. The space next to the restaurant is available for rent, the hollowed-out husk of what had been a RadioShack. And yet Panjo\u2019s\u2014a small business owned by a mom and pop and eight daughters\u2014is thriving.Established in 1964 in Corpus Christi, Texas, Panjo\u2019s is a low-lit and beautiful relic. There are long rows of picnic table seating, all benches and thick lacquer, every surface saloon brown and rubbed to a glossy patina over decades of dining. Most of the walls are red and white cinder block, though one is mustard yellow with \u201ci LOVE my PANJOS!\u201d (sic) spray-painted in tall letters. Beside the restrooms is a gumball machine offering trinkets and decals of an alarmingly young Jessica Simpson for a quarter. The staff\u2014most of whom wear tie-dyed Panjo\u2019s T-shirts\u2014announce orders for pickup through an ancient sound system that makes every word sound fuzzy and far away, as if in echo from years before.Ready for the oven.\nPhoto by Jason PagePanjo\u2019s is usually loud, a festive cacophony. Either a group has taken over an entire row of tables for a party\u2014birthdays, graduations, anniversaries, and retirements\u2014or fans are cheering for some Texas team playing on one of two televisions. Until his death a few years back, Bubba the Pianist held honest-to-God weekend sing-alongs. He\u2019d been a fixture at Panjo\u2019s since the Johnson administration. (There was a short-lived effort to bring in another musician after his death, but the staff quickly learned that Bubba was irreplaceable.) Children chase each other while their parents refill pitchers of beer. Nervous teenagers come in on first dates and watch through the glass as workers in the kitchen sprinkle a mixture of provolone and mozzarella cheese onto pizza dough. Beachcombers arrive in tank tops and sandals, dragging in the scent of salt water and sunscreen, and strike up conversations with folks ahead of them in line, ranchers in sweat-stained Stetsons or bankers with Rolexes. Everyone eats off paper plates.Check out that cinder block.\nPhoto by Jason PageVery few people ever touch the laminated menus. They order what they\u2019ve always ordered, what their parents ordered, what their grandparents did. Because like most everything else at Panjo\u2019s, the menu hasn\u2019t really changed in almost 60 years: pizza, burgers and sandwiches, a few salads, beer and soda on tap, sweet tea made that morning. Each pizza is made to order. The sauce is thick, and the staff is stunningly liberal with toppings. Panjo\u2019s does do a deep-dish pie, but what keeps customers loyal for generations are the thin-crust pizzas. Crisp, buttery, perfect. It\u2019s all in the ovens. They\u2019re the original Bakers Pride models that were in the restaurant when it opened\u2014heavy ceramic slate and gas-driven. The cornmeal-dusted crust has an extra crunch to it, a texture that customers never forget and can\u2019t find anywhere else.It's all in the ovens.\nPhoto by Jason PageSo you come back. You come to remember your nervous first dates and loud graduation parties, to reminisce with friends and family, to raise a glass to Bubba and others you\u2019ve lost since their last visit. You talk about your jobs and health, your successes and struggles, the countless ways the world outside this old restaurant seems less and less recognizable. But inside Panjo\u2019s, things seem familiar, safe, good. The saloon-brown benches, the gumball machine, the family behind the counter are all as you remembered. And so when your number is called\u2014through a fuzzy speaker, in echo from years ago\u2014you can believe, if only for a moment, that time will spare you too.Bret Anthony Johnston is the Director of the Michener Center for Writers and the author of the international bestseller Remember Me Like This.ContentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Explore Bon App\u00e9titNeighborhood RestaurantsTexasRecipes you want to make.
