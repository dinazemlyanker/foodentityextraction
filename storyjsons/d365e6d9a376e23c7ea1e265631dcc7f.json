You\u2019re unfolding your picnic blanket to lay down in the freshly cut grass. You connect to your Bluetooth speaker and put on the highly-curated Park Playlist you made just for this occasion. One by one, your friends come join you, each bringing something. A crudit\u00e9s platter, perhaps? A savory fruit salad? As they crack open the cheap beer they just snagged at the bodega and pour it into their mason jars (this is a no plastic picnic), you pull something out. It\u2019s in an unassuming growler. No, it\u2019s not a hopped lager with brettanomyces yeast aged in oak barrels\u2014it\u2019s a funky-tart mixture of grapefruit and pickled ginger juice, and it\u2019s going to turn your beer into the most fabulous and park-appropriate shandy you\u2019ve ever had.Let\u2019s all identify the elephant in the room, and that elephant is that shandies are usually...not good. (In case you missed the boat, shandies are a combination of light beer and some kind of juicy, non-alcoholic thing, often lemonade. Most of the time people mix them themselves, over ice, but pre-mixed and bottled versions\u2014which are fully disgusting\u2014have been all over the place in the last few years.) It\u2019s the \"beer\" your uncle who non-ironically wears dad jeans and socks with sandals pulls out at his summer BBQs. They taste like a watered-down versions of the powdered lemonade you grew up making for lemonade stands, mixed with a weak-sauce lager. Sign me the opposite of up. But! That\u2019s why it's sweet that we are big cool adults who can make their own ACTUALLY TASTY shandy recipe now!The first time I had this mouth-puckering concoction was at Basically editor Amiel Stanek\u2019s house when we were all over for brunch. We were all very much hungover. He filled tall glasses with ice, poured in a big splash of a combination of grapefruit juice, pickled ginger, and lots of black pepper, and then filled them the rest of the way with the cheap beer we had brought over. As we all sipped on this punchy hair-of-the-dog, we were suddenly able to hold a conversation and enjoy the daylight. It\u2019s just what we needed.Now is not the time for fancy barrel-aged beers\u2014when you're making this shandy recipe, keep it light, and keep it cheap.\nMatt DuckorAfter discovering this perfect brunch cocktail, I decided this was a good formula for all day drinking activities. Diluting an already low ABV drink would ensure a picnic that didn\u2019t end in bad decisions or naptime. Because I was taking this to go, I made it in a beer growler, but by all means make it in a pitcher for your in-home brunch party too!I started by pouring grapefruit juice into the growler via a funnel. Then, I chopped up some pickled ginger, (also called sushi ginger if you\u2019re trying to locate it at a grocery store!), and poured some of the pickled ginger brine out to mix up with the grapefruit juice. I put a pinch of salt into the growler and cracked pepper into a small glass bowl to pour that into the growler. I tightly sealed it up with the lid and shook it up, rather than giving it the vigorous stir that Amiel suggests in the recipe (the neck of the growler was way too small to fit a spoon into). I packed it up in my cooler, brought it out to the picnic I was having with my friends, and enjoyed the day. No dad jeans, no bad shandies, and no blackout friends in sight.Get the Recipe:Spicy Grapefruit ShandyThis sweet-tangy mixture transforms even the cheapest beer into a refreshing party-worthy cocktail.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titCocktailNever FailBeerRecipes you want to make.
