Simple and the mustard gave the kick.HeikoGermany2/23/2022A great summer lunch! Shallot not necessary if not on hand. Leftovers go great on crackers the next day, and the dressing is good on anything!CharlotteLos Angeles, CA 7/9/2021This was a surprisingly awesome taste combination.  My husband practically licked out the bowl. The only change I made was to put in a medium-sized shallot that I saut\u00e9ed first because neither of us can handle raw onions.  Terrific.TugHillNativeRoy, Utah5/31/2021So good! I make this like weekly. AnonymousBrooklyn, NY4/7/2021This is the best tuna salad I have ever had.  It is so easy to make and a great change from the usual boring tuna salad.AnonymousPA4/1/2021This was excellent! Used a variety of farmer market greens\u2014butter head lettuce, green endive, and microgreens. Great, simple dinner.sbrooksh Takoma Park, MD3/16/2021Excellent \u2014 after some manipulation on my part. Great building blocks. Added sliced olives which were great as well as celery. Played quite a bit wth the dressing as it seemed a bit plain. Key was to also leave the tuna in biggish chunks. EssieDee Stamford ct3/16/2021I'm a massive fan of premium canned tuna just about every* way you can think of - classic tuna salad, stirred into hot pasta with olives and capers, Nicoise salad, the BA green goddess version - so I was excited to try this recipe.\n\nIt's superb! I had green endive so that's what I used, but that was better for me anyway as I often find red endive too bitter. I left out the pickled chiles because I didn't have them.\n\nMy only recommendation is to wait till the very end to stir in your tuna if you want it to stay in bigger chunks. I put it in halfway through as the recipe indicated and mine came out looking more like classic tuna salad heaped on greens with chickpeas. But I didn't mind at all from a taste/texture perspective, it was still fabulous.\n\nI'll absolutely make this again!\n\n*Not tuna casserole.KatieChattanooga, TN3/10/2021Ok, I\u2019m impressed. I\u2019m normally not a tuna girl, but this is so fresh, bright, savory, crunchy... it\u2019s amazing. Just do yourself a favor and try it. I added avocado cause I had some leftover and it fit right in. Dang... I\u2019m a tuna girl nowDallas, TX3/9/2021I didn't like endives before trying this, now I'm obsessed. I added some cumin to the chickpeas, complete game changer, this is definitely becoming a weekly lunchToasted NutsRomania3/9/2021What a great and simple recipe that lends itself to alterations. Just whipped this up on a whim during my lunch hour and made a few substitutions based on what I had. Subbed red onion for shallot, romaine leaves for endive, and dried oregano for parsley. Turned out so delicious and satiating. I really wish I had fresh herbs on hand (parsley, cilantro, etc.) and will definitely be making this again soon once I make a trip to the grocery.AnonymousColumbus, OH3/1/2021So easy, flavorful, and delicious. It is versatile to add your own spin on it too.  Love it, Andy.Katherine gChicago, IL2/27/2021Made this for a \"ladies who lunch\" birthday celebration, complete with champagne and it was a total hit!  Easy enough for every day, but elevated for any special occasion as well.DominiqueDenver, CO2/24/2021I can't believe how good this is for something so simple. I'm saving this one, definitely going to be a regular eat.Savannah B.Boise, ID2/24/2021Incredibly simple to make and incredibly flavorful. Truly one of the best renditions of tuna I've ever had. No question this will be added into the lunch mix.
