Now He\u2019s an \u201cInternational Pizza Consultant\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve order all the wrong equipment. I\u2019ve hired all the wrong people. I\u2019ve done everything wrong in the last 10 years. You hire me to eliminate that stuff.\u201dBy Elyse InamineMay 31, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailAlex LauFacebookTwitterEmail\u201cWelcome to the pizza dungeon,\u201d Anthony Falco says, as he leads me down concrete stairs to the kitchen of Bocce, a new thin-crust pizza-slinging restaurant smack in the middle of the Union Square Greenmarket in New York City.Falco, who you might know as the guy who put Roberta\u2019s on the map, left the legendary Brooklyn institution a few years ago and now he\u2019s doing what he does best: helping restaurateurs develop the ideal pizza for their concept and then moving on once his job is complete. A self-dubbed \u201cinternational pizza consultant,\u201d he\u2019s taking the skill, knowledge, and connections he\u2019s accrued in a decade of pizza-making and sharing it with anyone who wants to get into the pizza business. Since Falco started consulting at the end of 2015, he\u2019s been hired dozens of clients for six concepts all over the world, from Braz Elettrica in Sao P\u00e3olo to General Assembly in Toronto, and he\u2019s got at least six more in the works. But the dream isn\u2019t owning a restaurant that bears his name. \u201cThat\u2019s a nightmare for me. I never want to be a 100 percent sole chef and owner of anything again,\u201d Falco says. \u201cI\u2019m all about giving away pieces to people I like.\u201dStretching out the dough before it goes into the oven\nAlex LauAnd for Bocce, that means doing the research with partner Jason Leeds (research = eating at Pizzeria Beddia in Philadelphia), creating a pizza style (\u201cAmerican,\u201d straddling the line between extra-crisp bar pizza and foldable New York style), developing recipes, training staff, and fine-tuning everything during small friends-and-family events like today. Upstairs, Bocce has a breezy, courtyard-like feel, more windows than walls (and Greek columns\u2014it\u2019s inside a huge stone monument on the north end of the park); downstairs in the kitchen, it feels more and more like a humid public swimming pool. The unrelenting blast of the ovens beat down like the August sun and three food runners stand by the entrance, hands behind their back like lifeguards. Pizza lifeguards.Falco in front of the ovens\nAlex LauToday, Falco\u2019s wearing a white baseball cap with hot pink flecks he spray-painted himself that reads \u201cRad Times Pizza,\u201d his pizza lifestyle brand (more on that later). He glides over to the two squat Izzo ovens and swiftly moves a green pie, covered in curly pea tendrils and bitter spigarello thanks to the vendors above ground, from prep table into the oven. A few steps away, four cooks assemble pies as they come in at the pizza station. They joke with him, occasionally, though they seem a little on edge during their second night of preview dinners. Falco doesn\u2019t seem worried one bit.\u201cI\u2019ve ordered all the wrong equipment. I\u2019ve hired all the wrong people. I\u2019ve done everything wrong in the last 10 years,\u201d he says. \u201cYou hire me to eliminate that stuff.\u201d60 seconds pass, and Falco pulls out the pizza. It goes upstairs to Bocce\u2019s first few customers in for a sneak peek at the restaurant opening next week.Slicing the pizzas\nAlex LauFalco\u2019s first mistake came immediately after high school. Instead of enrolling in film school, Falco moved to Seattle in 1998 to start a web design company. (The same year as Google, he notes.) And he hated it. After four years he took off, traveling the world, where he realized his passion was food, not web design. He reminisced over the thick Sicilian pizzas he learned how to make from his Sicilian great-grandmother in Marlin, Texas. (Fun fact: Marlin is home to lots of Sicilian farmers due to the similar climate.)Falco with his starter\nAlex LauThis awakening led to Falco\u2019s next move, getting deep into frites in Seattle, where he opened a shop in 2003. He made 20-30 dipping sauces from scratch and learned that potatoes are best in summer, slightly crispy on the skin and creamy inside. \u201cIt let me get in this mindset of focusing on one thing, obsessing over it, and perfecting it,\u201d Falco says.Just around the corner from the frites shop was a legit Neapolitan joint from pizzaiolo Dino Santonicola, now at Cane Rosso in Texas. The nostalgic pies sent Falco into a mid-life-like crisis, though he was 25 years old, that went like this: \u201c\u2018Wait, what am I doing? I\u2019m not Belgian! Pizza\u2014it just clicked.\u201dFalco\u2019s first pizza tattoo\nAlex LauHe moved to New York City in 2007 and landed jobs at Pulino\u2019s and Vinegar Hill House\u2014and eventually a little pizza joint far off in Brooklyn called Roberta\u2019s. After developing frozen pizzas destined for Whole Foods, building the website, and designing T-shirts, all for Roberta\u2019s, he left in 2016. He wanted to meet new people, experiment with new projects, and wade into unknown territory again. Almost immediately, calls started coming, and life as an international pizza consultant began.\u201cPizza is such a dynamic food\u2014it\u2019s a hybrid between baking and cooking so you have to have this crazy person mentality,\u201d Falco says. \u201cBut then opening a restaurant adds exponential chaos, with developing the menu, working with the architects on the floor plan, buying equipment, and sometimes helping find a chef. I provide stability.\u201dTossing the dough\nAlex LauAfter he bounces out of Bocce, he\u2019s going to Brazil, Toronto, and eventually to Kuwait to help a restaurateur bring back Japanese-style pizza (Neapolitan pies with Japanese ingredients \u00e0 la Savoy in Tokyo). He\u2019s also working on a pizza-centric horror film for Rad Times Pizza. (To best explain the movement, Falco tells people to imagine you\u2019re back in the golden era of 1984 to 1992, where T&C stands for \u201cthin & crispy\u201d pizza and arcade games and acid wash rule again. That\u2019s Rad Times Pizza.)The finished pie\nAlex Lau\u201cPeople say I have a dream job because they think I travel the world, eating pizza all the time, but that\u2019s the worst part,\u201d Falco says. \u201cWhat makes it a dream job is the people I work with, young people starting in the industry, entrepreneurs who are pursuing their dreams, and chefs who are more talented than me.\u201dA freshly topped mushroom pizza jolts Falco back to the work ahead of him. Things are still quiet in the dank underground kitchen, but service jitters are creeping in as orders pick up. \u201cIt\u2019s for you,\u201d says a cook to Falco. \u201cTake her away.\u201dBecome a domestic pizza consultant with this cast-iron pizza recipe:Explore Bon App\u00e9titPizzaChefsRestaurants + TravelRead MorerestaurantsAfter Three Moves, A Cult Neapolitan Pizzeria Calls NYC HomeBy Anthony MangierirestaurantsThis Slice Shop Is Low-Key Milling Its Own GrainsBy Priya Krishnaculture8 Styles of Regional Pizza to Know, Love, and CherishBy Arthur BovinoRecipes you want to make.
