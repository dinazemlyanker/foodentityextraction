I love partaking in this gooey pastime at restaurants, but at home it\u2019s a different story. A quick glance at the ingredient list on a jar of grocery-store queso is enough to make me jump back in terror. Just what exactly is \u201csodium hexametaphosphate?\u201d Recently I found a queso brand with ingredients I can get behind that also tastes amazing, but there\u2019s one catch: It has zero cheese. I\u2019m talking about vegan queso, specifically Siete\u2019s Spicy Blanco cashew queso, and I\u2019m obsessed.Austin-based brand Siete was launched in 2014 after Veronica Garza could no longer indulge in the foods of her Mexican-American heritage due to an autoimmune condition. After going grain-free to alleviate her symptoms, her six family members (mom and dad included) joined her in forgoing grains. Eventually, Garza got tired of lettuce wraps in lieu of tortillas and delved into the world of grain-free tortillas. \u201cShe got in the kitchen and solved her own problem by making a tortilla out of almond flour,\u201d says Miguel Garza, CEO and co-founder of Siete. \u201cWe all thought, \u2018Wow. This is actually really good.\u2019\u201dSiete\u2019s lineup began with grain-free tortillas and tortilla chips, but Veronica had been fiddling with a vegan queso recipe for years. \u201cWe grew up eating queso in our house. We ate it with tacos at breakfast and we would eat it with fajitas for dinner,\u201d says Miguel. While Veronica isn\u2019t vegan, she gave up dairy when she discovered that it\u2019s another inflammatory culprit. Miguel says, \u201cShe created this product to solve this problem of [wanting] the nostalgia of our heritage but in a way that conformed to our current dietary restrictions.\u201dThere are two varieties of queso, mild nacho and spicy blanco. Of the two, I prefer the blanco with its zesty flavor and rich, creamy texture. What\u2019s most impressive is how the ingredients are all whole, plant-based foods like cashews, tomatoes, bell pepper, onion, jalape\u00f1os, and coconut milk\u2014and yet somehow it all works together to create a \u201ccheesy\u201d dip.Pure bliss comes when you pop the queso in the microwave for a few seconds to warm it through, then get to dunking. Miguel likes to spread the queso over a tortilla and drizzle it with hot sauce. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like a quesadilla.\u201d He\u2019s also heard of customers drizzling it over mashed or roasted potatoes. And the milder nacho queso works well as a base for macaroni and cheese.So I say to vegans and non-vegans alike, embrace this spicy blanco queso. Not because it\u2019s dairy-free but because it\u2019s delicious and full of ingredients you actually want to eat.Buy it: Siete Foods Spicy Blanco Cashew Queso, $7.99All products featured on Healthyish are independently selected by our editors.
