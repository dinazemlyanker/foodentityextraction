Co-owner Frank Pellegrino Jr. gives us a peek through the hallowed red door.By Aliza AbarbanelApril 16, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by JONATHAN BECKERFacebookTwitterEmailWelcome to Red Sauce America, our coast-to-coast celebration of old-school Italian-American restaurants.Getting a seat at Rao\u2019s is like buying a time-share. Since 1896 the tiny Italian-American restaurant has been serving up family-style lemon chicken and seafood salad beneath strings of Christmas lights on a corner in East Harlem. But after New York Times food critic Mimi Sheraton gave it a three-star review in 1977, Rao\u2019s enacted a notoriously strict reservation system to preserve its devout community of regulars. Now table assignments are made in weekly, monthly, or annual increments, and only a rare few get inside. Forget being somebody\u2014you need to know somebody to get past co-owner Frank Pellegrino Jr. (His father, Frank Pellegrino Sr., was nicknamed Frankie No for his stalwart ability to turn away celebrities and regular folks alike.) After decades of gossip about what exactly goes on inside those red doors, we sat down with Frank Jr. to set the record straight.Rao's opened on this corner in East Harlem in 1896 (no, that's not a typo).\nPhoto by JOHNNY MILLER/Courtesy of Rao'sJust getting a table at Rao\u2019s is tough enough. How does someone manage to get their photo on the wall?Regulars will bring in someone who is notable and then it\u2019s a matter of, \u201cHey, send me a picture, sign it, and I\u2019ll put it up on the wall.\u201d People don\u2019t bring in photos as much as they used to, but they do send me electronic photos, and I print them out. We pay homage to the people up on the wall: We very rarely take down anyone\u2019s photo.Let\u2019s talk menu. Are all of the \u201cfamily\u201d recipes really from your family?That\u2019s one of the most beautiful things about the restaurant. Every dish is a family recipe that has been passed on from generation to generation, including the sauce that we sell in the markets. They all come from my Grandmother Paulina, Aunt Anna, and Uncle Vincent, and are recipes that were brought over from Italy. My dad and my aunt collaborated together on pretty much all the staple dishes, and now my chef Dino [Gatto] is involved. The recipes themselves evolve but their origins remain tried and true.Speaking of the Rao\u2019s jarred sauces, do you ever use them in the restaurant to save time?We always make the sauce at the restaurant fresh, but I can assure you it\u2019s the same recipe. Of course it\u2019s scaled different, but the mechanics are all the same. That recipe came from my great-grandmother, my aunt Anna, and my dad, and it changes over time. It\u2019s that same human touch\u2014I\u2019ll use the structure of the recipe but put a dash more salt or this much less oregano\u2014and it becomes a rhythm, a routine, second nature.These saucy meatballs, made from a mix of veal, beef, and pork, are just as iconic as Rao's red doors.\nPhoto by JOHNNY MILLER/Courtesy of Rao'sHas the menu evolved?You have to be sensitive to what\u2019s going on in the marketplace and the palates of our guests. Scungilli [sea snails cut into pieces] isn\u2019t a big hit and I\u2019m happy about that because it\u2019s a big pain in the bottom to clean scungilli and put it in our seafood salad. But when I was younger, working as a waiter, if I didn\u2019t put scungilli in the seafood salad I would have cut my hands off.How much parm do you go through in a week?In Las Vegas alone (we opened there in 2006) we go through probably a wheel and a half to two wheels every ten days. It\u2019s about 84 pounds a wheel. I go through probably a wheel of parm a month in Los Angeles (opened in 2013), and in New York, almost the same. Of course we use other kinds of cheese too, like Locatelli and Pecorino Romano.Who gets to pick the music in the restaurant?We have a jukebox in every restaurant with a wonderful selection of music. Now the younger generation\u2014which is me (and which is not so young anymore)\u2014has expanded the spectrum. I have to honestly say that my favorite jukebox right now is the one in L.A. It\u2019s just dynamite. It covers everything: the Eagles, the Beatles, the Stones.What about the one at the original NYC location?Back in the day our jukebox was one of the most notable jukeboxes in the city of New York. It was all Motown, doo-wop, Sinatra, Rat Pack stuff, a lot of the classics, and programmed by a dear friend of my father\u2019s. That jukebox was the catalyst for two albums that my dad created; the first was called An Evening at Rao\u2019s, and it was part and parcel of our first cookbook launch in the \u201990s. It\u2019s comprised of 17 songs, one of which my father performs. It\u2019s called \u201cThe Ham (Le Cabotin).\u201dSettle a debate: What\u2019s the difference between gravy and sauce?Gravy is made with meat, like Sunday gravy. We actually do it in L.A. every Sunday, and it's a smashing success\u2014you have braciole, sausage, meatballs, short ribs that are braised for hours...an abbondanza of food. We do it occasionally as a special in New York and Vegas, but the feeding capacity in the restaurant in Vegas is close to 400 people so I\u2019d have to build a separate facility to do it regularly.Aliza Abarbanel is an assistant editor at Bon App\u00e9tit.Explore Bon App\u00e9titRestaurantsNew York CityItalian AmericanRed SauceRead MorerestaurantsRed Sauce AmericaBy Bon App\u00e9titRecipes you want to make.
