The quartered stalks are steamed with stir-fried garlic and shallot\u2014plus a little soy sauce for seasoning\u2014but if you don\u2019t have these alliums you could sub in scallions and half a red onion or whatever similar ingredients you have in the pantry or crisper drawer. Because it\u2019s fairly simple, this recipe opens itself up to all kinds of additions. Want to grate a knob of fresh ginger in with the garlic? Go for it. Drizzle on a little sesame oil to serve? Love it.Steaming the leafy greens allows their stalks to turn tender to the core without too much charring or drying out. When rinsing the bok choy, give it a good shake to dry, but don\u2019t worry if a little water still clings\u2014it\u2019ll help with the steaming. Serve this fast-and-furious side dish alongside any simply roasted meat or fish or with fried rice, a boiled egg, or chile crisp (a dish just as good for breakfast as it is for dinner).Looking for more easy bok choy recipe ideas?
