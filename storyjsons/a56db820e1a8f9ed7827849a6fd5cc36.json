The consistency of your final product will vary greatly depending on the nature of your fruit, like whether it\u2019s super juicy or how much pectin it contains. Embrace the variance (and follow your instincts!)\u2014it will taste great any which way. Mix and match the fruit and vinegar based on what sounds good to you and what you have on hand (maybe it\u2019s plums and unseasoned rice vinegar, nectarines and sherry vinegar, or apricots and Champagne vinegar).All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Does the author or anyone out there know whether there is any reason why I couldn't make this in a larger quantity and home-can it for a longer shelf life?AnonymousSt. Louis, MO8/15/2021This has changed my breakfast routine forever.  A topping for overnight oats is the hands-down favorite of everyone in my family.  But it's also good on yogurt, warm oatmeal and cream of wheat.  I've done just plums, plums and cherries, just cherries...\nIt's the perfect blend of sweet, tart and fruity.
