Take roasted broccoli: It's one of our go-to winter staples, but it definitely needs some zhuzhing to take our attention away from, say, baked pasta.Luckily, senior food editor Chris Morocco developed a roasted broccoli recipe that\u2019s going to keep our attention all season long. The weeknight-friendly recipe dunks blanched broccoli in a vibrant yogurt marinade fortified with warm spices like hot paprika, coriander, and turmeric. The yogurt tenderizes the tough broccoli florets while they cook, and, thanks to the dairy and spice-combo,  the broccoli develops a delicious, almost cheese-like crust. It's not not reminiscent of a nacho cheese Dorito, and it's much more delicious than broccoli is normally allowed to be.The first secret to creating craveable broccoli is blanching the florets. This process isn\u2019t totally mandatory, but it helps break down the fibrous vegetables so that they\u2019ll roast faster and become more tender. Just blanch the broccoli in a small pot of boiling salted water until its bright green (which should only take 30 seconds or so). Trust us, you\u2019ll be glad you did.The other key is to create layers of flavor in your yogurt marinade. Morocco opted for a base of hot paprika, ground coriander, and ground turmeric, then added a finely grated garlic clove and a few dashes of hot sauce for a hint of heat. Feel free to experiment with other additions like garam masala or fresh ginger. No matter your flavor profile, be sure to thoroughly toss the broccoli in the yogurt marinade to ensure an even coating. Then roast on a foil-lined baking sheet to save yourself some cleanup. Nobody likes scrubbing roasted yogurt off a sheet tray.Once the broccoli is browned and the stalks are tender, it\u2019s time to serve. I used my broccoli to top a chickpea-quinoa grain bowl, adding a generous dusting of nutritional yeast to double down on the cheesy flavor. After a week of holiday parties (and holiday cookies), it felt good to eat something green. And two helpings of broccoli later, my rugelach equilibrium was rebalanced.Get ready to marinate:Yogurt and Spice Roasted BroccoliYour roasted broccoli recipe could use an upgrade.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishYogurtBroccoliSideRead MorecookingButternut Squash Baked Pasta Is the Ultimate Healthy Winter Comfort FoodBy Andy BaraghaniRecipes you want to make.
