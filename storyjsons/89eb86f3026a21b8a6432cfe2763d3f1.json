Morisano, Black, White, and The Grey, Mashama Bailey explores the joy and pain of opening a restaurant and delivers this irresistible recipe for lemony, crispy wings. These wings, inspired by the Greek wings at Bailey\u2019s local bar, Crystal Beer Parlor, require at least two hours to marinate, so make sure you plan accordingly.Ingredients4 ServingsWingsZest and juice of 1 lemon6garlic cloves, crushed\u00bdcup extra-virgin olive oil1Tbsp. cracked black pepper2tsp.

It's so delicious. We cut out the the oil coating last step, tbh. We felt like it didn't add enough to make the effort worth it. Don't skip the feta though. With or without the oil coating, the a bite of feta with each wing is what makes this dish stand out.erikaAustin, TX10/4/2021Awful, seriously? heating virgin olive oil? throw in some garlic and lemon zest and call it Greek. I'm embarrassed that I went along with  cooking this as far as I did. What is the deal with Google nowadays? Very dysfunctional algorisms.AnonymousBoston MA9/22/2021Seriously this has become my go-to marinade for chicken!  That being said, I have also used it for shrimp (only marinated one (1) hour though as to not have lemon juice cook the shrimp).  Grilled the shrimp - unbelievably good!  Andress BlackwellNew Orleans7/28/2021These wings were so delicious! I bought chicken drumsticks from Costco thinking I would have leftovers. but they were so good, I didn't end up having any left overs. I followed the recipe as is, but had my husband grill them instead and they were fantastic. We served them with shishito peppers and arugula salad.BrookeSan Clemente, CA6/28/2021Totally agree with all other reviewers - this is amazing, and I don't even like wings, as a rule!!! Not sure what attracted me to this recipe, but sure glad I tried it - what a nice change of pace in chicken dinners. Marinated over 2 hrs, but next time, will attempt to go longer, like overnight, for all the flavors to be absorbed and might even try fresh oregano.  My oven runs pretty true, so only took about 10 more minutes to brown and crisp up when I upped the heat to 425. Didn't have quite enough lemon for the dressing, so used a lemon infused EVOO (but forgot the seasonings) and served with a small greek salad. Next time, will try on the grill and maybe add some pita or something else to sop up that great sauce! Plan to make over the summer (when it finally arrives in the great PNW) for a light but flavorful dinner!Lia FinneyCoupeville, WA4/17/2021OMG!!!!!!  These are awesome.  I used goat cheese instead of feta.  I used my air fryer @400F for 40 minutes, with the drumlets on top (closer to heating element, 30 min.), swapped tray for last 10 minutes.  They looked burnt, but they weren\u2019t. Added dressing and crumbled goat cheese. It vanished. I served it with a lime coated cucumber and cilantro salad.  Perfect. NLasiukWaukesha, WI3/25/2021We made this for the NCAA Georgetown-Colorado game. Results of the game were disappointing, but these wings were a winner. They were super easy to prepare and serve. We used fresh chicken wings and next time I'll experiment with frozen. I'd definitely make this again and wouldn't change anything. YazBeanSaysMeowAlexandria, VA3/20/2021I\u2019ve made this 4 times since seeing the recipe, once with thighs. This is going to be on permanent rotation at my house, it\u2019s really spectacular. I make it with smitten kitchen oven fries so I can dip the fries in the leftover wing sauce! (Note- I sub the parsley for dill, as I prefer dill and don\u2019t usually have parsley in the house anyway.)KellyBethesda, MD3/6/2021These were a huge hit. Tweaked the recipe a bit to add a generous squeeze of hot honey to the dressing, which gave the wings a beautiful tang. Next time I'll also decrease the oil from 1/3 cup to 2 tbsp in the dressing bc the recommended amount was too much.AnonymousNew York, NY2/21/2021OMG. This recipe is so delicious, I made a couple of changes that elevated the recipe:\n\n1. Use chicken thighs\n2. Marinate overnight \n3. Coat chicken with falafel mix (Trader Joe's) before putting it in the oven\n\nAnd served with sweet potato fries with feta & garlic yogurt dip on the side. Bomb meal!AnonymousBrooklyn, NY2/19/2021These were ridiculously delicious.  I typically don't eat chicken wings, but wanted some type of diversion for Super Bowl.  I will definitely be making these again - soon!   I did take the reviewer's suggestion and give this a little more cooking time - 20 min at the end at 425.  Made them so nice and crispy.  KarinSan Clemente, CA2/8/2021Agree with all previous reviews, really good and really, really easy.  The final sauce really does the trick, the paprika adds a really nice warmth to the dish.AnonymousArlington Heights, IL2/7/2021Amazing!  Just about to make them for the second time (in two days I might add!)RoseVancouver Island BC2/3/2021It gives me untold joy to imagine that somewhere in Georgia Mashama Bailey is cooking in her kitchen while I am trying out one of her recipes in our cottage here in Louisiana. This recipe is ridiculous. RIDICULOUS. I followed all the steps to the tee, marinated for 6 hours, and had them in the oven 1hr15 minutes before our close friends arrived for dinner. What makes these wings indescribable is the dressing you toss them in at the end. The acid from the lemon and the cayenne turn the brightness wayyyyyy up and it's salted perfectly. What I did notice: 375F for my oven was a little too low, they weren't browning at a nice pace, so I baked them for 375F for 50 minutes to cook them through and then turned my oven up to 425F for the last 25 minutes, turning them just as instructed. Big FanNew Orleans, Louisiana. 2/3/2021We loved these wings!  They're super flavorful and were a great addition to a mezze style dinner!  They'll definitely become part of our regular rotation...and would be a fun thing to build a Greek dinner party around!
