It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.Make a huge pieThis week, I shilled for the deep dish pie dish. What\u2019s to lose? $8! What\u2019s to gain? A big, fruit-stuffed pie. I want to master apple pie this summer, even if it\u2019s not in season. I play the long game. I\u2019m preparing for the holidays. I\u2019m using Claire Saffitz\u2019s recipe as a starting point, but probably tweaking the filling to make it...easier on myself. Her crust though, I follow to a T. Rick Martinez\u2019s blueberry pie recipe is another stunner and I hear it has a love potion effect (I HEAR). You\u2019ve got options.Gloria Vanderbilt in Vogue, 1961.\nPhoto by Horst P. HorstGloria Vanderbilt\u2019s favorite lunchFive years ago, I was lucky enough to interview Gloria Vanderbilt, who died this week at age 95. I was a big fan, especially of her paintings and collages and joie de vivre. She told me that every day she took a break from painting for lunch and every day she ate the same thing. A peanut butter and jelly sandwich, with a glass of milk. All of her life\u2019s incredibly high highs and deeply low lows, loves and loss, wealth and debt, seemed tucked into that homey, comforting sandwich. When we brush off our gold-plating, we\u2019re all PB&J underneath.Want this letter before it hits the website? Sign up for our newsletter!CoincidentallyAnother celebrity food quirk. In my outlaws\u2019 house in Detroit, I read a back issue of AARP Magazine that featured a short but powerful interview with Alan Cumming in which he reveals he loves soup and eats it twice a day. \u201cIf it\u2019s water and got vegetables in it, I\u2019m in,\u201d he said. Well.The garlic videoWe learned our lesson when the viral video clip of slicing pineapple a whole new way didn\u2019t ultimately turn out. So when we watched the garlic-peeling video this week, we groaned and declared: It\u2019ll never work. At least, not in the way we want it to. There are 45 different gadgets to help man conquer garlic. But garlic knows.Photo by Alex Lau, food styling by Susie TheodorouSomething to do with a ton of garlicMake these roast chicken legs.Hello cousin TimMy cousin Tim texted me this week because he wanted to know why I wasn\u2019t in Chris Morocco\u2019s doughnut video, which I hadn\u2019t even watched yet. It turns out, I play a small role, an international woman of mystery, who sprints off-camera to avoid being immortalized on YouTube. I prefer to live in the shadows! But the doughnuts, made with Greek yogurt, have this moist, incredible crumb and tangy lemon glaze, are pure sunshine. Make them!Get the recipe: Lemony Glazed Cake DoughnutsOut of the shadows\u201cHave you heard about our barley?\u201d I went to an event for a new Macallan expression this week that I thought was going to be another press tasting full of writers wafting and sniffing and spitting and saying the word \u201cnose.\u201d Instead, it was an immersive experience in a $13 million mansion on Riverside Drive (for sale\u2014snagged a real estate one-sheet in the lobby, no pool). People were wearing stilettos, by choice, which always shocks me. The barley, by the way, is grown on the Macallan estate and is harvested for one week, once a year. In the \u201cbarley field activation\u201d of the mansion, though, it was fake, stuck into foam hillscapes you could take a photo in front of while a soundtrack of chirping birds played. That\u2019s harvested year-round, at Michael\u2019s.The sweaty meat carverDid I watch a 10-minute meat carving training video for Old Country Buffet this week? Maybe! Have you tried the lasagna? It\u2019s my favorite.Unnecessary food meme of the weekUnnecessary food feud of the weekAliza Abarbanel wrote about her love for this ros\u00e9 sangria recipe on Basically this week (\u201cit\u2019s vegetal!\u201d), but not everyone at BA can get down with fruit salad wine punch. \u201cEverything sangria thinks it is doing well, a Pimm\u2019s cup does better,\u201d declared Chris Morocco. \u201cThere\u2019s no instance in which I\u2019d rather have sangria than wine,\u201d said Emma Wartzman. \u201cIf a spritz exists,\u201d posed Alex Delany, \u201cthen what\u2019s the point of sangria?\u201d Jesse Sparks, waving a mug of tea around, wasn\u2019t here for the negativity. \u201cI love the stuff. You can make it with friends\u2014remember those? They LOVE SANGRIA. It\u2019s ridiculously easy, and big batch-able.\u201d Carla Lalli Music is down for sangria too. \u201cThe brandy, the fruit, I can put some sangria away,\u201d she said, before adding, \u201cNO grapes.\u201d A feud-within-a-feud! Ryan Walker-Hartshorn declared she is pro-grapes in sangria, \u201cand I cut them in half individually,\u201d she said, \u201cthat\u2019s love.\u201d Emily Schultz interjected that her \u201cfriend has some Ed Hardy sangria in her apartment,\u201d which is knowledge I\u2019ll have to live with the rest of my life. Andy Baraghani sent me his order: \u201cIdeally it would be some stone fruit (not cut into stupid cubes but thin wedges), a handful of lightly bruised basil (maybe mint), a touch of brandy, a bit of orange and lemon peel that has been muddled with a spoonful of sugar, and wine.\u201d Would drink. Adam Rapoport likes white sangria, where all the ingredients are on display\u2014peaches, citrus\u2014but not murky, mysterious red sangria, where \u201cyou don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on in there, it could be Sierra Mist for all I know.\u201d Could it?Explore Bon App\u00e9titBeggs NewsletterRead Moreculture23 Date-Friendly Foods, According to MeBy Alex BeggscultureIs It Ever Okay...To Take Over the Grilling at Someone Else\u2019s Party?By Alex BeggscultureThe Best Etsy Stores for Hunting Vintage PyrexBy Alex BeggscultureA Fond Farewell to Our Wonderful AmielBy Alex BeggsRecipes you want to make.
