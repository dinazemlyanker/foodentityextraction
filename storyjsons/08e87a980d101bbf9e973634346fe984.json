She requested plain cream cheese, lox, tomatoes, red onion, and capers on a CINNAMON RAISIN BAGEL. In her words: \u201ca full load.\u201dNew Yorkers, raging Internet commenters, and most of the BA staff reacted in horror. \u201cOh no. It\u2019s like her version of the Howard Dean scream,\u201d said Basically editor Amiel Stanek, going on to add, \u201cDo you think Cuomo orchestrated the whole thing?\u201d \u201cThis is honestly illegal,\u201d said associate social media manager Emily Schultz, \u201cI\u2019m calling the police.\u201d Senior social media manager Rachel Karten kept it short and sweet: \u201cI am nauseous.\u201d Nixon defended her bagel choice, telling reporter Jimmy Vielkind, \u201cDon\u2019t knock it \u2018til you try it.\u201d So we did.\u201cIf the first time I had a cream cheese and lox bagel it was served like this, I wouldn't question it. But growing up eating other bagel combinations, yeah, it\u2019s a little weird.\u201d \u2014Alex Delany, associate editor\u201cI wouldn't ORDER it, but if it showed up on my desk, for free, like it did today, I\u2019d eat the whole thing. It\u2019s not bad, people. The smoky lox overshadows the sweetness of the bagel\u2014sort of like this news overshadows the larger issues at stake\u2014only a little cinnamon comes through. Politics are weird.\u201d \u2014Alex Beggs, senior editor\u201cThis is the only way you will ever convince me to eat a cinnamon raisin bagel without gagging.\u201d \u2014Christina Chaey, associate editor\u201cThe warm spices of the cinnamon raisin WITH the onions and capers is very strange. It\u2019s like if a toddler decided to make me a bagel sandwich. But it was not disgusting, defying my expectations.\u201d  \u2014Elyse Inamine, digital restaurant editorWe got ours from the Tribeca bagel shop, Zucker\u2019s.\nPhoto by Emily Schultz\u201cI think it\u2019s about time we let go of our cinnamon raisin bagel baggage. There\u2019s nothing wrong with the bagel itself, people just use it to do questionable things. This bagel order is certainly that: questionable, but not an atrocity.\u201d \u2014Jesse Sparks, editorial assistant\u201cA cinnamon raisin bagel with cream cheese and lox (excluding capers, onions, and tomatoes) is my go-to bagel order. It has the delightful combination of sweet and salty that I crave on a weekend morning, especially after I\u2019ve gone on a long run and my body is craving salt (lox), carbs (bagel), and a little something sweet (raisin).\u201d\u2014Elaheh Nozari, e-commerce editor\u201cI was really hungry. It tasted fine? Better than I thought it would, but I thought it would taste really bad, so that\u2019s not saying too much. I spent the whole time wishing the raisins weren\u2019t there.\u201d \u2014Emma Wartzman, editorial assistant\u201cIt grows on you. If someone accidentally gave this to me instead of my typical everything with smoked salmon, I wouldn\u2019t throw it away, but I also wouldn\u2019t be happy.\u201d\u2014Alyse Whitney, associate editor\u201cWould it be fair to call it a progressive bagel for a progressive candidate? It\u2019s still a bagel so it\u2019s not terrible, but it\u2019s a bad bagel. I won\u2019t order it again.\u201d\u2014Aliza Abarbanel, editorial assistant, Healthyish\u201cI did not understand why everyone was so upset about this because I knew it would be good before I even tried it, and I was correct. It brings me the same sweet-savory joy as a chocolate-covered pretzel but with the added depth of fishiness + creaminess + cinnamony-ness. Live your dreams, Cynthia. Break us free from the chains of tradition.\u201d \u2014Hilary Cadigan, associate editorIf you live in New York, don\u2019t forget to vote on Thursday, September 13. Then go get a bagel.Explore Bon App\u00e9titTrends + NewsRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
