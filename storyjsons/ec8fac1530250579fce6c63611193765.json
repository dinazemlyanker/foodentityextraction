The eight-episode series explores how different people make and eat things like pizza, barbecue, fried chicken, and tacos, but doesn\u2019t rely on gratuitous shots of gorgeous food. Instead, Chang lets chefs\u2019 tell the stories of their favorite dishes, no matter how \u201cugly\u201d\u2014including April Bloomfield, Sqirl\u2019s Jessica Koslow, Massimo Bottura, and Wolfgang Puck. He also dines around various cities with comedians like Jimmy Kimmel, Ali Wong, and Nick Kroll to see food through their eyes.ContentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.In an exclusive clip from the series\u2019 third episode \u201cHome Cooking,\u201d Chang shares the meaning behind the show\u2019s name. \u201cHome cooking, or [what] I call \u2018ugly delicious\u2019 food has now become the food I also want to make in the restaurant. There\u2019s a way to coax more out of a dish.\u201d He calls the spicy braised cod dish \u201cone of the ugliest dishes I\u2019ve ever made\u201d in the clip above. It\u2019s a donabe filled with a \u201cpeasant dish of potatoes, peppers, and fish.\u201d There are no fancy garnishes\u2014it\u2019s basically a pile of peppers with fish on top, served in the vessel it\u2019s cooked in. Chang has never been shy about mixing cuisines at his restaurants\u2014in this case, Portuguese, Korean, and Szechuan-style. \u201cIf you try to respect these cultures you can figure out how to merge them together without bastardizing any of it,\u201d he explains.This is Chang\u2019s version of \u201cugly delicious\u201d: spicy cod stew cooked with sweet potatoes and mung bean noodles.\nCourtesy of NetflixThe point of Ugly Delicious is to show how different people \u201cuse food as a vehicle to break down cultural barriers, tackle misconceptions and uncover shared experiences.\u201d The \u201cHome Cooking\u201d episode is most exemplary of that, showing Chang making Galbi (Korean short ribs) with his mother on Thanksgiving. Snippets of how different chefs translate restaurant cooking to their own homes is intriguing\u2014Chef Ren\u00e9 Redzepi and his wife, Chef Nadine Levy Redzepi throw a dinner party for Chang and his wife, Grace, that rivals anything you could get a Noma. Although Chang may playfully call this food \u201cugly,\u201d the stories are beautifully told. If you plan to binge the series, maybe put some of Momofuku\u2019s bo ssam braised pork in the oven before you queue up the first episode... and make some backup snacks. There\u2019s no way you\u2019ll get through 10 minutes without getting hungry for something\u2014whether it\u2019s ugly delicious or not.Stream Ugly Delicious on Netflix beginning February 23.Learn more about David Chang\u2019s Momofuku empire:Explore Bon App\u00e9titDavid ChangNetflixPop CultureRead MorecultureLet David Chang Take You on a Korean Food Tour for the OlympicsBy Evelyn WangcultureEpisode 14: David Chang, Momofuku (and Maple) MaestroBy Bon App\u00e9titcultureWhat's New on Netflix in December\u2014and 5 Things to Eat While WatchingBy Alyse Whitneyculture8 TV Shows That Are Secretly About FoodBy Alyse WhitneyRecipes you want to make.
