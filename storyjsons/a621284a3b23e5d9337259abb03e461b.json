Here, we toss the bread in garlic brown butter before baking in the oven.IngredientsMakes about 4 cups6oz. country-style bread, torn into 1\" irregular pieces (about 4 cups)10garlic cloves, smashed4Tbsp. unsalted butterKosher salt, freshly ground pepperPreparationStep 1Preheat oven to 375\u00b0. Place bread in a large bowl. Cook garlic and butter in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat, swirling often, until foaming subsides, butter turns golden brown, and garlic is fragrant, 6\u20138 minutes. Drizzle garlic butter over bread and toss to coat; season with salt and pepper.Step 2Spread out bread mixture on a small rimmed baking sheet. Bake croutons until deep golden brown and crisp, 20\u201325 minutes. Let cool, then pluck out and discard garlic cloves.Step 3Do Ahead: Croutons can be made 1 week ahead.
