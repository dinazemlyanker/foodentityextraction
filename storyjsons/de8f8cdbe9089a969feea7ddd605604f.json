The day\u2019s eight dishes depend on what\u2019s growing in Denmark right that second, which could mean carrots and roses with a chilled shrimp sauce or potatoes with smoked egg yolk and caviar. If you\u2019re on a budget or can\u2019t get a table, the attached coffee bar-wine-bar-mini-restaurant, The Corner at 108, is a marvel of culinary and coffee-geek excellence. Here, you\u2019ll find coffee kombucha\u2013brushed pastries; small plates of lamb tartare with smoked egg sauce; grilled lamb belly with asparagus; and stellar wine and beer, not to mention coffee beans from superstar Tim Wendelboe.THE VIBE IS: Noma 1.5. The light, airy space feels fresh and relaxed, despite the attention that has gone into every detail. In summer, sit on the patio and toast the late sunset with a glass of natural wine.PRACTICAL STUFF: Open for dinner every day, from 5 p.m. to midnight. You still need to book about a week in advance: The locals love this place too! Check the posters on the wall for upcoming winemaker and farmer dinners, as well as the weekly wine tasting and the beer happy hour every day.\u2014Christine MuhlkePhoto by Ditte IsagerWE ALSO LOVENomaThe next evolution of Ren\u00e9 Redzepi\u2019s destination restaurant in Refshale\u00f8enJuno the BakeryFuel up for those canalside bike rides with these outstanding \u00d8sterbro carbsBarabbaMake the most of your jet lag by staying up all night at this Indre By chefs\u2019 hauntExplore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
