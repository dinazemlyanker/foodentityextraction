This week: the homemade salsa recipe that BA.com senior editor Alex Beggs couldn\u2019t live without.There was a time for me when \u201chomemade salsa\u201d meant actually going to the trouble of transferring the contents of the Tostitos jar to a bowl. (Give me a break, my frontal lobe wasn\u2019t fully developed!) Growing up, our family parties came with homework assignments: everyone had to bring a very specific thing. Store-bought bread, cheese, plastic-wrapped pies. But my eyes widened when the aunt (I have like 17 aunts) who was in charge of chips, showed up with a can of Fritos\u2019 bean dip and a jar of rubbery queso.I\u2019d dip chip after chip in what is essentially cold refried beans and a million preservatives, plus \u201ccheese product,\u201d and then (probably) single-handedly powered the hot tub. \ud83d\ude44I\u2019ve come a long way since then. I\u2019ve learned how low-key easy it really is to make homemade refried beans if you have time and lard; I\u2019ve nailed Velveeta-less queso. But my real party trick is this homemade salsa. It\u2019s sensational. And no, I don\u2019t really eat it in a corner alone; I share. And people go crazy for it.The salsa in question is a roasted tomato and cashew salsa from our carnitas party menu, and it\u2019s packed with brilliance. It comes out a beautiful deep mahogany color from using REAL dried chiles. The little pieces of roasted cashew offset the heat and give it amazing texture. The tomatoes get roasted, which brings out the tomatoes\u2019 true flavors, usually hidden in all of its watery seedy guts. This salsa is about concentrated flavor. It\u2019s so far from the jarred stuff, which taste like mushy cold tomatoes and raw onion in comparison. So. Far.At first, this all sounds kinda high maintenance. Roasted? Who has the time? But you do, trust me. I\u2019ve probably made this 10 times in the past year.I've made the carnitas that go with this salsa, too\u2014they're PERFECT IN EVERY WAY.\nLinda XiaoFirst things first: Get over any qualms you have about dried chiles. If you've got a stash of pasilla chiles in your pantry, you can ignore this, but for the rest of you, these should be a staple in your kitchen like canned beans and weed-in-an-old-tea-tin are. Dried chiles last nearly forever, and also you will be making a lot of salsa from now on. You can find them in nearly every grocery store, and online, too.Guajillo chiles\u2014great for this salsa.\nTom SchierlitzFor this recipe, brought to us by the wonderful Rick Martinez, you\u2019ll need 6 dried cascabel chiles or 3 pasilla chiles (seeds removed, chillll), plus 2 morita chiles. Pasilla, these huge honkers, are easier to find for me, so I just go with those, but I\u2019ve also used guajillo or ancho depending on what my pantry stash is like. Morita are small, squat, wrinkly little fellas, and can be tough to find, but I\u2019ve used dried chipotle\u2014per the Food Substitution Bible, they\u2019re both smoky\u2014in a pinch. TBH it\u2019s hard to mess this up. I\u2019m probably making this sound like a super spicy salsa, but it\u2019s not a face melter\u2014more of a subtle heat that keeps you coming back, not the kind that makes you sweat and do the rosary.All you do is throw the chiles on a cookie sheet and roast them for 5 minutes at 350\u00b0. It wakes them up and activates all the flavor oils or whatever. You throw some cashews on another cookie sheet and roast those until toasty golden, like 10 minutes. (DON\u2019T LET THEM BURN. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, DON\u2019T LET THEM BURN.)After the nuts and chiles are out of the oven, it\u2019s the tomatoes\u2019 turn. Ramp up the oven to 450\u00b0 and put 4 large, cored tomatoes on a rimmed baking sheet/casserole thing for 35-ish minutes, until their skin is browned. (Sometimes I do this step before the chiles and cashews so that they can cool a little before blend time.)BLEND TIME.First you blend only the tomatoes with garlic, lime, and salt. Then you add the chiles, stems removed, and blend a lil more. And finally, toss in the cashews\u2014but only for like 5 pulses. You want tiny cashew bites in the salsa, not a smooth pur\u00e9e of flavor-blasted baby food. Taste, add some salt, and taste again. Then refrigerate it until party time. And get ready to be asked to make it again. And again. And again.Get the recipe:Roasted Tomato\u2013Cashew SalsaView RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titSalsaCashewSuper BowlPartyTomatoDipNever FailRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
