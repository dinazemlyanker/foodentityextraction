As you won\u2019t be individually stirring these 'tinis, water is added to aid in the dilution you\u2019d normally get from ice. That\u2019s necessary to transform the mixture from pure alcohol to a tasty, drinkable beverage. This is the cocktail hour course from Alison Roman\u2019s \u201cSteak House Night in America\u201d menu: Low-and-Slow Rib Roast, Baked Potatoes Deluxe, The Greatest Creamed Greens, and Upside-Down Apricot Tart.Recipe adapted with permission from Nothing Fancy: Unfussy Food for Having People Over by Alison Roman (Clarkson Potter, an imprint of Penguin Random House, LLC).

Stir until well combined (alcohol and water have different densities, so you need this step for proper mixing). Chill until ready to serve.Step 2Pour over a glass of ice (it doesn\u2019t need to be a martini glass) and let guests garnish however they like. Olive brine and olives for dirty, cocktail onions for a Gibson vibe, and a lemon twist for, uh, a twist.How would you rate Martini Bar?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (1)Back to TopTriangleThis is not a review, although I cannot wait to make this!
