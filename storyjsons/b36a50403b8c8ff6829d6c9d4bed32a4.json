That\u2019s exactly the kind of battle a manufactured \u201ccake tester\u201d is up against. I constantly reach for it for tasks around the kitchen (prodding a boiling potato, poking a steamed squash, unraveling a tight knot, sure), but I never use it for its eponymous job. The somewhat-harsh reality is that cake testers, while handy in so many ways, simply aren\u2019t great (or even good) at testing cakes. But you know what little tool does excel at assessing the doneness of a cake? A toothpick.So whenever I'm at the point of the recipe where I have to insert a cake tester, I follow in the footsteps of Chris Morocco, the great baker Alice Medrich, and my mom, all of whom swear by the toothpick. Its rough, uneven surface means that crumbs will adhere, and its light color makes it easier to judge the moisture level of the cake. If you don\u2019t have a toothpick, a thin bamboo skewer can stand in its place.You should own a cake tester, but you shouldn't use it for testing cake.\nPhoto by Chelsie CraigOfficially-sanctioned cake testers, on the other hand, are made of stainless steel and therefore too slippery to show the full range of what\u2019s happening inside the pan. Sure a metal cake tester might come out coated in a sheen of batter (your cake is not done), but it can\u2019t communicate the breadth of possibilities. Crumbs don\u2019t cling; slight moistness isn\u2019t visible because the tester won\u2019t change color when it\u2019s damp. A cake tester gives you one of two answers even though you\u2019re probably searching for a more nuanced response.No matter what tester you\u2019re using, it\u2019s just as important to follow all of the recipe\u2019s cues for doneness. In Sohla El-Waylly\u2019s Cardamom-Pistachio Carrot Cake, for example, a cake tester would likely come out clean before the cake is fully cooked. A toothpick would give you a more accurate reading, but for this cake (and for many!), it\u2019s important to touch it with your finger. If it feels foamy and airy and your fingerprint sinks in and leaves an indentation, give it another five minutes. Your fingerprint should spring back and you should be able to feel the density of the cake.So while I\u2019ll hang onto my cake tester\u2014one day I might even use it to judge the doneness of a fish fillet\u2014I might call it by a different name, like prodder or poker or piercer? I\u2019ll stick to my toothpicks and, since I never use them to pick my teeth, I\u2019ll call them \u201ccake testers\u201d instead. Got it?Get the recipe:Cardamom-Pistachio Carrot CakeHere\u2019s what happened after carrot cake met carrot halwa, the milky, long-cooking, spoonably-soft confection common in South Asia. Raisins, cinnamon, and cream cheese frosting made way for brown-butter pistachios, cardamom, and sticky carrot glaze and the rest of their romance was history.\u00a0View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titBasically BakingRecipes you want to make.
