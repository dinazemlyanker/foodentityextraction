The dark leafy green is silky like spinach but has chew like a gentler kale as well as edible ribs and stems with celery-like crunch. Among the ribbons of Swiss chard, you\u2019ll find briny, salty pops of mustard-macerated onions, aged or sharp cheddar, and crushed pretzels. Not intended to be confused with Wurstsalat, the southern German salad that features sausage, this recipe is instead an ode to the flavors often found at beer gardens\u2014okay, minus the beer. Use large hard sourdough pretzels or nuggets, which have a good amount of dry interior, ideal for soaking up dressing.Ingredients4 servings4Tbsp.

Spatzle Judith STANFlorida1/9/2022This was unbelievably sour and gross. Anonymous10/22/2021Im sure this salad tastes great but it is the direct antithesis of beer garden culture. ill give it a try but make some adjustments:\n- real (soft, yeasty) pretzels\n- butter instead of olive oil\n- lamb's lettuce instead of swiss chard (much too french and lamb's lettuce has more crunch)\n- Th\u00fcringer Rostbratwurst because it's simply the best bratwurst. \n\nIll let you know hot it went :)\nJudith from Swabia \nSp\u00e4tzleJudithSwabia, Germany4/8/2021This salad is fabulous! I subbed in Field Roast Italian Garlic & Fennel (plant -based) sausage to make it vegetarian. Delicious!
