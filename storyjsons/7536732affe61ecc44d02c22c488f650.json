Netflix is no nurse, and the delivery guy definitely won\u2019t tuck you into bed after dropping off your matzah ball soup. Oh, adulthood. Tired of Googling our symptoms, we decided to ask the people who know how to get healthy best: our grandparents.Armed with the particular kind of wisdom distilled from surviving countless flu seasons and raising multiple generations of sick kids, they rose to the occasion. Here, our grandparents (and other people\u2019s grandparents), share their time-honored home remedies and advice for how to get healthy whether you've got the sniffles or the stomach flu. Go ahead, close that WebMD tab. Grandma\u2019s here.\u201cIf you feel a cold coming on, gargle with salt water and steam your face over a pot of boiling water with a few drips of eucalyptus. Eat yogurt when traveling to keep tummy troubles at bay\u2014yogurt and rice is good for stomachaches.\u201d \u2014Tourie Nozari, mother of e-commerce editor Elaheh Nozari and grandmother.\u201cMy parents used to do an old Russian treatment for a cold called a gogol mogol. You can Google it! You make a broth with a raw egg and some honey and whiskey, and it helps a sore throat. You have to sip it while it\u2019s hot. \u201d\u2014Jean Abarbanel, grandmother of Healthyish editorial assistant Aliza Abarbanel.\u201cMy mother would rub you down with vapor rub if you were all stuffy, because it helps you to breathe. She'd make you lie there and rub it on your neck and chest, then put a warm towel on you. I was waiting for her to make me swallow that crap! I was planning on cutting it out, but I actually used it in my adulthood. I think it helped, might have killed me, but it killed something else, too.\u201d\u2014Nana Henrietta Hartshorn, grandmother of assistant to the editor in chief Ryan Walker.\u201cMy big thing was dissolving any medication in chocolate ice cream. Who cares if you're not supposed to eat dairy when you're sick? Also I think everyone who is Jewish says this, but make chicken soup. Period.\u201d\u2014Grandma Marilyn Hoder Salmon, grandmother of web editorial assistant Emma Wartzman.\u201cFor vomiting and diarrhea you should not eat food or raw vegetables till you feel better.  Only Gatorade and salt crackers, and Jell-O, \u2018till you are over the bout.  If you are not better in 24-36 hours go to the doctor quickly because you will dehydrate. And do not wash your hair and go out in the cold or at night right after washing your hair.  I have experience\u2014remember I grew up in New York City! I guess you can Google all this.  But this is just grandmotherly knowledge.\u201d\u2014Abuela Vivian Jaime, grandmother of senior visuals editor Elizabeth Jaime.\"Don\u2019t go out too much. Don\u2019t get over-tired. When you\u2019re tired that is when you get sick easier. Stay home and rest and drink juice. Rest is very important. Chicken noodle soup is good, matzo ball soup, eggs, things that are light. Gargle with salt water if your throat is sore, and chicken soup will also help for that because it has a lot of salt.\" \u2014Grammy Ina Bellis, grandmother of associate web editor Alyse Whitney.\"When one [of my six kids] got sick, it went from one to the other. I called it City Hospital. We used a bucket to catch whatever such things needing catching. Campbell's bean with bacon soup is one of my favorite remedies. In fact, I just had some the other night. It's good, but also nutritious and filling.\u201d \u2014 Grandma Rose Harris, grandmother of senior web editor Alex Beggs.\"'Plow through it' is the family recipe. Been seeing this for generations. One may call it denial; its been a traditional family coping tool for as long as I can remember. Matzo ball soup is the food/medicine that cures all, especially when served on bed tray in bed.\nBoxes of Manischewitz are always on hand in our house, ready to be pulled out for pneumonia, mono, flu, sniffles, stomach aches, bruises or bad moods. Whether it cures or not, it clearly brings comfort to the patient and the nurturers.\" \u2014Jill Weinberg, mother of senior editor Julia Kramer and grandmother of Philip Kramer.\u201cGo see a doctor.\u201d\u2014Jay Abarbanel, grandfather to Healthyish editorial assistant Aliza Abarbanel.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishGet WellRead MoreLifestyleThe Healthyish Guide to Feeling Better AlreadyGallery13 SlidesBy The Healthyish TeamRecipes you want to make.
