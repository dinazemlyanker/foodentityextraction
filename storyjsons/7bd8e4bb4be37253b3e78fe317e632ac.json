I added three cloves of garlic confit, a teaspoon of fish sauce, and salt to taste.  It\u2019s next level.  #cookingwithtff Everyone raves about it.  I put it on everything!  I even put scallion sauce on my scallion sauce.  billy_thomNorwalk, CT6/22/2019The brightness of the rice vinegar & parsley balances perfectly with the nutty intensity of the sesame oil. I want to put this on everything!AnonymousBrooklyn, NY2/26/2019I made this with the big batch chicken thighs for a dinner party and everyone loved the sauce, myself included.  the rice vinegar added just the right amount of acidity. I used the whole serrano and the sauce still wasn't spicy, just had a nice serrano flavor.  I also thinned the sauce using a little extra grapeseed oil instead of water.AnonymousSanta Cruz, CA2/25/2019The flavors were all wrong for my taste. :( The consistency of the sauce didn\u2019t turn out like I thought it would, but I blame that on my poor blender and using crystallized honey.Anonymous2/20/2019Explore Bon App\u00e9titCondimentSalad DressingSaladSauceMarinadeScallionOnionVegetableParsleyHerbs & SpicesQuickDairy-FreeGluten-FreeVeganVegetarianHealthyishRecipes you want to make.
