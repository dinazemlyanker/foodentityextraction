However, it doesn\u2019t keep well (the lime becomes too prominent in the sauce the day after). Serves as the perfect accompaniment to the mojo meatballs. Hanwashington, dc12/16/2020Loved this recipe ! made a little bit more of the dressing and used it as a condiment for eggs.. was delicious as well :) thank you BAcatfabiMontr\u00e9al,Canada5/8/2020SO delicious! This salad packs well for work lunches all week. The dressing is so good, I honestly could use it as a chip dip (or to drizzle on tacos or nachos??). It took a few stops for me to hunt down watermelon radishes, but I'm so glad I did. Thanks BA!AnonymousGrand Rapids, Michigan1/24/2020Wow wow wow \ud83d\ude31\ud83e\udd24 this recipe is absolutely delicious! Thank you BA. Enjoyed every bite of the salad. YES I will make this again, saving this recipe and YES I definitely recommend it. The only adjustment i made is, I only used 1/4 Cup of lime juice not a 1/2 cup. Also didn\u2019t have mint on hand so I used cilantro. But will try it with the mint next time. jessicaolBrooklyn, NY1/11/2020Explore Bon App\u00e9titSlawSaladScallionOnionVegetableNapa CabbageCabbageLeafy GreensLimeCitrusFruitQuickEasySideDairy-FreeGluten-FreeNut-FreeVeganVegetarianKetoHealthyishDinnerRecipes you want to make.
