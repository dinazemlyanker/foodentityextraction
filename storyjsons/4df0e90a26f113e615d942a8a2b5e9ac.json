Like a rib eye, pork shoulder has lots of intramuscular fat, and like strip steak, it has satisfying chew. This recipe shows how slicing it thickly and grilling it swiftly maximizes the enjoyment of both.Ingredients4 servingsPork2Tbsp. fennel seeds1Tbsp. yellow mustard seeds1\u00bdtsp. black peppercorns1tsp. crushed red pepper flakes1tsp. ground cinnamon4\u00be\"-thick boneless pork shoulder (Boston butt) steaks (about 2 lb.) or pork blade chopsKosher saltGreens and AssemblyVegetable oil (for grill)1lemon, halved2Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling2garlic cloves2bunches mustard greens, leaves torn into large piecesKosher salt, freshly ground pepper\u00bdtsp. crushed red pepper flakesFlaky sea saltSpecial EquipmentA spice mill or a mortar and pestlePreparationPorkStep 1Toast fennel and mustard seeds in a small saucepan over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until fragrant and mustard seeds are just beginning to pop, about 4 minutes.

St Louis has been grilling pork steaks for at least 50 years. Oh, I\u2019m sorry, we\u2019re low brow flyover space; why would you know what we\u2019re doing?Amy B.St. Louis, MO11/22/2020This recipe will be saved to the tried-and-true log. What an easy, elegant, and delicious dish! Even my anti-greens dad, husband and son enjoyed this one.  The pork was to die for, though I used loin instead of shoulder. I substituted flat leaf kale for the mustard greens and it was delicious. I served it with a side of quinoa salad. This a fantastic summer grilling meal. All my dinner guests raved about how delicious it was.EmilyB91180Miami, FL7/29/2018Yes. Pork shoulder is great but stop telling everybody, will you? Oh, and by the way, dry rub is the way to go if you want that spicy brown crusty exterior.fnielson925867/26/2018Pork shoulder is, by leaps and bounds, the best cut of pork. Grab a few pounds and slice the steaks yourself, and hit them with any number of SE Asian marinades, and you're set. Big ups BA, keep the fatty chard bits coming!AnonymousSan Francisco7/10/2018Explore Bon App\u00e9titPork ShoulderPorkMeatMustard GreensLeafy GreensVegetableEasyWeeknight MealsMainDairy-FreeGluten-FreeKetoGrillingDinnerRecipes you want to make.
