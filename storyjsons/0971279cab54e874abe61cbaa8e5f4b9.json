In It\u2019s That Simple, we\u2019ll talk you through the dishes and drinks we make with our eyes closed. Today, lavender ranch.Buttermilk ranch is the most perfect dressing ever created, and I cannot be convinced otherwise. Green goddess is great, but I\u2019m not drizzling my pizza with it; honey mustard slaps, but I\u2019m not slathering it on my kale salad; and I love raspberry vinaigrette, but there\u2019s just no way I\u2019m using it for dipping chicken tenders. The fact of the matter is, ranch reigns supreme.What if some madman took it upon himself to try to improve upon perfection? Would they be flying too close to the sun? If so, call me Icarus because I have unlocked the secret to making the most mind-blowing ranch dressing at home: culinary lavender. You might be thinking, \u201cFlowers in my precious ranch? Chala, you are a madman!\u201d But hear me out: The brightness of lavender is an amazing complement to fatty ingredients like buttermilk, and its subtle piney-ness pairs well with the other herbs traditionally found in ranch.Ultra-Blue Premium Lavender Flower Buds$9 at The Spice HouseThink of it as a delicious cultural exchange between the south of France and the southern United States\u2014herbes de Provence meets buttermilk dressing. The result is a rich, tangy, delicately floral ranch sure to impress even the most ornery of ranch purists. Don\u2019t just take my (incredibly biased) word for it\u2014make lavender buttermilk ranch yourself!Here\u2019s how: In a small bowl, whisk together \u00bd cup Greek yogurt (or sour cream), \u00bd cup mayonnaise (preferably Kewpie), \u00bd cup buttermilk, and 1 tsp. lemon juice. Then chop 1 tsp. fresh dill and \u00bc teaspoon dried culinary lavender (chopping your lavender is crucial as the flavor of whole buds can be overwhelming) and add to the yogurt mixture. Now for the other herbs and spices: Add \u00bc tsp. dried rosemary, \u00bc tsp. dried oregano, \u00bc tsp. freshly ground black pepper, \u00bc tsp. garlic powder, and \u00bc tsp. onion powder to the mixture. Whisk everything well, and let it chill in the refrigerator for at least 15 minutes for the flavors to meld. Garnish with more fresh herbs, like thinly sliced chives or additional dill, if you\u2019d like.Photograph by Isa Zapata, Food Styling by Cyd McDowellNow you\u2019re ready to use it anywhere you would use the bottled stuff.
