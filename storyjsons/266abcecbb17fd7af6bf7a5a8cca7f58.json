Every supporting ingredient in this recipe exists to make beets taste like their best selves: The maple syrup accentuates their sweetness, the hazelnuts play up their earthiness (but it\u2019s not too earthy, we promise), and the lemon juice brightens up the whole thing.IngredientsMakes about 3 cups1lb. red beets without greens, scrubbed1\u00bdtsp. kosher salt, plus more1cup blanched hazelnuts3garlic cloves\u00bdcup coarsely chopped parsley\u00bdcup (or more) extra-virgin olive oil2Tbsp.
