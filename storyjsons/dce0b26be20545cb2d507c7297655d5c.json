Chef\u2013StyleThe food from Kismet Chefs Sarah Hymanson and Sara Kramer is West Coast wonderful, and their beach-day menu is no exception. Best of all, this elevated-but-easy spread can be re-created anywhere. Here\u2019s the trick to a next-level surfside menu that\u2019ll draw hungry stares from two blankets over.By S.Pellegrino\u00aeJune 13, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailHarry EelmanFacebookTwitterEmailThe vibe is chilled-out and distinctly West Coast at Kismet, the airy restaurant in Los Angeles known for its produce-forward, Middle-East-by-way-of-California cuisine. Chefs Sarah Hymanson and Sara Kramer, who opened the spot in early 2017, are its masterminds, and together they make running the show look easy. Keeping in motion the many moving parts of an all-day caf\u00e9 is no easy feat: There\u2019s caffeinated breakfast, which spills into casual lunch over S.Pellegrino sparkling water, which pours into moodily lit dinner, which morphs into late-night cocktails. Everything is set to repeat the next morning, which makes elusive off-time all the more precious.On those days, Hymanson and Kramer travel from Kismet\u2019s digs on Hollywood Boulevard to the white sands of Zuma Beach in sun-drenched Malibu. But you can hardly expect chefs to stop being chefs when they\u2019re not working: Their enhanced beach-day spread is a meditation on good living, both approachable and easy-to-replicate, but\u2014much like the food at Kismet\u2014bright, eye-popping, and deeply satisfying.Harry EelmanWhat are their secrets? Bon App\u00e9tit tracked down Hymanson and Kramer to find out.1. Power Up the Produce. In the Venn diagram of Middle Eastern and California cuisines, the overlapping bit is, without a doubt, fresh and massively flavorful produce. Convenient, considering there\u2019s plenty of it on the West Coast. \u201cA picnic is such a simple thing, and it\u2019s just elevating it a bit by bringing some delicious produce from the market,\u201d said Hymanson. Classic picnic foods\u2014like, say, rich herbed labneh and crisp crudit\u00e9s\u2014are all the more enticing with gorgeous blush-hued breakfast radishes or wine-colored baby carrots.Harry Eelman2. Elevate the Drink Situation. The fastest way to keep the beach mood light and bubbly is with literal bubbles. S.Pellegrino\u00ae Sparkling Natural Mineral Water has a way of making any meal feel instantly elevated and put together\u2014plus, nothing beats the sight of its signature green bottle glinting in the sun. (S.Pellegrino\u00ae plus sand plus beach spread equals Instagram gold.)Harry Eelman3. Make It Travel. Unless your kitchen backs onto the beach (in which case, good for you!),  anything you prepare will have to brave the trip from refrigerator to beach blanket. You want \u201cthings that are good when they\u2019re hot and when they\u2019re cold,\u201d said Hymanson, a.k.a. dishes that don\u2019t spoil easily. Marinated salads\u2014such as Kismet\u2019s briny marinated feta with roasted onion, beets, and floral orange blossom\u2014are your new best friend. Plus, preserved goodies like harissa-marinated olives and super-sweet dates dried at the peak of their ripeness.4. Snack It Up. At the beach, the less cutlery required, the better. That means finger food is the go-to move. Cue Kismet\u2019s delicate, lemon-spiked chicken and pine nut hand pies. \u201cThey\u2019re really easy to just grab and pass around,\u201d Hymanson said. \u201cThey\u2019re crunchy on the outside and rich and savory and tangy on the inside,\u201d Kramer chimed in, adding that \u201cthey\u2019re great dipped in tahini, which we also brought.\u201d You didn\u2019t think they\u2019d skimp on the tahini, did you?Harry Eelman5. Get Salad-y. \u201cWe generally bring a lot of salads,\u201d said Hymanson. That\u2019s putting it mildly: Hymanson and Kramer have mastered the art of flavor-bombed, veg-forward dishes that elbow meat entr\u00e9es out of the spotlight. Consider their ribboned cucumbers basking in citrus and creamy labneh shot through with rosewater. Or their bright orange, Moroccan-inflected carrots flecked with crunchy walnuts and fresh dill. Sure, they might be a little more work than your average three-ingredient salad, but the payoff is huge. \u201cFor the beach, you can make a few things a little bit differently than you usually do,\u201d Hymanson stressed. \u201cIt\u2019s fun to be a little bit creative with it.\u201dHarry Eelman6. Think: More Is More. When planning a beach gathering, \u201cwe really like to over-prepare,\u201d Kramer admitted. And yeah, sometimes that means bringing more food than your guests could possibly eat. Don\u2019t sweat it, Kramer says: The aesthetic of abundance is always a hit, and there\u2019s no shame in packing up the leftovers for tomorrow\u2019s lunch. Plus, a sprawling spread means more friends can pop over on a moment\u2019s notice\u2014without anyone going hungry. That scenario plays out all too often for Hymanson and Kramer, who\u2019ve crafted an artistic and supportive circle of L.A. friends who seem to crawl out of the woodwork on chef-catered beach days.Harry EelmanAll in all, the Kismet team\u2019s surfside ethos can be boiled down to a single piece of advice, which Hymanson put succinctly: \u201cAlways have more food than you need!\u201dWant to learn more stylish and satisfying ways to elevate hangouts with friends?
