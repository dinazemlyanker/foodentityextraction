It\u2019s the perfect soup for a cold day.  Love the user feedback. I made the rice separately and let everyone  add in as desired. it\u2019s already on repeat. AnonymousNew York 2/13/2022Delicious.Michael PasterRed Bank, NJ2/1/2022Just came off the stove here and it's fabulous. Read through the reviews about the amount of rice that should be use and decided on half a cup. Really because that is exactly what I had on hand. Turned out so nice. Smells so good while it's cooking. This is a keeper. M.C. Jersey Shore 1/28/2022This was easy to make, delicious, made the house smell great and was a nice meal on a cold evening. I read the comments about too much rice but decided to use the full 2 cups, and my family was fine with it being less brothy. However, my son recommended that I make it next time without the rice, because both my kids had tasted - and loved - the broth. In any case, everyone finished their whole bowl, and we have plenty of leftovers for a meal to come.Lnr OlsenLos Angeles, CA1/25/2022This was delicious. I followed the advice of the reviewers and reduced the quantity of rice (2/3 cup, based on 1:3 ratio uncooked to cooked rice, don't know if that was the \"right\" amount, but it worked).\n\nI noticed many folks used chicken stock; I used water as per the recipe. The relatively long simmer, along with the herbs, did yield a flavorful broth. Stock would no doubt elevate it, if you want to go that route. The Basmati rice held up well when we reheated the leftovers. \n\nThis is definitely a keeper.SoozPinch, WV1/23/2022This recipe is fabulous tasting..but definitely wish I would have read reviews...making it now, using a little over half cup of rice....when I used the 2 cups, I had to add almost a whole container of chicken broth...this is actually one of our favorite new recipes..KBSt. Pete, FL1/22/2022So delicious! All cooks make revisions according to their taste, and I made a few. I used bone in thighs for added flavor, and chicken stock instead of water. Also added a half cup of dry white wine along with the quart of stock, and reduced the rice to one cup. Texture and liquid to solid ratio was perfect. Will definitely make again!Mary Ellen MayMiddletown, PA1/22/2022Saw this recipe and immediately thought  it a new addition to our Soup Sunday. I do always read the reviews and my thoughts were the same on the rice to liquid ratio. What really stuck out though is the author speaks of his memories with his Nana and discussing her homemade chicken broth she always had in the deep freeze. Yet this recipe adds water twice? I will be making this but will also alter the rice as well as adding my homemade broth or at least store bought when I do not have any.AnonymousCalifornia 1/20/2022Well, as of now my kitchen smells like a four-star restaurant. It is a stew. If you don't like a lot of rice, cut it back. If you do, it's perfect. If you want to add more water or broth, super. I have tasted it and I love it. I personally would not change a thing. Shelby Kentucky1/19/2022To be clear - this is still edible as is. It will not look like the picture, unless you cook that rice separately and add it in later. Skimmed the reviews, did not understand the extent of the issue with this recipe's ratios. Doubled the recipe because I had two pounds of thighs to go through, but I didn't realize how much liquid 4 cups of basmati rice would absorb, as in literally all of it. Kind of a slog to eat through, to be honest. At this point it's basically just stuffing but with rice instead of bread. Very tasty though, I will be making this again. Just with half the rice and more stock to actually have soup. Or just precook rice with some of the seasonings and broth in my rice cooker.  And using two pounds of chicken in the base recipe is better than one. For any part of the recipe that has you adding water, use stock or Better than Bouillon to give it some flavor, plain water is boring for soup. A combo of Roasted Chicken, Onion, and Vegetable BTB bases would knock water alone out of the park. Can't wait to try this one over.DSIndiana1/19/2022Hindsight is 20/20, should have read the reviews and used much less rice and double the amount of meat. Also, add some Watkins  Boullion when adding the rice and water.  I will try the recipe again with revisions.PatifyBuffalo, NY1/19/2022Moral of this story: always read the reviews first! I plan to make this, but based on all the reviews, will only use 1/2 cup rice.AnonymousCanada1/19/2022Please Bon Apetit. Please revise this recipe to lower the cups of rice to either 1/2 cup uncooked basamati or 1 cup cooked so that it can truly be a stew and not just really flavored rice. Mari G Miami 1/19/2022I trust Bon Apetit recipes, and I questioned the two cups of rice in the ingredients.  I now have a mountain of rice, very flavorful rice.  I agree that I would add just 1 cup of rice, or even just a 1/2 cup rice so that the flavor of the broth and tender chicken can be enjoyed.  I also had home made chicken broth and substituted that for the water. I would like to try this recipe again with the stated adjustments.Debbie MatticeBuffalo New York1/17/2022This was delicious.  I read all the reviews the other day, and tried it with one cup of rice.. It was not stew, but a nice and tasty, homey, one-pot chicken and rice dish, if maybe a bit too much rice.    For stew, I guess I would go down to 1/2 cup and see what happens!
