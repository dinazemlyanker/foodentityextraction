Got Plant Questions? Ask the Plant KweenSince the beginning of quarantine, Christopher Griffin, a.k.a. @plantkween, has acted as my digital wellness tonic.

But facing down a long, cold winter lockdown, I realized what I needed even more was an IRL space as green as Griffin\u2019s. So, desperate for advice, I caught up with the Kween themself for answers to all my most burning botanical questions.

Plus, it gives me reason to shower every day. Here\u2019s how I did it. \u2013Alex Beggs, staff writerPhotograph by Laura Murray3. Live in TechnicolorIf months of staring at the same walls didn\u2019t weaken minimalism\u2019s appeal, one look at designer Ellen Van Dusen\u2019s gloriously over-the-top Brooklyn brownstone did. \u201cNot everyone has the same relationship with color, but little objects can really shift the mood of a room,\u201d Van Dusen says. \u201cIt\u2019s an easy way to change things up.\u201d Seeing how she combines patterns, colors, and tchotchkes will fuel your own decoration dreams. \u2013Aliza Abarbanel, assistant editorIllustration by Marisol Muro4.

Stop and Smell the Rose CandlesIncense isn\u2019t just essential for clearing the air of last night\u2019s salmon. \u201cEspecially if we\u2019re not leaving home much, you can create different emotional and psychological environments by using scent,\u201d says neuroscientist Rachel Herz, Ph.D, author of Scent of Desire and researcher on the psychological science of smell. Smell and emotional memory have a fundamental neurological link, making it possible (but not guaranteed) to change your mood with a whiff of freshly baked cookies. But there\u2019s a catch: Our brains quickly acclimate to scents\u201415 minutes, max\u2014so a single candle will only go so far.
