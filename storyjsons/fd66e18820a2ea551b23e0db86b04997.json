Here's how to do it.By Alex DelanyJanuary 23, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Ted CavanaughFacebookTwitterEmailWe\u2019ll get right to the point. Yes. Toasting nuts at home is worth it. In fact, it\u2019s more than worth it, and if you don\u2019t know how to toast nuts, we\u2019ll teach you. Because toasting nuts at home will straight-up change your salad game, snack game, pilaf game, and just about any other kitchen-related game you might participate in forever.Toasted nuts that you buy at the store are fine\u2014we've been known to call for them from time to time. But why settle for \u201cfine\u201d when you can do better in less than 10 minutes? Store bought nuts are never really toasted enough. They\u2019re about 75% of the way there, but when you buy raw nuts and toast them at home, you can take it all the way, bringing out deep, nutty, roasted flavors you can\u2019t get from the store-bought stuff. You just can't.Most of the time, we like to toast nuts in the oven. Why? Because the dry, indirect heat the oven offers will toast the nuts more evenly than a skillet will. Using a skillet might trim a few minutes off your cook time, but the heat is uneven. Even if you\u2019re using medium or medium-low heat, you\u2019ll still get black or charred spots. Using a sheet pan in the oven will give you beautiful, even browning. Here's how to do it.First things first: Toss the nuts with a good pinch of kosher salt. As the nuts heat up, oils will rise to the surface, giving the salt something to adhere to\u2014a good thing. Spread them out in an even layer on a sheet pan, and pop them in a 350\u00b0 oven. Generally speaking, lighter, more tender nuts like pecans, pistachios, and walnuts will take 6-8 minutes to get to a good place. Denser nuts like almonds, hazelnuts, and macadamias will take more like 8-10 minutes to finish toasting. But trust your nose over the timer: Good toasted nuts should be fragrant and roast-y smelling, never burnt or acrid. Regardless of the type of nut, you should give your sheet pan a solid shake halfway through to shift the position of the nuts for even browning.Deeply toasted nuts take any rice pilaf over the edge.\nAlex LauYou should also make sure to transfer the nuts to a plate or bowl right after you take them out of the oven. They\u2019ll continue toasting if you leave them on the pan, and if you have them right where you want them, that\u2019s a huge bummer. From here, you can just store the nuts at room temperature. They\u2019ll be their best on the day you roast them, but they\u2019re also good for the next three days. After that, they start to lose that toasty aroma and flavor. And we\u2019re here for the toasty-ness. The roasty-ness. The nuttiness. At least one of those was a real word. But that\u2019s not important. What is important is that you get a big batch of toasted nuts going. STAT!Toast up some walnuts, and make it rain all over this pesto potato salad:Pesto Potato SaladTo test boiled potatoes for doneness, use a skewer or the tines of a fork rather than the tip of a knife so you know they\u2019re truly tender (a knife slides through the flesh way too easily). To test boiled eggs for doneness\u2014wait, you can\u2019t! Just make sure the eggs are room temperature when you drop them in the water (otherwise they\u2019re prone to cracking), set a timer right away, and have an ice bath at the ready.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titBasicallyNutAlmondWalnutPecanRecipes you want to make.
