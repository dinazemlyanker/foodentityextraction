Catch up on all the recipes, articles, and more here.We live for gingerbread, hot toddies, and all the other festive foods and drinks this time of year brings, but we also crave a bit of balance\u2014especially around dinnertime. That's why we're taking our cooking queues from chef and wellness advocate Sophia Roe. When Roe cooks dinner at home, it\u2019s always streamlined for speed. Based in Brooklyn, Roe has been busy producing and hosting Counter Space, a new Vice show. Each episode explores the global evolution of food through the context of current events, like Hong Kong's protest food and Yemen's crisis-plagued coffee fields. When she\u2019s not doing that, she\u2019s teaching her devoted Instagram followers how to preserve lemons and braise cabbage while also engaging them in candid conversations about subjects such as anti-racism and how to cope with trauma.\u00a0So when Roe needs to get dinner on the table for herself and her family, she prizes healthyish plant-based dishes with minimal prep or fuss. \u201cSome people think elevated food needs to take a long time, but that\u2019s not true,\u201d she says. \u201cYou just need to put purpose and thought into it.\u201d Instead of relying on too many ingredients or high-tech equipment, Roe deploys practical techniques (preheat your baking sheet for the crispiest roasted sweet potatoes!) to create meals with instant appeal. Her recipes below are all designed to come together quickly from start to finish but will go even faster if you prep a few things, like a pot of black lentils or brown rice, ahead of time. Cooking dinner has never felt better.All-Dressed-Up Cauliflower RiceFluffy, textured cauliflower rice with warm spices and crunchy roasted pumpkin seeds.View RecipeBeluga Lentil and Root Vegetable SlawAny crunchy vegetable or fruit can live in this colorful slaw\u2014try fennel, small turnips, or Asian pear.View RecipeSweet Potatoes With Maple TahiniCrispy roasted sweet potato wedges get tossed in a sweet and nutty tahini dressing in this quick vegetarian weeknight dinner.View RecipeTofu With Rice and Miso-Maple DressingCrispy tofu cubes get tossed in a sweet and savory glaze that hits all the umami notes.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titHoliday 2020HealthyishWeeknightVegetarianRead Morerecipes63 Healthy Weeknight Meals That Are Faster Than Waiting for DeliveryGallery63 SlidesBy The Healthyish TeamRecipes you want to make.
