We asked 80 of the most interesting people we know to reveal the local spots they love the most.When I lived in South Florida in my early twenties, I would sometimes suffer the four-hour drive to the theme park capital of the world\u2014Orlando\u2014to visit friends. At the time, I was convinced the only things they ate in that town came from diners or whatever they served in the Magic Kingdom. Denny\u2019s was the only non-Disney restaurant to sit, talk, and eat. I was sure of it.That is, until I discovered the Ravenous Pig in nearby Winter Park, 15 years after I moved away.  It felt like the one place within a nearly 20-mile radius where you couldn\u2019t find a pair of Mickey Mouse ears and didn\u2019t see the Disney logo everywhere. In a city where the lunch and dinner options feel limited to the Biergarten at Epcot, Publix subs, and yes, Denny\u2019s, the bustling James Beard\u2013nominated restaurant and brewery is there for the year-rounders. All preconceived tourist trap or \u201cFlorida man\u201d notions you might have of Orlando, and Florida in general, go out the window once you enter the restaurant.I first happened upon the place when I needed somewhere to regroup by myself with a stiff drink and a bite to eat. Not long after I sat down at the bar, I was served up a formidable Black Angus short rib and brisket burger topped with a smattering of crisp lettuce, tangy blue cheese, and caramelized onions. The whole thing was laid out on a slab of pinewood accompanied by a small cast-iron skillet filled with crispy fries. I drank two gin and tonics on tap. At some point, before switching to wine, I made friends with the bartender, then the people next to me. Everybody at that bar, it seemed, wanted to talk.Opened in 2007 by husband-and-wife duo and Orlando-area natives Julie and James Petrakis, the Ravenous Pig is full of locals ranging from university professors to Orlando Magic players. You could sit in the handsome dining area with the white linen tablecloths, but the long bar is the place to be. While the food is definitely the best I\u2019ve had in the area, the variety of clientele is why I keep returning.During that first visit, a pair of 80-somethings struck up a conversation with me. The husband spoke with a mid-Atlantic accent, like a Roosevelt or George Plimpton, but claimed his family settled in central Florida at some point during the early 20th century, lured by all the warm air and sunshine promises of a better life. He could remember before Walt Disney set up shop and when Jack Kerouac had lived in the nearby neighborhood of College Park toward the end of his life. The wife rattled off a number of fascinating locations all over the globe where they could have moved, but they chose to stay in Orlando to raise their kids and retire there. Yet after all that, the man looked around the bar and said, \u201cI\u2019m glad a place like this opened up,\u201d with a wide smile.Jason Diamond is the deputy editor of Punch.ContentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Explore Bon App\u00e9titNeighborhood RestaurantsRecipes you want to make.
