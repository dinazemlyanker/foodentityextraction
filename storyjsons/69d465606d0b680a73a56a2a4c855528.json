As kids they didn\u2019t just dabble in lemonade stands; they ran a full-on sidewalk bakery selling homemade cupcakes and cookies. They started tie-dying at age three, learned how to knit and weave from their grandmother as teenagers, and both went on to study art in college: Temidra with a focus in fashion and textiles and Tanya in fine art and photography. \u201cOut of college we both went into our respective fields but had a hard time finding space to showcase our work,\u201d says Temidra. \u201cSo we thought, why not open our own shop?\u201d And Hidden Gem was born, right in their beachside hometown of Southampton, New York.That was March 2019, a year before It All Went Down, but the sisters say that running a housewares business (especially one with an increasingly robust ecomm market) proved pandemic-proof. In fact, the stay-at-home orders increased sales. \u201cPeople being at home more meant they were caring more about what was in their homes, and who was making the items,\u201d says Temidra. The bright colors and patterns you\u2019ll find at Hidden Gem\u2014many of them inspired by the sisters\u2019 Antiguan heritage\u2014feel like the perfect antidote to a long, bleak year-and-a-half of quarantine. \u201cThe Hamptons has a very specific look but we wanted to break that mold and introduce something new,\u201d says Temidra. \u201cThe best compliment we get from people is, \u2018Oh, I wanna live here!\u2019 They step inside our world, and they get it.\u201dRead on for some of the sisters\u2019 favorite items in the shop.Linen ApronTemidra uses her fashion and textiles training to make these linen aprons, which are designed to flow like a dress. \u201cMy mom would host monthly dinner parties in her backyard, but she\u2019d still be cooking as the guests were arriving, coming in and out of the house in a dirty apron,\u201d she says. These aprons are for mom\u2014and anyone who wants to look stylish in the kitchen, even with a spill or two.\u00a0Photograph by Isa ZapataLinen Apron$85 at Hidden GemBent CandlesTanya hand-dips these paraffin candles in an array of bright hues, then bends them into various shapes, so no two are exactly alike. \u201cIf you\u2019re hesitant about adding color and patterns to your space, this is a nice, subtle place to start,\u201d she says.\u00a0Photograph by Isa ZapataBent Candles$28 at Hidden Gem \u2013 Set of 2Evil Eye Dinner Plate\u201cGrowing up, we always had little trinkets and bracelets with the evil eye symbol,\u201d says Temidra. \u201cIt\u2019s for protection from evil spirits and bad energy.\u201d Honeymooning in Western Greece in 2017, she fell in love with the work of a local ceramicist who incorporated the evil eye into his electric blue dishware. It took some convincing, but eventually she was able to set up a direct pipeline to Hidden Gem\u2014the only place you\u2019ll find these items in the U.S.\u00a0Photograph by Isa ZapataEvil Eye Dinner Plate$125 at Hidden GemBone Spice PotThe sisters source many of their products from a small community of artisans in Nairobi, Kenya. \u201cSomehow they found us on Instagram and messaged us during the pandemic,\u201d says Temidra. \u201cWe use these little pots to hold my dad\u2019s special seasoning concoctions at family dinners.\u201dBone Spice Pot$32 at Hidden GemFringe Coasters\u201cOur mom weaves but she wasn\u2019t going to weave coasters for us. She was like, \u2018I have enough on my plate!\u2019\u201d says Temidra. Instead, the shop sources these colorful coasters from the same community of Kenyan artisans that produce their bowls and spice pots. \u201cWe\u2019ve tried bringing muted, neutral colors into the shop but the products just sit there. When people come to Hidden Gem, they\u2019re specifically coming for colors and prints, which is great because that's what we love and what we do best. Validation!\u201d\u00a0Photograph by Isa ZapataFringe Coasters$48 at Hidden Gem \u2013 Set of 4Hand-Dyed Tea TowelsTanya\u2019s hand-dying technique traces back to Antigua, where people make brightly colored costumes for Carnival using a sophisticated free-form tie-dye technique with powdered dyes over ice. It\u2019s messier than the American version of tie-dying, but Tanya says the unique patterns and colors are worth it. \u201cWe like to use these tea towels for just about anything: oversized placemats, gift wrap, or hey, wear one as a shirt!\u201dPhotograph by Isa ZapataHand-Dyed Tea Towels$24 at Hidden Gem12\u201d Sisal BowlThe sisters give the Kenyan artisan group a general color scheme to work with, but otherwise complete creative freedom on the patterns and color combinations of these hand-woven sisal bowls. \u201cThis one\u2019s meant to be a fruit bowl, but it\u2019s almost like a woven sculpture,\u201d says Temidra. \u201cWe like incorporating them as part of a gallery wall to add texture and dimension, especially for people who have kids or are renting out their space, so they don\u2019t have to worry about someone knocking a glass piece off the wall and breaking it.\u201dPhotograph by Isa Zapata12\u201d Sisal Bowl$60 at Hidden GemMulti Color PlacematsTemidra makes these one-of-a-kind placemats out of hemp fabric handspun by Hmong artisans in Thailand. \u201cWhen I'm designing, I'm attracted to texture and color first\u2014I\u2019ll pick out a cool fabric and figure out what to do with it later,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat I love about this one is the really cool pleating.\u201dPhotograph by Isa ZapataMulti Color Placemats$40 at Hidden Gem \u2013 Set of 2Resin Charcuterie BoardsThe sisters have become known in the Hamptons for the wood-and-resin surfboards they design and decorate as wall art. These charcuterie boards are a functional tabletop version, made with mahogany cut and sanded by their brother, Jari Willock. Pouring the mixture of resin and ink is a complicated chemical process that can be dangerous if not done correctly. \u201cUsually, we have minimal control over how the colors flow and blend, but sometimes Tanya uses a hairdryer to control the pattern and create a bubbly, foam-like effect that resembles a bird\u2019s eye view of the ocean.\u201d Sailboat cleats are affixed as handles to build on the nautical theme.\u00a0Photograph by Isa ZapataResin Charcuterie Boards$145 at Hidden GemWood Bottle StopperThese quirky wine corks are made from olive wood in Tunisia. \u201cWhat attracted us to them is that they\u2019re fruit-shaped,\u201d says Temidra. \u201cI love items with some illusion to them, where it takes people a minute to understand what they are. Like, oh wait, that\u2019s a pear!\u201dPhotograph by Isa ZapataWood Bottle Stopper$18 at Hidden GemExplore Bon App\u00e9titCultureShoppingShop TourRecipes you want to make.
