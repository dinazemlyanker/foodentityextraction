But the one that I can\u2019t stop thinking about is the grilled halloumi sandwich at D\u00e9panneur Le Pick-Up, which I tasted on my last trip to Montreal.A d\u00e9panneur is what we call a bodega in New York City, typically stocked with pantry staples and beer. Le Pick-Up turns the concept on its head: It is part-diner, part-convenience store, part-coffee shop, the list goes on. They have local Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois beer and kombucha, and Club Mate from Germany (my favorite), best accompanied by the spicy, crispy home fries that made me shed tears of joy. While I got the Club Chipotle sandwich, a triple-decker of chicken, bacon, lettuce, tomato, and chipotle mayo\u2014classic and well executed\u2014the sandwich I\u2019m calling out here is the halloumi one, and I didn\u2019t even order it!My vegetarian partner did\u2014God bless her\u2014and I had a bite, expecting to be fully underwhelmed. Then I had five more bites. The sandwich was transcendent. Let me break it down for you. First things first, the seeded bread comes toasted (smart!) to support all the fillings. Then, there\u2019s a layer of fatty, tangy halloumi, griddled and golden. On top of that is a generous pile of zingy, mint-laced slaw that perfectly cuts through the meaty cheese and provides much needed crunch. Finally, slathered on both sides of the bread, there\u2019s a harissa-honey mayo situation. This addition gives a sweet, spicy, creamy, smoky finish. There are so many working parts, and each is doing its thing to make this sandwich totally flawless.As you can tell, Le Pick-Up was the highlight of my trip. And since then, my longing for this sandwich in particular has not subsided. But one thing\u2019s for certain: I will be back!Go there: D\u00e9panneur Le Pick-UpExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendMontrealRestaurantsSandwichRecipes you want to make.
