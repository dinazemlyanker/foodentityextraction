If I crave a zingy broth, I\u2019ll opt for a knob of ginger, a halved chile, and a bunch of cilantro. If I want a classic-style soup (with egg noodles, always with egg noodles), I\u2019ll toss in handfuls of parsley, thyme, dill, and lots of black peppercorns. Sometimes I\u2019ll go full-on mama-style and throw a whole chicken in my biggest pot with half an onion and few fat chunks of carrot and celery, cooked until the vegetables are so soft you can sieve them through your teeth.The option to not follow a recipe exactly (or skip it altogether) is why I\u2019ve always preferred cooking to baking, a sport in which precision is next to godliness. So when senior food editor Andy Baraghani asked me to cross-test his Chicken Soup with Caramelized Ginger and informed me that I\u2019d be making a caramel as part of the recipe, the pastry n00b (do people still say that??) in me quaked. (The title suggests you\u2019re caramelizing the ginger like you would onions but no, you\u2019re making a caramel that you combine with ginger for this unexpected but ingenious broth.)Caramelizing things is scary! But I promise this one is quick and painless and will give your finished broth an undercurrent of delicious, dark-sweet complexity that sets it apart from your typical chicken soup. And this isn\u2019t your typical chicken soup. There\u2019s a ton of ginger\u2014a whole 6\" piece\u2014making this a dream sick-day-soup. The caramel mellows out the spice of ginger, leaving an intensely bright, flavorful broth that you\u2019ll want to drink out of a Thermos all day. Plus, it gives you bragging rights, because at the end of it all, you\u2019ll not only know how to make chicken soup, you\u2019ll also know how to make a caramel.You\u2019re going to make what\u2019s called a \u201cwet caramel,\u201d which just refers to a caramel made with sugar and water, as opposed to one made with only sugar (a.k.a. a \u201cdry caramel.\u201d) Adding water to the mixture as it cooks means the sugar is less likely to burn or clump, which means even a pastry dummy like me can handle it. It\u2019s the same method we use to make this silky-smooth caramel sauce, which I\u2019d always been too scared to attempt\u2014before now!A few key steps to success:1. Use a light-colored saucepan with a heavy bottom. The light color of the metal will help you see what\u2019s actually happening to the sugar water (which, FYI, is clear) as it cooks and starts to brown. Being able to see what\u2019s going on during the cooking process is critical. And you want a pan with a heavy bottom so your caramel will cook evenly and be less likely to burn in spots.Alex LauAlex Lau2. Swirl, don\u2019t stir. Stirring the caramel with a spoon as it cooks can cause it to turn grainy. Feel free to stir the sugar initially to dissolve it in the water, but after that use a smooth swirling motion (swish and flick!) to keep things moving along until everything\u2019s nice and golden and you\u2019re ready to add your ginger.Alex Lau3. Don\u2019t step away from the stove. Not to check your phone, not to pee, not for anything! The trickiest part of making caramel is waiting for it to turn an actual caramel color. For most of the cooking time, it\u2019ll look like nothing\u2019s happening. And then you\u2019ll decide you want to step away for \u201cjust a second,\u201d and I guarantee you will come back to a burnt, acrid mess. Remember: Caramel moves pretty fast. If you stop and look around once in a while, you\u2019ll probably burn it.4. Slice the ginger as thinly as possible. Once you make your caramel, you\u2019ll add a handful of ginger coins and cook them until they\u2019re nice and soft and that intensely spicy raw ginger flavor is cooked out a bit. I made the mistake of not slicing the ginger thinly enough when I made this\u2014they ended up a little too crunchy for my liking, but I definitely could have just cooked them for longer.Once you\u2019ve beautifully caramelized your ginger, the rest of the soup is a cinch: garlic, scallions, and cilantro add even more flavor, a chile adds heat, and boneless skinless chicken thighs cook through in minutes. A healthy splash of soy sauce at the end rounds out the flavors. As for dessert: how about caramel?Get the recipe:Chicken Soup with Caramelized GingerA ginger-forward chicken tonic soup that will provide some much-needed relief when you\u2019re not feeling too hot.View RecipeMore comfort food:Explore Bon App\u00e9titSoupGingerChickenRead MorecookingThe Garlic Broth Recipe That Brought Me Back to HealthBy Chris MoroccocookingThis Noodle-y, Herb-Packed Miso Soup Is Filling Enough to Actually Be DinnerBy Sarah JampelcultureBanish That Pesky Cold with this Magical TonicBy Jill Baughman and Vincent CrossRecipes you want to make.
