Parathas come in many shapes, textures, and flavors across Asia\u2014they are perfect for dipping into dals and stews or eating alongside assorted condiments,\u201d contributing writer\u00a0Priya Krishna says. \u201cThis take, which I learned from my aunt Rachna, is really simple: a basic wheat-based dough stuffed with silky spiced potatoes. What makes this particular recipe so great is the ratio of potato to bread; because it\u2019s mostly potato with just a little bread, each paratha is soft, satin-like, and supercharged with flavor. Eat these on their own or with a side of tangy achar and yogurt for dipping. To give your aloo paratha a bit of a kick, add \u00bc cup grated cheddar cheese to each potato ball before you roll them into the whole wheat dough.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Pierce each potato 5 times on each side with a fork, then microwave in a microwave-safe bowl, turning over halfway through, 10 minutes. (Alternatively, place potatoes in a large saucepan without pricking and pour in water to cover. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium and cook until a fork easily pierces flesh, 20\u201325 minutes. Drain, rinse under cold running water, and let cool 10 minutes.)Step 2Peel potatoes (it\u2019s best to do this when they are cool enough to handle but still fairly hot). Transfer to a medium bowl and mash with a potato masher, fork, spoon, or your hands until mostly smooth. Measure out 1\u00bd cups and transfer to a small bowl. If you have any extra, save for filling samosas or pierogi.Step 3Mix 1 cup whole wheat flour, \u00bc tsp. vegetable oil, \u00bc tsp. kosher salt, and \u00bd cup room-temperature water in a medium bowl to combine, then knead until dough is smooth and no dry bits remain. Wrap in plastic (a bowl with a tight-fitting lid will also work) and chill 20 minutes.Step 4Meanwhile, finely crush \u00bd tsp. fennel seeds with a mortar and pestle or crush on a cutting board with a heavy object (like a cast-iron skillet) to as close to a powder as you can get. Chop 1 small handful of cilantro.Step 5Using a fork, mix ground fennel, \u00bc tsp. red chili powder, 2 Tbsp. chopped cilantro, and remaining \u00bc tsp. kosher salt into mashed potatoes in small bowl. Use fork to break up any lumps; your aim is to get potatoes really smooth. (the dough will be hard to roll if the potatoes aren\u2019t smooth enough). Divide into 4 equal portions and roll into balls.Step 6Divide dough into 4 equal portions and roll into balls. Dust work surface with flour and coat each dough ball in flour. Roll each ball into a 6\" circle, dusting with more flour if needed.Photo by Chelsie Craig, Food Styling by Pearl JonesStep 7Working one at a time, place a potato ball in the center of a dough circle and bring sides of dough up and over ball like you\u2019re enclosing a parcel, gathering edges at the top. Pinch together to seal. (Make sure it\u2019s sealed well, otherwise filling will spill out during the rolling process.) Turn ball sealed side down and roll out to an 8\" circle.Photo by Chelsie Craig, Food Styling by Pearl JonesStep 8To cook paratha, pour \u00bc cup vegetable oil in a small bowl. Heat a medium skillet over medium. Brush a paratha with 1\u00bd tsp. oil and carefully place, oil side down, in the pan. (The easiest way to move parathas to the pan is to drape over your palm; this will keep them from losing their shape.) Cook 2 minutes, brush top side with 1\u00bd tsp. oil, and turn over. Continue process of brushing and turning until both sides are golden brown, 2 or 3 more times. Repeat with remaining 3 paratha.Photo by Chelsie Craig, Food Styling by Pearl JonesHow would you rate Aloo Paratha?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (10)Back to TopTriangleAlmost got this right the first time, probably rolled the dough a little too thin and two of the four fell apart a bit while flipping. Used more flour than I expected on the table when kneading and rolling out the dough. \n\nNext time, I will use a little more oil in the batter. Not sure why we're supposed to oil the paratha and not simply put some in the pan (?)\n\nUsed Trader Joe's Cuban Seasoning in the mashed potatoes, that worked nicely, even if it's not authentic.\n\nDan WConnecticut1/17/2021This recipe is a perfect place to start with making parathas- the dough/water/oil proportion always throws me off but this was easy and clear! Once you get the dough, go wild with fillings! This recipe is a bit under spiced than traditional parathas- usually we add finely sliced red onion, green chili (jalepenos even) and a little grated ginger. Top with LOTS of butter/ghee. AnonymousNew York, NY11/17/2020totally achievable, delicious, fun. easy to follow. and my husband loved it. served it with baked rajma. but could\u2019ve eaten on it\u2019s own. 10/10. Anonymouscanada10/13/2020First time making parathas. The dough became difficult to work with after wrapping it around the potato ball. It also stuck to my work surface which complicated picking them up to move to the pan. They were all broken but super tasty! I\u2019d make sure to use good quality spices and use salt as the recipe calls for. Will make again :)  AnonymousAmsterdam10/10/2020These are delicious. I was worried about rolling out the dough with potato inside but I got the hang of it really quickly. The fennel is delicious, and I'm excited to try again and try out different flavors. Anonymousminnesota10/8/2020This is bland and microwaving a potato is just wrong.  Was this tested?AnonymousVirginia10/2/2020Excited to make this!AnonymousChicago, IL10/1/2020I found the dough difficult to work with but was able to finally wrangle it.  But, in the end, not enough flavor and too much frying/oily flavor to make it worth the trouble.  AnonymousSomerville, MA10/1/2020I\u2019ve been making these all week since the recipe came out. I go a little heavy on the fennel and they are so so good!AnonymousLos Angeles9/26/2020super goodAnonymousDC9/24/2020Explore Bon App\u00e9titFlatbreadBreadSouth AsianAsianPotatoVegetableWhole Wheat FlourFlourRusset PotatoSideStarterNut-FreeDairy-FreeBakingRamadanDinnerBasicallyRecipes you want to make.
