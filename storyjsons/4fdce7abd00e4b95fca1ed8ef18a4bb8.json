While working as a bar manager, sommelier, and most recently, beverage director at Tokyo Record Bar and Air\u2019s Champagne Parlor, Berry has also consistently held down the role of activist in the food and beverage space. Recently she\u2019s moved from front of house to center stage, traveling the U.S. speaking on panels about intersectionality within hospitality. We caught up with Ashtin Berry in July at Tales of the Cocktail in New Orleans to get the download on how she incorporates daily reading into her wellness arsenal, the food she loves to eat with champagne, and a skin routine to rival any beauty editor\u2019s.\n\u2014Shanika HillocksWords are an integral part of my work, so reading is one of my biggest self-care practices. I never eat breakfast; it\u2019s just not my thing, but I do like to make sure I\u2019m mentally fed. I\u2019m currently wrapping up Not That Bad by Roxanne Gay, Gendered Spaces by Daphne Spain and Brittney Cooper\u2019s Eloquent Range. When I\u2019m home, my morning ritual includes a pot of tea, often from Mariage Fr\u00e8res. It\u2019s expensive as hell, but I adore them. When I\u2019m not cosseting, a Chinese oolong, or fragrant tea that can last for a second or third cup, is what I enjoy. As the tea steeps, I jump in the shower, and then get to my skincare regimen\u2014more on that later. In lieu of a workout, I listen to trap music accompanied with a good twerk session, which I highly recommend.My other meals lean on the indulgent side. I drink a lot of champagne, so my choices in food tend to reflect what pairs well with a bottle of bubbly. An O.G. grower who is a personal favorite of mine is A. Margaine. For a new-school label, I enjoy Dhondt-Grellet. You\u2019ll be happy if you get your hands on either option. Radishes and whipped butter are generally a snack for me. I used to enjoy caviar potato chips, but my accountant told me to stop acting like I had caviar money, so now I eat a ton of Brothers Food Mart fried chicken (yes, from the gas station) which my mom fusses at me about. I really don\u2019t understand why people won\u2019t let me be great\u2014fried chicken and champagne is a classic. I also love burgers. Like, love them. For hangover-laced mornings, I consume eggs. A seven-minute egg or pickled egg cures all: I swear by it.If travel is on deck for an upcoming panel or business meeting, I\u2019ll look to my article file for three to five pieces I want to read, and archive them for the trip. I'm interested in culture transformation in spaces, and believe conversations about context provide gateways for those shifts. I\u2019m currently in talks about the inclusion of all women of color\u2014Asian, Latina/x, Pacific Islander\u2014in the WOC conversation, not just Black women. I teach that diversity does not always imply inclusivity. Lastly, I acknowledge that reproductive and sexual health as a part of human health is integral to making spaces\u2014hospitality, or otherwise\u2014safer.On a larger scale, I\u2019m invested in conveying that hospitality is a wide world that includes hotel housekeeping staff, event staff, sex workers, and chain and fast food industry workers. The media presents the entire hospitality industry as this craft world\u2014think about any prominent NYC or LA restaurant or bar\u2014where the staff tends to be more homogenous. This disconnect has long-term implications in terms of who continues to get access to valued spaces. If we don\u2019t make it a point to support these underrepresented groups\u2019 progression, we prohibit the whole industry\u2019s growth.For me, social media serves as vehicle to communicate and educate on all of these points. After many text messages and emails asking for reading recommendations, I took to my Instagram to curate a weekly collection of articles. With social media, I\u2019m fostering more in-depth conversations, both inbound and outgoing.Now, back to skin. My skin tells me everything\u2014if I\u2019m eating well and drinking enough water. It\u2019s a gauge for how I\u2019m treating my body. To keep it looking its best, I opt for a mix of serums and Korean beauty products. My current regimen includes The Ordinary\u2019s Caffeine Eye Serum, Corsx Snail Mucin, Marie Veronique Intensive Repair Serum, Mario Badescu Drying Lotion to treat the occasional breakout, and  Dr. Jart brightening and hydration sheet masks.More than books and bottles though, my personal practices place self-awareness at the forefront. I believe that you cannot truly know how to care for yourself if you haven\u2019t been transparent about where you are currently. I like to take a cue from my friends in the theater world and break down the fourth wall. Whether talking to industry colleagues, the audience of a panel, or someone on social media, I make it a point to voice the reasoning behind my words and actions. We all know our ego is a powerful thing. Quieting it is a constant practice but one I highly recommend.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishNew OrleansCocktailInterviewsRead MorecultureMeet the Woman Behind Solange Knowles's Favorite Skincare LineBy Magdalena PuniewskaRecipes you want to make.
