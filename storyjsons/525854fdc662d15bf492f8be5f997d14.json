Up next, Dawn Davis writes about Talia di Napoli frozen pizza.I\u2019m a fan of quality frozen pizza. What\u2019s not to love? But there\u2019s something especially fun about pulling one out of the oven and telling people it was made by master pizzaiolos in Italy a few days earlier. That\u2019s what initially drew my attention to Talia di Napoli, which makes artisanal Neapolitan pizzas using high-quality, locally sourced ingredients, then flash-freezes them at extremely low temperatures to preserve freshness as they make their way from Europe to your kitchen.Talia di Napoli PizzasShop Now at Talia di NapoliAfter one bite of Talia di Napoli\u2019s Margherita pizza\u2014featuring a crispy thin crust layered with fragrant tomato sauce and ultrasmooth mozzarella\u2014I knew it was a cut above your average frozen pie. The pomodoro sauce, made with Italian tomatoes, bursts with flavor, and it also helps that the pizzas don\u2019t include any preservatives, additives, or GMOs. My favorite is the Tartufina pizza, which pairs creamy fior di latte with grated black truffle and porcini mushrooms.Since they only take 10 minutes to cook, Talia di Napoli has become my go-to whenever I need a meal in a pinch. We keep a stash of them in the office for when we don\u2019t have time to go out for lunch or for those days when the test kitchen isn\u2019t cooking up something delicious. They\u2019re satisfying, but with a thin and yielding crust, they won\u2019t completely fill you up\u2014a great snack to put out while dinner party guests are having their aperitifs.What I love most about Talia\u2019s pizzas is that they\u2019re sophisticated yet simple, and there\u2019s an option for everyone, whether you\u2019re vegetarian, lactose-free, or gluten-free. And, of course, there\u2019s nothing more family-friendly than pizza, which means I can pull one out of the freezer whenever the kids tell me they\u2019re hungry. (Pro tip: If you don\u2019t tell them they\u2019re eating mushrooms, they\u2019ll just think the Tartufo is a really yummy cheese pizza.)Explore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingHighly RecommendCultureRecipes you want to make.
