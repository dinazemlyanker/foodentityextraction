RossMay 17, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Alex LauFacebookTwitterEmailI stepped out of the cab and into a pile of slush, looking around the freezing-quiet block as the polar vortex settled in. I felt very alone: the only person on the street (Diversey Avenue) in an unfamiliar neighborhood (Logan Square) in a city (Chicago) far from home, looking for a wine shop I\u2019d never visited, full of people I\u2019d never met. Just as the gutter ice began melting into my boots, my eyes caught a glow in the window of my destination: Diversey Wine.As soon as I opened the door\u00a0of the Chicago wine shop, I was bathed in warmth and welcoming. My\u00a0spoiled Los Angeles\u00a0bones were restored amid the white walls hugged by cozy Douglas Fir shelves lined with the friendly faces of bottles I\u2019d loved, lusted after, or couldn\u2019t wait to meet. It was Diversey\u2019s Sunday tasting, and I found myself in conversations about cameras and cats in circles of strangers who didn\u2019t feel like strangers at all. Bottles were popped and shared. I felt at home.This might all sound hyperbolic\u2014perhaps the high of a good heater or the half dozen tastes of the Australian Lucy Margaux wines talking. But it\u2019s not, and to understand why, you have to get to know Bradford Taylor. Technically, the disheveledly handsome 33-year-old is the wine shop\u2019s owner, but truthfully, he\u2019s a philosopher. Not in the aimless collegiate way that makes eyes roll or blows dinner parties full of hot Nietzschean air, but in true practice that is shaping modern American wine culture.\u201cWine is supposed to make you happy,\u201d Taylor says, casually swirling his glass of Jean Ginglinger\u2019s Pinot Gris around the back table of Diversey Wine the next day. We were alone aside from the hum of the heater, but Taylor radiates so much tranquility and openness, it would be impossible for the walls around him not to reverberate with the same energy. (And I\u2019m saying that as someone who does not own any crystals.)Taylor never planned to open a wine shop, let alone three. After studying literature at Swarthmore College, he spent a year in Paris working at the famous Shakespeare and Company bookshop and hanging at classic wine bars like Le Verre Vol\u00e9, where he began to drink natural wine the way most of us did\u2014without realizing it. In 2012, Taylor was working on his doctoral dissertation on the concept of taste in modernist literature at UC Berkeley and living in Oakland when a visit from his father made him realize how ridiculous it was that every time he wanted to buy wine\u2014the kind of wines he\u2019d fallen in love with in France\u2014he had to drive 30 minutes to Kermit Lynch\u2019s shop. So, with a small loan from his father, he opened his own.Wines on tap at Ordinaire.\nErin KunkelOrdinaire was born in Oakland in 2013 and quickly became the West Coast\u2019s capital of natural wine. As both a store and a bar, it was (and is) the antithesis of what most Americans have experienced when it comes to wine. Unlike the snobby and sterile shops that make you feel like you\u2019re being watched and judged by a side-eyeing suit at a Chanel store, walking through the entrance of Ordinaire feels like stepping into the Cheers you never knew was there.Rather than treating Ordinaire as an isolated experience, Taylor used it as a template to spread natural wine across the country. In 2016, he and Josh Eubank (the importer for Percy Selections), Ordinaire alum Quinn Kimsey-White, and Matt Coelho of the Bay Area\u2013based Woods Beer cofounded Brumaire, the wine-fair turned party in Oakland that brings together natural wine producers from around the world. Now in its fourth year, it sells out in days. In 2018, Taylor opened Diversey Wine in Chicago and became an investor in Los Angeles\u2019 Psychic Wines, owned by Kimsey-White and chef Zach Jarrett. Taylor\u2019s academic work focuses on how taste as a sense can be used to form alternative communities, and his projects are the physical evidence of his philosophies.No matter which of these sister shops you\u2019re in, the selection of natural wines is expansive, and Taylor uniquely emphasizes offering as many releases from a single producer as possible to give customers an opportunity to explore the entirety of a winemaker\u2019s work. In between these lineups, you\u2019ll find those bottles you keep stocked in your fridge and rare releases that only someone like Taylor could be trusted with.The inventory, however, would be meaningless without the company it keeps. This is what has always struck me about Ordinaire: Whether I am sipping or shopping, I never feel like I\u2019m being \u201csold\u201d to. Talking with the staff feels like chatting with a new friend who can\u2019t wait to share a cool find. They scan the shelves and excitedly pull bottles like someone would from a well-curated vinyl collection, eager to showcase an album I\u2019ve never heard of but that\u2019ll stay in my head forever. The seats are filled with regulars and locals, industry folks and winemakers, fans from far and wide. Ordinaire is a communal living room, as encouraging of intimate conversations over candlelight as it is house parties with mariachi bands. Everyone is there for the same reason: because it feels, and tastes, good.Books break up the selection of bottles at Diversey Wine in Chicago.\nPhoto by Alex Lau\u201cWine is supposed to fill you the same way food fills you,\u201d Taylor says. \u201cIt gives you this deep sense of social community that is kind of rare. Bike shops have a similar thing. So do surf shops, coffee shops. It\u2019s little spots where you go to find your people. It\u2019s not a belief system, but a shared ideology.\u201d And what is that ideology? \u201cIt\u2019s not about getting natural wine in as many mouths as possible,\u201d Taylor says, laughing. \u201cIt\u2019s also really important to me that people can come in and get a wine for under $20.\u201d And often those wines are not fully natty, bro. Taylor is against the use of commercial yeast but doesn\u2019t shy away from good budget wines that use sulfur or filtration. \u201cIt\u2019s about thinking of wine as a part of this economic system, and how do you get people into that economy? I remember living in New York, I drank $11 Portuguese wine. It was the only thing I could afford. But it\u2019s how I eventually got into wine. I only got here because of people putting in hard work to find cheap wines that I could actually go and drink.\u201dBut there\u2019s more to it than just value\u2014a pretty good $15 Pinot Noir is not enough to create Taylor\u2019s religious customer base. Any shop can host $10 tastings, but Taylor does it with lineups of Pierre Beauger bottles that would run you between $70 and $100 a pop. He\u2019s known to buy highly allocated wines and, in Eubank\u2019s words, \u201cimmediately run them by the glass for like eight bucks, or maybe just open them for free for some random guy who\u2019s celebrating a win by the San Jose Sharks.\u201d There was also a period where he was sabering \u201cunlimited bottles of every type of Champagne to give away to anyone,\u201d Jarrett recalls. Taylor takes what\u2019s out of reach for consumers and puts it in their hands regardless of cost because to him the community it builds is priceless.On the surface, Taylor\u2019s dedication to idealism over capitalism could seem irrational\u2014one of those things your uncle scoffs at before telling you if you\u2019re not a Republican when you\u2019re old, you don\u2019t have a brain. But Taylor has succeeded precisely because he isn\u2019t choosing idealism over capitalism, but using one to facilitate the other. \u201cIt\u2019s so important for small businesses to realize that what America values is accumulation of capital and entrepreneurship and to use that as a basis for reclaiming society through that back door,\u201d Taylor says. \u201cThat\u2019s how I think of Ordinaire. It\u2019s a business, but just because that\u2019s the only way to do it. It\u2019s the only way to create this community.\u201dA month after my Chicago trip, I was back in Oakland at Ordinaire, two nights before the fourth Brumaire festival. I was in the loft drinking magnums and joking with Eubank about his latest pet peeve of green wines\u2014when grapes are picked early, or \u201cgreen,\u201d to increase acidity. The sea of people in the bar below hit high tide, the whole place swelling with excitement to kick off a weekend celebrating natural wine. It was the kind of moment you might expect the bar\u2019s owner to be relishing in, maybe kicking back with a few good bottles. But Taylor was running around busing tables in track shorts. I finally caught him outside, knowing it would be the only moment I\u2019d have with him all weekend. I don\u2019t know what he poured me, but it didn\u2019t matter\u2014he was most excited to point out the smiling staff of Diversey waving at us from inside the window of Ordinaire. I realized then that it\u2019s not business that created this community: It\u2019s Bradford.Explore Bon App\u00e9titWineSan FranciscoChicagoRead MorerestaurantsAll Chianti Is My Kind of ChiantiBy Marissa A.
