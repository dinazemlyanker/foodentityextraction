Blah oatmeal, powdered protein shakes, piles of egg whites. She had to make weight\u2014otherwise risk losing her world champion title\u2014and the day of the weigh-in, that meant eating as little as possible and sweating it off. So the moment your body needs the nutrition as much as possible, you can\u2019t give it to it.\u201cIt really came down to eating really light,\u201d said Ali, who hung up her boxing gloves in 2007 and this month released her first cookbook, Food for Life. \u201cI ate vegetables, salads, foods that were full of water. And then the day of the fight, sometimes you would get a workout in, go sit in the sauna, but you definitely wouldn't be drinking anything. You would kinda really be dehydrated. So, that\u2019s not healthy, right?\u201dGrowing up, Ali, daughter of Muhammad Ali, saw her father eat whatever he wanted before a match. \u201cHis age group was a really old school, so it was a lot of steak and potatoes and hearty foods, especially with him being a heavyweight. He didn't have to make weight.\u201d But he prized home-cooked meals, especially the soul food cooked by their family\u2019s personal chef, Edith. \u201cHe loved sitting down to his plate and he took his time eating,\" Ali recalled. \"He didn\u2019t rush.\u201dEvery meal Edith made was a spread, like Thanksgiving on a weeknight. \u201cEdith could throw down,\u201d Ali said, laughing. She made fall-off-the-bone baked chicken, buttery sweet monkey bread, creamed corn, mac and cheese\u2014all of it full of flavor and fresh herbs. \u201cIf it was caramelized, it was caramelized to perfection. If it was baked, it was baked to perfection,\u201d said Ali. It\u2019s clear that a lot of Ali\u2019s food memories go back to Edith, and this kind of comforting (but also healthy) family food is at the core of her cookbook.After her final fight in 2007, what Ali learned about nutrition stayed with her. \u201cI was used to eating on a schedule, and used to thinking about how this food is gonna affect my body and fuel my body.\u201d She got into cooking, and even appeared on two episodes of Chopped. Now she eats when she\u2019s hungry. Before her two kids (ages 6 and 9) wake up, she has a cup of strong coffee with creamer and takes a quiet moment. \u201cWhat I do in the morning is really just have gratitude and think about how thankful I am.\u201d Then she\u2019ll make a list of her goals for the day and prepare breakfast for her kids, which might be eggs and turkey bacon, oatmeal, or something she invented called \u201cbreakfast spaghetti\u201d for her very particular 6 year-old (it\u2019s basically carbonara.)Ali herself doesn\u2019t eat until around 11 a.m., usually a big salad with last night\u2019s leftovers, after a workout. \u201cThat drive is always in me to get that hard workout in,\u201d she said. \u201cI have had girlfriends say, 'Hey, you wanna go walking?\u2019 And I\u2019m just not interested. I\u2019m like 'Uh, no, I\u2019m good.\u2019 But they keep inviting me!\u201dInstead, she prefers a HIIT workout on her Peloton bike. \u201cAs a boxer, working out was my job. I'd run in the morning. I would go to the gym in the afternoon to box, which is, like, grueling. Then I would weight train three or four times a week,\u201d she said. \u201cNow, I don't have that lifestyle. When I work out, I\u2019ll do high intensity workouts but for shorter periods of time, and I\u2019m always switching it up.\u201dBut some habits are hard to break, which is why she keeps a heavy bag in her home gym\u2014a workout her body knows by heart. Like her father before her, she \u201cdefinitely\u201d isn\u2019t encouraging her daughter to become a boxer, or her son to become a professional football player (Ali is married to former NFL player Curtis Conway). \u201cThey\u2019re just dangerous sports,\u201d she said, \u201cThey\u2019re high stress on the body and I just wouldn\u2019t want that for them. But obviously I know they\u2019re going to do what their hearts desire, and I\u2019m going to support them.\u201dStill, she\u2019s glad more women are finding their way into boxing gyms and classes for casual fitness. \u201cBoxing is a full body workout and it gives you sense of empowerment, that you can protect yourself,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd I think that people need to feel that, especially women, more now than ever.\u201dBuy Food for Life: Delicious & Healthy Comfort Food from My Table to Yours on Amazon, $20.97.Explore Bon App\u00e9titCookbooksHealthyishprofileRead MorecultureCynthia Erivo On Being a Workout Warrior And Holding Hollywood AccountableBy Claire SaffitzRecipes you want to make.
