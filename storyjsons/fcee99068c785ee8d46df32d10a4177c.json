Summers will have you rooting for a murderous restaurant critic.By Alex BeggsDecember 17, 2020FacebookTwitterEmailFacebookTwitterEmailAll products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Summers\u2019 new novel, A Certain Hunger, went to the place we, Bon App\u00e9tit, and I, writer lady, never go. A place where sex and food entwine so grossly and explicitly that it makes you laugh, scream, and need a drink as stiff as this innuendo. This book is crazy. You have to read it.The premise is: An esteemed old-school restaurant critic loves to kill the men she sleeps with. And eat them. (We\u2019re talking about a pair of braised butt cheeks\u2014\u201droast rump\u201d\u2014here and a skinned tongue there, not like the whole bod. She also cooks them straight-up gourmet: A lover\u2019s liver is turned into p\u00e2t\u00e9 and spread on Tuscan toast.) The book made me...hungry? How? Maybe I have some soul-searching to do.The novel\u2019s narrator, Dorothy Daniels, would probably be delighted to hear this, tapping her fingers together in her cell at Bedford Hills Correctional Facility, where she eats barely edible mush and tells us her story. \u201cYou and I are the same,\u201d she writes. \u201cYou may not admit it aloud, but I know you will read this book and wonder how your lover would taste saut\u00e9ed with shallots and mushrooms and deglazed with a little red wine.\u201dSummers does a pitch-perfect impression of the highfalutin restaurant critic amped up on expensed rib eye and good Barolo, intoxicated by adjectives. It took me a few chapters to get into the narrator\u2019s tone\u2014as lofty as her six-foot frame, as fiery as her red hair\u2014and love for food metaphors (she describes a cop as \u201cworth his weight in crullers\u201d). But once I did, I was rooting for this psychopathic, super-horny murderess until the last page.It\u2019s American Psycho meets Ruth Reichl\u2019s Save Me the Plums. Summers\u2019 knife is twisted in Bret Easton Ellis\u2019s book spine\u2014she credits his influence in her acknowledgments. And, like Reichl\u2014whose writing celebrates food\u2019s kinky side\u2014Dorothy earns the fat paychecks of magazine writing in the \u201980s and \u201990s, then adapts, and blogs, through the early 2000s. It\u2019s a nostalgia Negroni: bitter, bracing, and barely sweet. But I skimmed that part\u2014I\u2019d rather get straight to the murder of men than relive the slow bloodletting of the publishing industry.We know that Dorothy gets caught eventually. But how? That question keeps you turning page after gory page. Where other thrillers string us along to figure out whodunnit, as we follow Dorothy\u2019s murder streak, we\u2019re wondering: But how did she cook this one? Each kill is more inventive and delicious (sorry, but true), than the last. It\u2019s notable how often duck fat appears, considering there\u2019s a jar of it in my fridge right now...Summers writes in her acknowledgments that the book was rejected by 25 publishers. Too lovable a cannibal? Too many references to the narrator\u2019s labia? Too bad. It was ultimately published by Unnamed Press\u2014and was almost immediately sold out on Amazon.A Certain Hunger will have you thinking about the taste of human flesh deglazed in red wine, which feels like a nearly illegal sentence to write. Go to the dark place and let it rattle you. The book also sparked a minor personal existential crisis about how I write about food. What are my limits? I want to compare these Trader Joe\u2019s smoked salmon \u201cfleurettes\u201d to labium, which they resemble uncannily, so what\u2019s holding me back? When did my food writing become so PG-prudish? For a brief moment, as I, yes, devoured, this book, I indulged in the possibility of going there.A Certain Hunger$26 at Amazon$23 at BookshopExplore Bon App\u00e9titBooksRecipes you want to make.
