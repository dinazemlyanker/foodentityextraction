Armstrong Roberts/ClassicStockFacebookTwitterEmailEvery week, Healthyish editor Amanda Shapiro talks about what she's seeing, eating, watching, and reading in the wellness world and beyond. Pro tip: If you sign up for the newsletter, you'll get the scoop before everyone else.Healthyish friends,This week on ye olde site, Maggie Lange talks to adrienne marie brown, the writer, black feminist, and social justice activist whose recent book, Pleasure Activism: The Politics of Feeling Good, has everyone I know buzzing about \u201crelationship anarchy\u201d and trying to get their hands on psychedelic mushrooms. brown\u2019s thesis is that pleasure is a form of liberation, and that working toward justice can be one of the most joyful experiences of our lives.I can\u2019t stop thinking about this book, so I was thrilled to hear more from brown, who writes so clearly (and with a sense of humor) on subjects that might otherwise seem inaccessible or academic. She talks about saying \u201cyes\u201d to coincidence and how she deals with activist guilt, that feeling that you can never rest and never do enough. But my favorite part is her answer to the fill-in-the-blank, \u201cThe last things to bring me peak glee are\u2026\u201dWhen communities I love act in solidarity with each other. The BOLD Harlem Renaissance costume party. Getting lost in a baby's eyes, or a child's plans for the day. Dancing, like private music-video emo dancing. The last thing was looking at myself naked in the mirror and feeling aroused. I had to surrender so many wrong thoughts to begin to see.If you need me, I\u2019ll be getting that last line tattooed somewhere.I\u2019m also reading\u2026Amanda Chicago Lewis, a friend and talented journalist, on the Lyft ride she took that turned into a traumatic brain injury, and the strange tendency that many of us have to tell ourselves we\u2019re fine because we want it to be true.Jia Tolentino on religion and ecstacy, because duh. Have you pre-ordered her book yet?From a few months ago, but this article on intentional forgetting resurfaced via Rachelle Robinett\u2019s newsletter last week. The writer takes a drug that has a side effect of memory loss to erase a failed relationship from her mind and...it worked. \u201cFor a while afterward, I couldn\u2019t remember anything other than her voice and the shape of her mouth.\u201d But, as anyone who\u2019s seen Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind can tell you, forgetting isn\u2019t always a blessing.Healthyish enchiladas, on the other hand? A blessing 100 percent of the time.Until next week,Amanda ShapiroHealthyish EditorExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishHealthyish NewsletteressayRead MoreLifestyleThe Privilege of Feeling GoodBy Amanda ShapiroRecipes you want to make.
