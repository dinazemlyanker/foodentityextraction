Spicy, pungent kimchi plus smooth cream cheese, topped with a scallion salad\u2014on toast. It works.Ingredients4 servings4oz. cream cheese, room temperature\u00becup finely chopped kimchi; plus more for serving (optional)2scallions, thinly sliced on a diagonal1cup cilantro leaves with tender stems\u00bdlimeKosher salt4\u00be\"-thick slices country-style bread, grilled or toastedChili oil and toasted white sesame seeds (for serving)PreparationStep 1Mix cream cheese and \u00be cup kimchi in a medium bowl.

We had this as a late, light dinner; it was exactly the thing we needed! Couldn't find the cilantro I thought I had, so used a combo of mint and basil from the garden \u2014 just fine. Grilled homemade ww sourdough in cast iron pan w/ mix of butter + olive oil; \u201clady sauce\u201d chili crisp on top = perfection. (Only wish I had thought of adding a slice of avo like another commenter did \u2014 next time!)typeforbreakfastNew Haven, CT7/9/2021More than the sum of its parts. No scallions, but put a slice of avocado on top of each slice, after plain cilantro, then sprinkled with lime juice, sea salt, chili oil and toasted sesame seeds. Made a great lunch alongside a salad. FranMexico3/13/2021Wow just what I was looking for. AnonymousKent, England12/28/2020One of my favorites. I make the kimchi mix first, then pan-fry my bread in olive oil and top with a poached egg for a heartier breakfast. Chili crisp like Lao Gan Ma or even Trader Joe's brand goes so well on top. So freaking good. jelfersSan Francisco, CA11/6/2020Liked but didn\u2019t love. Giving five stars anyway because I think the fault may well be with me not having all the ingredients (no chili oil or sesame seeds) or the ones I used not being in their prime. I recommend starting with a quarter lime and no salt on your salad and trying it, I found those flavors a little overpowering. I had it on a poppyseed bagel and think it would\u2019ve been even better on garlic, everything, or sesame. Gonna get myself over to H Mart so I have chili oil and sesame seeds for next time. BananaMartiniElkins Park, PA 10/29/2020Andy strikes again. This is a quick meal I whip over lunch and I usually have most of the ingredients on hand already (win-win). I find it a nice recipe to brighten up the ongoing WFH dayzzz. I can see these as cute little crostinis for sharing too.stephaniedarcy14527Seattle, WA8/18/2020I love kimchi and am honestly always looking for a way to eat as much as possible and call it a meal. Can\u2019t wait to make this again.kyliedixonVancouver5/26/2020I find myself craving this often. Such a good, adaptable recipeAnonymousRedondo Beach, CA5/25/2020I was a bit skeptical at first but then I thought eh wth. Turns out it was sour, and spicy, and creamy, and he's right, it somehow works. Even though my dumb*ss stirred the salad in the kimchi cream cheese mixture \ud83d\ude11 it was still tasty. The only thing I would give advice on is that if it's recently fermented kimchi you can follow the recipe as is, but if your kimchi has been fermenting long maybe cut back on the amount a little bit unless you can handle the sourness.munirahalhabshiKuala Lumpur, Malaysia8/27/2019I add kimchi to an otherwise boring turkey sandwich . . . and maybe some radish sprouts.  I confess I read but have not tried the recipe.  Same idea so I give it 5 stars.SuraWLoa Angeles, Ca6/23/2019just schmear some crunchy p.butter (almond buttah works too) on the toast/bread, top with kimchi -- munch, crunch away together.AnonymousSeoul6/23/2019Oh my gosh, this recipe is so good!! I had been looking for something that I could eat for breakfast that was not a donut or something similarly sweet but also wasn't just eggs and this turned out to be perfect. Definitely recommend!AnonymousFargo, ND1/7/2019I subbed the cream cheese for smashed avocado and it was delicious. Can't stop making it, plus it makes it dairy-free for those of us who avoid it.AnonymousDurango, CO12/3/2018This is an awesome recipe but I highly suggest making this creme cheese at least one day in advance so the flavors meld together. It would have made the toast so much tastier!caitlin57Napa, CA11/20/2018Explore Bon App\u00e9titToastCream CheeseCheeseEasyQuickSnackHealthyishBreakfastLunchRecipes you want to make.
