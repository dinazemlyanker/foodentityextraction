Then he met chef Pasquale Benso.By Barry Switzer, as told to Greg ElwellApril 16, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Rachel MaucieriFacebookTwitterEmailWelcome to Red Sauce America, our coast-to-coast celebration of old-school Italian-American restaurants.I came to Oklahoma in 1966 with Jim Mackenzie, as an assistant coach for the University of Oklahoma football team, 53 years ago this January. We didn\u2019t have, really, any place to eat. Most of the restaurants were out on Highway 77. We were still in the boondocks. But in 1972, there was an Italian gentleman who came from Brooklyn named Pasquale Benso. But everyone called him Patsy.I asked him what brought him to Norman and he said he\u2019d read that in Oklahoma, they don\u2019t know good Italian food: \u201cAll they know is, open a can of Chef Boyardee and pour some thick ketchup over spaghetti.\u201dSo he opens a restaurant called Casa di Vinci. He was trying to educate people on the finer Italian dishes, but they didn\u2019t like it. They all wanted Chef Boyardee.He was so entertaining. You just marveled at his humor and his accent and his dialogue. In 1977, he opened this new place, Othello\u2019s, and we became very close. I went to Italy with him probably six or seven times to his hometown of Mola di Bari. This was back in the \u201980s and \u201990s. He made me a fan of Italy.Welcome to the Table of Truth.\nPhoto by Rachel MaucieriIn 1980, I became single and I ate here every friggin\u2019 night with Patsy at the Table of Truth. It was a small booth with a clear view back into the kitchen. Patsy named it the Table of Truth because it had all these cracks\u2014he said, \u201cYou tell a lie at the table and it cracks.\u201dThe place would be packed, but nobody could sit there except for Patsy and his friends. People would come in and the waiter would say, \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d and they\u2019d say, \u201cI want what Coach Switzer is having,\u201d because they knew Patsy himself fixed the dinner we were eating in the back.He couldn\u2019t afford to put the food he made for himself on the buffet line. It was a home-cooked meal every night. I\u2019d come in and say, \u201cWhat are we having?\u201d and go back sometimes and watch him cook. He\u2019d make baccal\u00e0 and things that he\u2019d been cooking all his life. That\u2019s what made this table special. Everybody knew what we were eating was different.When I coached the Sooners at OU, I used to bring the other coaches on staff here. Mike Leach, Bob Stoops. Pretty soon they became regulars too. I didn\u2019t want the damn players in here, though. This was the coaches\u2019 place!Everybody knew Patsy and loved him. He was a magnet. People were just drawn to him. You\u2019d meet him one time and you wanted to come back. When I was later the head coach of the Dallas Cowboys, owner Jerry Jones would ask Patsy to come down to fix dinner for him at his mansion in Dallas, which he did on several occasions. I even took him with me to the Super Bowl in 1996 when we beat the Steelers. I looked up at the end of the game and somehow he\u2019d gotten on the sidelines and was standing next to me. He didn\u2019t know a friggin\u2019 thing about football, but I said, \u201cWell, Patsy? You want to go in and play the final down?\u201dAs he was getting older, Patsy wanted to move back to Italy, but me and a couple of guys convinced him to stay and open up a supper club where he could cook whatever he wanted.When Othello\u2019s was hit by lightning and burned down in 2017, the new owners found the plaque for the Table of Truth in the rubble. When they rebuilt and reopened, they put the table back in the same spot. Patsy\u2019s not with us anymore, but even when the restaurant is busy, I\u2019ve still got a table waiting for me.Greg Elwell is the Eater-in-Chief of iateoklahoma.com and research editor for Oklahoma Today magazine.Explore Bon App\u00e9titRestaurantsItalian AmericanRed SauceOklahomaRead MorerestaurantsRed Sauce AmericaBy Bon App\u00e9titRecipes you want to make.
