It was a classic meet-cute. They were unassuming in their simplicity\u2014100 percent cotton, a soft white with a distinctive herringbone weave and snappy blue stripe. They weren\u2019t like those other kitchen towels from back home, those awkwardly large, overly thick, hopelessly linty decorative towels that sported pumpkins in the fall, tulips in the spring. Those towels were for show, mere accessories for the oven door. But these Zeppoli kitchen towels were everything I\u2019d ever wanted from a kitchen towel and more. I\u2019d fallen hard.Zeppoli Classic Kitchen Towels (15-Pack)$20 $17 at AmazonThey\u2019re simply the best. Better than all the rest.Zeppoli kitchen towels are the apex of towel functionality. They\u2019re super absorbent, ready to tackle spills and splatters. They\u2019re the perfect size and weight\u2014definitely not bulky, but thick enough to handle a hot pan. Because they don\u2019t shed, they\u2019re also an ideal dish towel, so you can dry your glasses without leaving loose fibers all over your clean stemware. And no lint means you can sub them in for paper towels when a recipe calls for pressing the water out of tofu or patting dry slices of salted squash. They\u2019re everything you need and nothing you don\u2019t.Any way you fold them, they're still just the best.\nDon\u2019t I know you from somewhere?Even if you\u2019ve never worked in a restaurant kitchen and had the distinct pleasure of starting your shift with a clean stack of these towels on your station, you\u2019ve probably encountered them before. You know that rustic-chic, no-tablecloths, fine-casual type of restaurant? The one with vintage bric-a-brac on the walls and chicken liver mousse on the menu? Can you picture the napkin that\u2019s on the table, right beneath the Mason jar water glass? That\u2019s right: Some version of the same single-striped kitchen towels I\u2019ve been describing. I\u2019m not saying your dining table should cosplay as a late aughts farm-to-table restaurant, but I am saying that these kitchen towels are lightweight and handsome enough to do double duty as the cloth napkins you have always thought about buying but never got around to. Very French bistro.So if you buy yourself a set of these, not only will you have solved your kitchen towel problem, but you\u2019ll also have morphed into the type of person who has matching napkins for a dinner party. TWO. FOR. ONE. BABY. Listen: You have a combination phone case and wallet, because you\u2019ve only got so many pockets, and cargo shorts are not coming back, no matter what your cousin thinks. (Editor\u2019s note: this piece was originally published in 2018. We regret to inform you that cargo shorts are back.) You buy combination moisturizer and sunscreen because why have two bottles when one will do the trick? So why buy kitchen towels and cloth napkins separately when there exists a product that a) serves both functions extremely well, b) is reasonably chic, and c) costs about a dollar?I'll say it again louder. Each towel costs about $1!A 30-pack of Zeppoli Classic white kitchen towels is going to run you about $31 on Amazon. One singular buck for the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of kitchen towelry that also doubles as table linen? This is a tremendous deal. Perhaps you\u2019re thinking, thirty kitchen towels? Isn\u2019t that a lot? Not if you\u2019re immediately setting aside a dozen for use as napkins (these are for company, not for mopping up red wine spills) and also trying to kick your paper towel habit. Keep a stack on hand for wiping down countertops, a stack for drying dishes, and a stack for throwing over your shoulder while cooking. In fact, I might argue that it\u2019s impossible to have too many kitchen towels\u2014at least not if we\u2019re talking about the best kitchen towels known to man.Editor\u2019s Note: This article was originally published July 19, 2018.Explore Bon App\u00e9titBasicallyShoppingCleaningRecipes you want to make.
