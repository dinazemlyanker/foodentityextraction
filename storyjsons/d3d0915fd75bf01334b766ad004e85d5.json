If you sign up for our newsletter, you\u2019ll get her letter before everyone else.Why did you join Bon App\u00e9tit? That\u2019s the question I\u2019ve gotten the most since I started at Bon App\u00e9tit almost two months ago. It\u2019s a big question to answer because there are so many reasons, but I always start by talking about how good the team here is. The staff is so talented and has so many big ideas, and I can\u2019t wait for us to unveil all of them to the world. I also say that I\u2019m here because I love good stories and great recipes and want to share as many of them with as many people as possible, and at BA that means not just on the website but also in the magazine, on our social channels, and across video and all entertainment platforms. Which brings me to today, when we\u2019ve just relaunched our YouTube channel.Over on YouTube, you can see three new videos: One with test kitchen director Chris Morocco cooking through his weeknight meatball recipe; another with a new host, chef Chrissy Tracey, who walks us through her vegan take on fried chicken (using oyster mushrooms!); and a third that features a conversation with chef Marcus Samuelsson, who is our new global adviser, incoming editor in chief Dawn Davis, who starts next month, and me, about our perspective on food and what we hope to bring to BA\u2014and our morning routines. We wanted to debut all three of these videos on the same day because we hope they show our audience\u2014all of you\u2014the breadth of what we are trying to do. We hope to showcase both new and familiar faces, all doing the things they do best: making food and talking us all through it\u2014and having a great time while they\u2019re at it.Want this letter before it hits the website?\u00a0Sign up for our newsletter!I really hope you like what you see today, over the next few weeks, and into the future. I hope these new videos bring you joy, whether they remind you of your favorite recipes and techniques or teach you something new. Dawn, Marcus, and I are all still extremely new to BA, but we are so committed to learning together with the rest of the staff to get things right. We are looking forward to growing our video program, learning as we go, and trying new things\u2014all rooted in the recipes and food stories you\u2019ve come to know and love on Bon App\u00e9tit, but with some new perspectives and a lot of surprises to come.
