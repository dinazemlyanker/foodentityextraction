Your home is likely already filled with them, but we don\u2019t always give edible plants the same real estate as giant fig trees and ferns. For all your basil and cilantro, I advocate getting a nice planter like Light + Ladder\u2019s sculptural Vayu planter.Most planters are quite uniform: round and consistent. What makes Light + Ladder\u2019s planters so striking is that their surface plays with dimension, resisting the typical houseplant-pot dogma with designs reminiscent of 20th-century brutalist architecture. Sweeping platforms wrap around the planter\u2019s walls and the result is something that\u2019s both awe-inspiring and calming, a feeling we could all use in the kitchen these days.Farrah Sit, the designer behind Light + Ladder, creates many beautiful objects for the home, but she thinks her planters are the ones with the most avid following because her love of gardening is apparent in the design. \u201cThe aesthetic [of the planters] was an expression of that focused concentration and peace that you feel when you\u2019re gardening,\u201d she told me. \u201cAs I was taking care of a small veggie farm on my roof, at a particular time in my life when I was trying to figure things out, it gave me such a sense of peace. I wanted to bring that feeling to the planter design.\u201dMany of us are staying inside our homes now more than ever, and I not only find some solace in these beautiful planters that keep me company, but I\u2019m also able to use them to cultivate a micro-relationship with the world. I\u2019m growing my own food at a small scale and engaging with the ecosystem in a new way. And when my tasks and days bleed together, I find that plants are more reassuring timekeepers than calendars and clocks.Photo courtesy Light \\+ Ladder / Brooke Holm\u00a0VAYU Ceramic Tabletop Planter$80 at Light + LadderExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendherbShoppingRead MorecultureThis Granny Cart Is My Saving Grace Right NowBy Meryl RothsteincultureMy Label Maker Lets Me Pretend That Everything Is Under ControlBy Sarah JampelcultureThis Extremely Precise Electric Kettle Grounds Me in the MorningBy Rachel KartencultureI Never Knew I Needed an Office Toaster Oven Until This One Came Into My LifeBy Annalee SoskinRecipes you want to make.
