Like: I don\u2019t burn as many calories in my favorite workout class as I thought. (Sigh.) I\u2019m far too competitive when it comes to step challenges. (Sorry, not sorry.) And I am a very restless sleeper.I\u2019ve always kind of known this was true. I often struggle to fall asleep, I toss, I turn, and, according to my Fitbit, I wake up between six and seven times each night. I was already always searching for sleep-positive products, but, after seeing my Fitbit data, my quest intensified. Whether it be a meditation app on my iPhone or an essential oil diffuser on my nightstand, I probably own it. But of all my sleep-related purchases, my weighted blanket stands alone.For those who have never heard of this cozy commodity, weighted blankets are exactly what they sound like\u2014blankets with additional, evenly distributed weight. This extra weight (which typically ranges between 5 and 25 pounds) provides a firm but gentle squeeze to those snuggled underneath and subsequently calms the nervous system and eases body tension. Because of these therapeutic effects, weighted blankets have long been used by people with autism, but they\u2019ve been gaining popularity with adults with sleep problems like me.I started using a weighted blanket three months ago and since then, my overall sleep has significantly improved. I\u2019m an overthinker, and my thoughts tend to speed up before bed. But after a few minutes underneath my blanket, my heart rate slows, my body relaxes, and I feel literally grounded. I definitely fall asleep faster than I would without it...as evidenced by the fact that I\u2019ve watched significantly less Friends on Netflix in the past three months.Using my weighted blanket also stops me from moving around in my sleep. While in the past I\u2019ve been a chronic side-flipper, it\u2019s now common for me to wake up in the same position that I fell asleep in. Of course, the immobilizing aspect of sleeping underneath an additional 15 pounds plays a role here, but I also don\u2019t feel the need to move as much when I\u2019m swaddled (and relaxed) underneath my blanket.I bought my first weighted blanket on Amazon, but I was quickly converted to the Gravity Blanket, the brand my boyfriend bought. The Gravity Blanket is the holy grail of weighted blankets. It provides all the same benefits of an average blanket, but it\u2019s softer, it stays cooler throughout the night, and its weight remains more evenly distributed. While the Gravity Blanket is more expensive than others, it\u2019s my favorite of the weighted blankets that I\u2019ve tried.For the past three months, I have slept with the weighted blanket almost every night. I have also convinced three friends, three coworkers, and one family member to buy one for themselves. While the idea of being crushed by a 15-pound weight while you sleep does seem a bit counterintuitive at first, I can\u2019t imagine going to bed without my weighted blanket. Now if only I could get one in a travel size\u2026Buy it: Baloo Soft 15lb Weighted Blanket, $170All products featured on Healthyish are independently selected by our editors.
