After all, our bodies and emotions are inextricably linked. \u201cWhen we\u2019re sad, we crave foods that evoke comfort and nostalgia,\u201d says Kacie Carter, holistic nutritionist, chef, and co-owner of Echo Park-hotspot Honey Hi. \u201cOften these are junk foods that only increase inflammation, which exacerbates those sad feelings.\u201d Which is to say we should be extra thoughtful about what we consume when we\u2019re having a rough day. That umpteenth order of takeout this week or box of M&Ms may give your dopamine levels a bump when you\u2019re feeling low, but the reprieve, no matter how tasty, tends to be short-lived. So the next time you\u2019re feeling moody AF and find yourself reaching for a snack, give one of these expert-approved hormone-balancing foods a try.When you\u2019re sad:Instead of reaching for candy and other carb-heavy options that\u2019ll make your blood sugar spike followed by a crash, give yourself something sweet and full of natural fiber like dark berries, suggests Pasadena-based holistic health coach Samantha Walker. Nuts, meals with leafy vegetables (kale, spinach), and whole grains (quinoa) can also help boost serotonin levels in the brain and rein in fluctuating moods as it takes the body longer to digest.When it\u2019s that time of the month:During the week of your cycle, incorporating hormone-balancing foods that are high in magnesium, such as raw cacao, avocados, or almonds can help ease cramping and bloating says Lindsey Smith, health coach and author of Eat Your Feelings: The Food Mood Girl\u2019s Guide to Transforming Your Emotional Eating. If you feel up to preparing a proper meal in between binge-watching shows and cursing the agony that is owning a uterus for those 3-6 days, Walker suggests a simple baked salmon fillet, zucchini saut\u00e9ed in coconut oil with spinach, and a goat cheese salad drizzled with extra virgin olive oil. \u201cThe healthy fats from the salmon, coconut oil, and olive oil help to keep the body satiated as it works to break down the healthy fats. The spinach provides a large variety of vitamins, including magnesium which [people who get their period] can run low on during their menstrual cycle.\u201dWhen you\u2019re anxious or stressed:A warm decaf green tea with a squeeze of lemon and honey, paired with a handful of deep breaths into the belly, will help ease our body or mind when we are feeling anxious says Walker. Since our body releases \u201cfight or flight hormones\u201d (adrenaline, cortisol and/or norepinephrine) when feeling anxious, it\u2019s best to avoid too much caffeine, as it may unintentionally heighten the unpleasant effects of those hormones. If you\u2019re feeling stressed, adding GABA-boosting foods, such as walnuts, broccoli, or even a glass of oolong tea can go a long way, says Smith. \u201cGABA [short for gamma-aminobutyric acid, a neurotransmitter that provides a natural calming effect on the body and mind] is responsible for helping your brain shut down activity, which can help give your stressful brain the proper rest it needs.\u201dWhen you\u2019re angry:A falling out with a good friend, a stressful work incident, or a romantic partner driving you nuts are all scenarios we\u2019ve likely attempted to eat through (read: inhale copious amounts of unhealthy food, snacks, and desserts to feel less ughhh). As Smith puts it, when you want something in the immediate, eating quick and easy snacks that\u2019ll give your body the nutrients it needs to start calming down are a good way to go. Try almonds, bananas, an apple with peanut butter, or even an egg.When you\u2019re underslept, or depression fatigue is hitting hard:Seek foods with a high level of choline (a macronutrient linked to brain development, nerve function, and energy levels), such as pasture-raised egg yolks, salmon, grass-fed animals, liver, chickpeas, and sunflower lecithin suggests Carter. \u201cMost importantly, incorporate these foods into a meal that brings you joy and lifts your spirit. How and who you eat with is just as important as what you eat when you\u2019re feeling bummed out.\u201dBoost your mood with salmon, walnuts, and whole grainsRoasted Salmon with Celery and Bulgur SaladFor this roasted salmon recipe, finely chopping the walnuts, preserved lemon, and golden raisins gets them into every mouthful.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishRead MorecookingOn Breaking Food Rules and Learning to Cook the Food You LoveBy Alison CarrollRecipes you want to make.
