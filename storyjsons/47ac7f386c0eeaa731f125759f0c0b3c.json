Like a furnace, in sub-30\u00b0 temperatures, I would just burn it off. (That\u2019s how it how works, right?)I wanted my pork and beans pasta.Ever since I happened upon this dish a year ago, I keep coming back to it. Partly because it\u2019s so damn easy. I swing by the market after work and grab two Italian sausages, a jar of cannellini beans (though, any canned white beans would do), and a bottle of pur\u00e9ed tomatoes.Want this letter before it hits the website? Sign up for our newsletter!I make the sauce in one big saut\u00e9 pan, in not much time at all. First, I remove the sausages from their casings and brown the meat in some olive oil. Then in goes some smashed garlic, till gently browned. And then the beans.Do you ever add beans to your pasta? You should try it. Canned or cooked from dried, they lend a creamy richness to your sauce that\u2019s deeply satisfying.After the beans and sausage and garlic have had a chance to hang out for a while and come to temperature, I hit the mixture with a splash of pur\u00e9ed tomatoes.

Same technique, but I skip the tomato pur\u00e9e and throw in a large bunch of nutrient-rich kale, which gets all wilty and glossy and gorgeous.If you make either of these pastas\u2014and I highly suggest you do\u2014you\u2019ll realize that beans, even pantry-friendly canned ones, absolutely belong in your pasta arsenal.
