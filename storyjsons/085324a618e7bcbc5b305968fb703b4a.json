It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.My own ancient grainsThere used to be a tiny restaurant in New York called Risottoria. They served approximately 37 different varieties of risotto and a pretty good squid salad. (No relation to Rice to Riches, the place that sells 37 flavors of rice pudding.) We ordered takeout risotto, lol, from that place all the time. But this week we wanted to recreate the mushy magic\u2014and use up a cup and a half of years\u2019 old arborio rice\u2014and so we made BA\u2019s Best Risotto, recipe by Carla Lalli Music. Unlike my previous experiences making risotto, you cook the topping, crispy mushrooms, separate. And instead of slowly hydrating the rice with stock, you use salty water (easy!). It ended up being the creamiest risotto I\u2019ve ever had. The crispy-okay-sorta burnt mushrooms (I used dried mushrooms, they cooked faster than I expected) kept it from having that congealed wobbly mush texture of the takeout risotto we loved dearly. Now what do I do with half a pint of split peas?Get the recipe: Risotto with Mushrooms and ThymeWant this letter before it hits the website?

First, I averted someone\u2019s unnecessary shopping trip by ordering seven GIANT, perfect avocados from \u201cavocado guy,\u201d an avocado delivery man. Second, I ran into my favorite two gentlemen on our building\u2019s roof. When I\u2019m doing my day\u2019s end yoga (me, laying on a mat, taking a nap), they\u2019re watching the sunset and drinking cold vodka martinis. From a seven foot distance, we talk movies, recipes, the flexibility of hips. This week Raoul was making stuffed cabbage and suggested the 1942 film To Be or Not To Be, a ...comedy\u2026.about Nazis...with Carole Lombard. Added to my list!We have a wonderful new stuffed cabbage recipe, by the way (pictured above).Photo by Laura MurrayWho is this fat daddioWhen Basically ran a story about Fat Daddio cake pans I couldn\u2019t stop wondering, who is Fat Daddio? But then I got distracted by the detail in the story that Sohla El-Waylly made her own 40 LAYER, 8-tier wedding cake. \u201cIt was s\u2019mores flavored,\u201d Sohla told me. \u201cGraham and chocolate cakes, graham cracker streusel, chocolate ganache, and marshmallow fluff buttercream.\u201d Damn, Sohla!!Read more: You Need a Better Cake Pan\u2014Specifically, A Fat Daddio's Cake PanMood of the weekPhoto by H. Armstrong Roberts/ClassicStock/Getty ImagesReader mail of the weekLee in Maine writes in: \u201cIn response to the mention of \u2018ask for help\u2019 in the article on advice to newbie chefs, I have a cautionary tale. Some years ago, during my struggling attempts to begin to cook, the term \u2018al dente\u2019 was new to me. I called a good friend and asked her, \u2018who is Al Dente?\u2019 To this day, probably 25 years later, both she and my wife still tell the story.\u201d(Letter has been edited for space.)Unnecessary TikTok of the weekSuddenly craving Ortega tacos.Unnecessary meme of the weekUnnecessary food feud of the weekUnnecessary food feud of the weekYou\u2019re either a person who has no qualms snacking on a video chat because a person\u2019s gotta snack\u2014or you\u2019re a person who wouldn\u2019t dare chomp on raisins during a staff-wide meeting. We have a big Wednesday meeting and this week, everyone was instructed to bring a snack so I could take a screenshot. Jesse Sparks had a thick slice of peanut butter toast made with homemade honey wheat bread, and he took one loooooong, dramatic bite because he\u2019s a TEAM PLAYER. Obviously he\u2019s pro-snack. \u201cSnacking makes it feel more like tea time and less like work,\u201d said Christina Chaey, who had to leave the Zoom temporarily because she was CHOKING ON A RAISIN. \u201cIf you hold the meeting during lunching hours (12-2),\u201d warned Emily Schultz, \u201cexpect me to come with food!\u201d Molly Baz had thoughts: \u201cDepends on the company you keep! If you wouldn\u2019t walk up to someone\u2019s desk whilst snacking then you have no biz snacking in their Zoom.\u201d Alex Delany lives by the \u201cno talking with your mouth full of food\u201d law, which is reasonable on Zoom and beyond. But philosopher Hilary Cadigan has feelings worth chiseling in stone: \u201cLife\u2019s hard; snack if you wanna.\u201dRead more: Is It Ever Okay...To Hide Special Treats From Your Roommates in Isolation?Now I\u2019m gathering etiquette questions on the theme of PICNICS for a very future issue, hopefully, for a time when we have picnics again.
