Yep, we couldn\u2019t think of a reason either. It may look like a lot of sauce, but trust us, you\u2019ll want to drown your cake in it and save some for snacking later\u2014it\u2019s that addictive.Ingredients8 servingsCakeNonstick vegetable oil spray2cups all-purpose flour, plus more for pan1\u00bdcups (packed) dark brown sugar1\u00bdtsp. baking powder1tsp. ground cinnamon1tsp. kosher salt\u00bdtsp. baking soda1cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, cut into pieces, room temperature1cup sour cream1tsp. vanilla extract3large eggs6oz.

Medjool dates, pitted, tornSpecial EquipmentA 10-cup Bundt panPreparationCakeStep 1Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 350\u00b0. Coat Bundt pan with nonstick spray, then lightly dust with flour, tapping out excess.Step 2Beat brown sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, salt, baking soda, and 2 cups flour in the large bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment on low speed until combined (or use a hand mixer and large bowl). Add butter (make sure it\u2019s at room temperature) and beat on medium-low speed until mixture resembles coarse sand. Add sour cream and vanilla and continue to beat, increasing speed from medium-low to medium as the ingredients begin to incorporate, until batter is thick and smooth, about 1 minute. Scrape down sides of bowl. Reduce mixer speed to medium-low, add 1 egg, then increase speed to medium and beat 30 seconds. Repeat with remaining 2 eggs, reducing speed to medium-low after each addition, then increasing speed to medium-high and beating for 30 seconds (if you beat on medium-high speed from the get-go, you risk losing some of the batter; this ensures nothing flies out of the bowl). Scrape down sides of bowl again. Reduce speed to low, add dates, and beat until incorporated, about 30 seconds longer.Step 3Scrape batter into prepared pan; smooth surface. Bake cake until a tester inserted into the center comes out clean and cake springs back slightly when pressed, 40\u201350 minutes. Let cool at least 20 minutes in pan, then turn out cake onto a platter and let cool completely.Step 4Do Ahead: Cake can be made 1 day ahead. Let cool, then cover with plastic wrap. Store at room temperature.Salted Toffee Sauce and AssemblyStep 5Melt brown sugar and butter in a small saucepan over medium-low heat, whisking constantly, until mixture is thick and smooth and brown sugar is dissolved, 4\u20136 minutes. Remove pot from heat and whisk in vanilla, \u00be cup sour cream, and 1\u00bd tsp. sea salt until smooth.Step 6Arrange torn dates in a ring on top of cake. Drizzle \u00bd cup sauce over cake and dates. Sprinkle with more sea salt. Serve cake with sour cream and remaining toffee sauce alongside. If the sauce has cooled and tightened up, gently reheat in saucepan over medium-low just until warm.Photo by Chelsie Craig, Food Styling by Pearl JonesHow would you rate Sticky Toffee Date Cake?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (7)Back to TopTriangleVery tasty-- just not quite the same as the original. I found the sour cream in the sauce overkill, so the next time I made this recipe, I replaced it with cream instead for a more traditional caramel sauce. Overall very happy with the finished result!AnonymousTallinn, Estonia1/22/2022AMAZING! Honestly one of the best cakes I've ever made. It's dense, with a tight crumb. and I love that the only sugar in it is brown sugar and the natural sweetness of the dates. I didn't have any sour cream, so i substituted it with yogurt for the cake and cream for the caramel. still came out great. Its definitely on my best cakes list!AlissaGuatemala12/13/2021I fudged up.\nWe don\u2019t have \u201csticks\u201d of butter in Australia. So when I googled what one stick was equivalent to, that\u2019s what I cut and put in the cake mix - not two. Raaaahhhhhh, oops. \nIt still turned out fine. I\u2019m going to drizzle a little bit of liqueur on it just in case it\u2019s a little dry. It smells divine!AnonymousAustralia12/29/2019Oops, to follow up on the previous reviewer: I used Greek yogurt thinned with a little oat milk and KAF GF 1:1 AP with great success.\n\nI second that this cake was surprisingly light and fluffy! Great texture to make it a true cake as opposed to the traditional pudding. AnonymousCambridge, MA12/20/2019Super delicious! The sauce is, as with any sticky toffee pudding, what makes it (it\u2019s basically liquid crack\u2014salty, sweet, rich...you just can\u2019t stop), Next time I might use a more diverse blend of spices in the cake itself to enhance the flavor. Served it to a few dinner guests, one of whom promptly said it was his favorite treat ever. High praise.AnonymousCambridge, MA12/20/2019This cake was the showstopper at brunch today. So easy to make. The batter was incredibly fIuffy and baked into a surprisingly delicate cake. I made it gluten free using 1-1/2 cup Bob\u2019s Red Mill 1-to-1 All Purpose Flour (naming the brand since each brand\u2019s gf flour behaves a little different) and superfine almond flour and dairy-free using Tofutti sour cream (again each brand is different, so naming my brand). Made no difference in taste for my glutenful and dairyful friends. \nMolly, you keep hitting it out of the park!digimikeyHouston, TX4/29/2019before i read the recipe i assumed that was pieces of bacon on top...an alternative topping that would be good.Anonymousbarcelona3/6/2019Explore Bon App\u00e9titCakeDessertDateDried FruitFruitNut-FreeBakingChristmasRecipes you want to make.
