Serve with a simple naan-like grilled flatbread, which can be made gluten-free with millet flour if you prefer\u2014but cook them in a skillet instead as they will be more delicate to handle. \u2014Rachel GurjarAll products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

We complained about the recipe being overly fussy for a weeknight the whole time (second yogurt sauce was debatably necessary) \u2026 all that being said \u2026 SO very delicious. AnonymousNew Orleans, LA 9/23/2021Has anyone tried making the marinated mushrooms ahead of time and letting them chill overnight before cooking? Would that work well, or is it necessary to assemble and cook on the same day?Overnight Shrooms?7/28/2021Would this recipe still work using vegan unsweetened yogurt both for the mushrooms and flatbread?  Thanks!Alyssa MBay Area7/27/2021Absolutely delicious. The recipe is a little confusing. The yogurt sauce is prepared and kept for serving. Then you make a different yogurt marinade for the mushrooms. That said, this is great recipe and worth the timeAnonymousAtlanta, GA7/25/2021Explore Bon App\u00e9titFlatbreadBreadMaitake MushroomMushroomVegetableWhole Wheat FlourFlourCrimini MushroomMainNut-FreeVegetarianGrillingDinnerRecipes you want to make.
