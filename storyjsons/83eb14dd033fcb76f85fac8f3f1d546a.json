I made this exactly as the recipe was written, and WOW. My Dad and I ate the whole thing, and he's 96! I would only say to dress it lightly,  so you don't lose the fresh tomato and peach flavors, with the dressing taking backstage but not by much. Which left me with enough dressing for another one this week! Mary KayPrairie Village, KS8/16/2021This is amazing. I used half Sriracha and half Jamaican hot sauce. Tore up fresh mozzarella into bits, and added some fresh basil with my fresh tarragon from the garden. This is my new taste of summer. Absolutely delicious!Barbara ZWashington, DC8/11/2021Great salad and great way to use up the bumper crop of tomatoes I have this year--I could eat this every day. I had halloumi on hand so I fried and used that instead of mozz or burrata, and I think it came out just as nicely. A hit.AnonymousBurlington, VT8/19/2020OH ME OH MY!!!  This is so yummy!  It\u2019s the 2nd of 3 BA peach recipes I\u2019ve made today that I have put in my calendar to have again next summer.  Not sure I will wait that long!AnonymousAlbuquerque NM8/16/2020this salad was FIRE. The dressing was so creative and amazing, and everything was perfectly balanced. Will definitely be making this again!AnonymousSouth Carolina8/3/2020Love this easy, delicious salad. I went into it cautiously optimistic and was blown away. The sweet and savory flavor combo is AMAZING!!! AnonymousPortland, OR8/12/2019Loved the recipe! As one of the reviewers before, added also melon and used tabasco. In Germany have not yet found burrata in the supermarket, so used just a nice fresh mozzarella, not as creamy but also good. AnonymousHannover, Germany10/14/2018I really, really, really enjoyed this ridiculously easy salad. It is a crowd pleaser, too and even by a 3 and 1 year old. Good flavor, not spicy at all.Buffalo, NY9/4/2018It would never have occurred to me to make a salad like this one but I loved it.  If you have leftovers, it wilts/softens a bit the next day but the flavors are even better...had some leftover rice and laid this over the top of it for a better desk lunch than most have.  :)AnonymousHouston8/19/2018This is hands down the best late summer salad I\u2019ve ever made. I made it for a dinner party and it was completely gone by the end of the night. Here are some substitutions I made because I didn\u2019t have all the ingredients on hand and it still tasted delicious.\n2 tsp rice vinegar -> 2 tsp white vinegar + 1/2 tsp sugar\n2 Tbs mild hot sauce -> 18 drops of original Tobasco\nThought I\u2019d share just in case someone ends up in the same situation.AnonymousSalt Lake City8/16/2018This is ridiculously delicious! Yes! cookndc8/9/2018yum.\nAnonymousAtlanta8/8/2018This recipe is perfect as is!! I wouldn\u2019t change a thing. It is Delicious and a show stopper. Everyone loved it. We had some leftover watermelon and added it to the left-overs the next day which was delicious too.AnonymousAR8/5/2018This salad is sensational.  It has wonderful flavor, looks and tastes great.  I used Gochugang hot sauce , as well as using fresh basil leaves instead of tarragon.  Fantastic.  It also kept well overnight and was delicious the second day. It's a keeper and a repeater.AnonymousLA8/3/2018Made it for company and it was a big hit. I used small hierloom tomatoes with wonderfully ripe (but not overly ripe) peaches.
