We\u2019re in crisis times here. We\u2019ve become a nation of blithering blue-lit automatons who can barely peel our eyeballs off our shiny screen objects to acknowledge another human person within our breathing space.Dinnertime\u2014you know, the ritual of human-to-human bonding since time immemorial\u2014has warped into an American tableau of disfunction and disconnection, with entire families tinkering on their phones instead of engaging with the people right there in front of them. And the same goes for friend dates.We\u2019ve all been there. You\u2019ve gone back and forth and back and forth to set a date. You get to the restaurant, sit down, and your friend asks you a question about LIFE. But before you can get halfway through your first sentence, she\u2019s checking her phone for extremely urgent updates such as a new like on the 5746th Instagram of her pug. Or maybe you are that friend, texting and tweeting while an array of small plates go cold. We\u2019ve all been there too.We clearly need help with this phones-at-dinner thing. So, I called up manners experts Amy Alkon, whose most recent book is Unf*ckology: A Field Guide to Living with Guts and Confidence, and Nancy Mitchell, author of Etiquette Rules! A Field Guide to Modern Manners. Here are the new rules for dinner etiquette in the age of smartphones.The First Step is Admitting You Have a Problem\u201cOur phones are designed to be electronic drugs,\u201d says Alkon, whose advice stems from evidence-based social science. \u201cThey trigger an intermittent reinforcement response.\u201d According to Alkon, in a study with rats and cocaine, the rats that reliably got cocaine every time they pressed on a lever, stopped pressing the lever, while rats that only got cocaine intermittently would press the lever all the time. When we get the occasional Instagram like or Twitter retweet, that\u2019s intermittent reinforcement and it makes us want to check our phones all the time. So, your first step is admitting that you\u2014like a rat with an unreliable cocaine lever \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u2014are addicted to dumb social-media feedback.These waffles need your respect. Put the phone down!\nBrian FinkeStart with a Plan, ManIt\u2019s hard to wing fighting off temptation in the moment, especially later in the day when our will power is depleted. \u201cThink ahead of time how to minimize the use of your phone,\u201d says Mitchell. \u201cTake the calls you need to take, visit the websites, and send the texts before you get to the restaurant.\u201d If there is some rare reason for which you can\u2019t wait a full hour or two to check your phone, then do it on your way to the bathroom or let your friends know the pressing reason and do it quickly after finishing your mains.Out of Sight, Out of Mind\u201cPutting your phone on the table advertises that the virtual world is more interesting than the people at the table,\u201d says Mitchell. If you put your phone in a bag or a jacket pocket, you won\u2019t automatically reach for it anytime it buzzes, flashes, or rings. Alkon puts her phone on airplane mode anytime she goes out to dinner. Unless you\u2019re a cardiac surgeon or fireman, which, let\u2019s be real, most of us aren\u2019t, yours should be on silent at least. And if you\u2019re a parent, who needs it near \u201cjust in case!,\u201d then turn off all the notifications for your apps\u2014the latest Twitter alert isn\u2019t an update from your babysitter and shouldn\u2019t be treated as one.Dudes, your faces are glowing.\nAlex LauDon\u2019t Kill the Vibe\u201cThese restaurants work very hard to set up an environment,\u201d Alkon notes. \u201cDon\u2019t give someone epilepsy with repeated flashes.\u201d This is an important point, for camera flashes as well as general screen brightness. The other night, I was waiting in a packed entryway of a busy restaurant getting partially blinded by some guy\u2019s phone with the brightness cranked up to burning-surface-of-the-sun levels. What was this man\u2019s vital reason for exposing half the restaurant to this obnoxious glare? He was writing a comment on Facebook. Remember, when you\u2019re in a dark, ambient restaurant checking your phone, everyone else around you is forced to check it too.Be in the Now, My Dudes\u201cAll these people are talking about mindfulness meditation, but you don\u2019t have to lay on the floor for an hour,\u201d says Alkon. \u201cWe can choose to have lives that are connected and engaged and in the moment.\u201d That means paying attention to what people at the table are saying instead of mouthing \u201cjust one minute\u201d while you check your phone for the zillionth time. \u201cIt\u2019s mean and unkind,\u201d says Alkon, to make your friends feel ignored.Take the photo of your porridge at Sqirl\u2014then put it away!\nMichael Graydon & Nikole HerriottBut What About Food Photos?Right about now, many of you might be asking, but what about Instagramming? Isn\u2019t that what we all do? Sure, take your phone out when a dish comes around, take your photo, and then put it away. You can edit and post it in the Uber ride home. Done and done. You don\u2019t need to tweet, text, or compulsively check your phone through the meal to see how many likes you\u2019ve racked up. And it also doesn\u2019t hurt, once in awhile, to go completely Instagram-free for a meal and enjoy your damn food while it\u2019s still hot.And Hey, Meet a Stranger, They Don\u2019t Bite\u201cWe\u2019ve cut ourselves off from spontaneous encounters,\u201d says Mitchell. \u201cPeople are losing the ability to make small talk and basic communication skills are suffering.\u201d It used to be that people would talk to strangers at the bar or in line, but now many people are too busy swiping left and right on virtual potential that they\u2019re missing the real-world opportunities right in front of them. It\u2019s still possible!We\u2019re pretty sure she\u2019s telling him to put the phone down here.\nAlex LauWhat About Your Friends?Okay, so what if you have perfect phone habits, while your unwashed friends turn group dinners into silent retreats back into the virtual reality cult. There are a few different approaches to take. You can go with the \u2018ol \u201cphones stacking\u201d challenge, in which everyone puts their phone in a neat little pile on the table and the first person to reach for his or hers has to pay the bill. You can also try, as Mitchell suggests, to broach the subject before sitting down by telling everyone that you\u2019re going phone-free for the meal and would appreciate if they\u2019d do the same. This also goes for dinner parties: Be the change you want to see in the world and announce that you, a hero, are leaving your phone in your coat pocket.How to Handle That One Friend Perpetually Glued to the ScreenAnd what about that one friend who is always scrolling Instagram and tweeting observations about life\u2019s hilarious little quirks as if a Seinfeld-like break depends on it? Whatever you do, don\u2019t shame someone in the moment. Alkon says this triggers the same chemical response as fight or flight mode and people can get defensive. Instead take your friends aside at another time and let them know about how you feel when they\u2019re staring at their always-available electronic devices instead of making the most of your QT together.The TakeawayWhat this all comes down to is being mindful of your phone use. \u201cThe basics of etiquette is thinking about how your behavior impacts other people,\u201d says Mitchell. And it\u2019s also thinking about how your phone compulsion affects you. At the end of the day, no one gives awards speeches or death-bed farewells about their social-media followers, so let\u2019s keep it that way. Put your damn phone down and just eat with your real-world friends. Your notifications about your pug Instagrams and incredibly on-point Twitter gifs will be waiting for you when you\u2019re done.For your next (phones-free) dinner party:Explore Bon App\u00e9titRestaurants + TravelInstagramPhotographyRecipes you want to make.
