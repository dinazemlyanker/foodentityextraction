Much of that time has been spent making this guac.By Neil Patrick Harris and David BurtkaOctober 30, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailFacebookTwitterEmailIn honor of Ina Garten's guest editing week, we asked chefs and celebrity fans to share their favorite Barefoot Contessa recipes as part of our series \u201cHow Easy Is That?.\u201d Below, a conversation between actor Neil Patrick Harris and his husband, David Burtka (chef and author of upcoming cookbook Life Is a Party), about why they love Ina\u2019s guacamole recipe\u2014and how it won them a competition at Survivor host Jeff Probst\u2019s house.\u00a0\n\u00a0Neil Patrick Harris: I am from Albuquerque, New Mexico, so Mexican food is deep within my familial heritage. Chips and salsa, guacamole, and nachos are sort of like a thumb-in-my-mouth, blanket-wrapped-around-me comfort food. And I have strong opinions about it. So once David and I started dating, he quickly realized that it needed to be a household staple. We tried all kinds of guacamole recipes, and the one we took a shine to was Ina Garten\u2019s, which seems so abnormal. It didn\u2019t seem like it fit based on where she\u2019s from. But her appreciation of the simplicity of it, I think, makes it a really terrific recipe. We\u2019ve had really good luck with it.David Burtka: We make a lot of Ina\u2019s recipes, like her coconut muffins, Mediterranean orzo salad, and tomato soup, but we make the guacamole recipe more than any other. The one thing that sets it apart from others, and makes it the real winner, is that she uses lemon and not lime. It gives it that zip. There\u2019s something about the sour mixed with the fat and the salt that just makes it a home run. It\u2019s just kind of a perfect recipe. The other reason I think this recipe is so good is because there\u2019s no cilantro! Cilantro is so polarizing for people. Either people love it or they hate it. You can always add it later, but this is a good base to make sure everyone is happy.Harris: Also, guacamole should not be overly mixed in my opinion. Like with a good pico de gallo, it\u2019s best when it\u2019s chunky and you can appreciate the individual tastes as well as how they come together. I love what Ina suggests: cutting the avocados in half, coring them, scooping into a bowl, and then using a knife and just cutting them almost like a chessboard. You dice them inside the bowl while turning the bowl 90\u00b0, and then repeating, so you don\u2019t have to mash them. They turn into small little pieces which match the size of the tomato that you diced as well, and you wind up with this really fresh taste and appearance.Harris: One night, we went to Jeff Probst\u2019s house\u2014of Survivor fame\u2014and he was having a proper game night. One of the games was a guacamole-off and everyone brought their different versions of guac. We won with Ina\u2019s recipe. Everyone wanted to know what our secret was!Burtka: We brought it in one of those old Molcajetes with homemade chips. I don\u2019t like to do the triangles\u2014I do them in strips so you get a long piece that curls up really nicely. If we buy store-bought chips, we get a mix of different colors: blue corn, yellow, and white. It mixes up the colors and textures and is pretty on the plate.Harris: You know what else I made for David? When we first started dating, I tried to impress him with my chile con queso recipe at a Superbowl party. The recipe was so easy and great: equal parts Velveeta Mexican cheese and Pace Picante sauce, medium. You cube up the Velveeta, dump in the sauce, and microwave it in 30-second increments. It\u2019s a little bit of a gut rot, but it\u2019s really delicious. I think David was offended that I thought that was an actual recipe, and that\u2019s when he said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we move towards guacamole, where you actually have some work to do?\u201d And then we found Ina\u2019s recipe. So we owe our relationship to her. Thanks, Ina.\u00a0Ina Garten\u2019s GuacamoleFrom The Barefoot Contessa CookbookMakes 3 cupsWe use a knife to chop the avocados, which makes a chunky dip. It is very important to use Haas avocados from California. They\u2019re not the pretty green ones you see in the market, but the earthy brown ones. They are ripe when they just give to the touch. I am not a cilantro fan, so add it if you love it. Serve at room temperature with yellow or blue corn chips.A customer once asked us, \u201cHow do you get the guacamole green?\u201d Of course we wondered what color it should be, but I think she wanted to know how we got it so green. We keep it green by storing it with plastic wrap pressed directly on top. Air will turn it brown, so the less air contact, the better. I believe it\u2019s only a myth that an avocado pit will keep the guacamole green. Lemon juice does the best job.4 ripe Haas avocados3 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice (1 lemon)8 dashes Tabasco sauce\u00bd cup small-diced red onion (1 small onion)1 large garlic clove, minced1 teaspoon kosher salt1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper1 medium tomato, seeded, and small-dicedCut the avocados in half, remove the pits, and scoop the flesh out of their shells into a large bowl. (I use my hands.)Immediately add the lemon juice, Tabasco, onion, garlic, salt, and pepper and toss well. Using a sharp knife, slice through the avocados in the bowl until they are finely diced. Add the tomatoes. Mix well and taste for salt and pepper.Recipe reprinted from The Barefoot Contessa Cookbook. Copyright \u00a9 1999 by Ina Garten.
