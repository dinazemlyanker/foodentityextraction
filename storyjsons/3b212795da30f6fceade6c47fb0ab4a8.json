Pro tip: If you sign up for the newsletter, you'll get the scoop before everyone else.Healthyish friends,I've been off the boat for nearly a week, and people are still asking if I have my \"land legs back.\" I tell them I was on a ship the size of a small country so I never really lost them. Back at the office, we're churning out some pretty stellar Healthyish holiday recipes and plotting the Feel Good Food Plan for early next year. No spoilers, but it's gonna be DELICIOUS. Here's what else is going on:This Week on HealthyishOn Monday we published a little story from Molly Guinn Bradley about trying the keto diet and a gallery of keto-friendly recipes to match. You guys were...extremely interested. Personally even the thought of such a restrictive diet makes me panic and seek bread, but I get the impulse to read about extreme ways of eating. Just know that Marion Nestle, our favorite no-B.S. nutrition goddess, would never mess with keto.Make It TonightOn Sunday, after a stressful, chore-and-work-heavy weekend, I threw together a version of these Healthyish sweet potato bowls, roasting the sweet potatoes instead of steaming them, and saute\u00e9ing the fennel and onion in ghee instead of leaving it raw. I cooked the ground lamb with this ras el hanout from SOS Chefs that I love, and more ghee, until it was extra crispy. I layered the lemony yogurt sauce over the hot sweet potatoes, followed by the lamb, and finally the cooked fennel with fennel fronds on top. It took barely any time at all, and it was the comfort food I needed. Hashtag sweetpotatoseason, ya feel me?Influence ThisI love voting not just because it's a right and a privilege but because my polling place is at a retirement home and I love a good senior-citizen chit chat like nothing else. I'm happy that we're all reminding each other to vote on Election Day (Nov. 6, set that alert!), but PSA that showing up at your polling place without knowing what's on your ballot is like showing up for the final without cracking a book. There are probably more races and measures than you realize on your ballot, so head to a site like Ballotpedia or BallotReady to see exactly what you'll see on Nov. 6. (That's next Tuesday, people.) Then do your research!Until next week,Amanda ShapiroHealthyish EditorExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishHealthyish NewsletteressayRead MoreLifestyleNote from a BoatBy Amanda ShapiroRecipes you want to make.
