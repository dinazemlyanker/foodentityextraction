Next, the dairy-free ice cream. Now cashews have entered the yogurt game, dominating all-day cafe menus (find it at L.A. mainstay Honey Hi and abcV in NYC) and the ever-expanding shelves of the dairy aisle (see brands like Forager, Vega, and Blode Kuh).Making regular dairy-based yogurt can feel intense (So many live cultures! So little time!), but it turns out that making nut-based yogurt is almost as easy as blending up a morning smoothie. And the payoff is huge: smooth, silky yogurt that\u2019s definitely cheaper than the store-bought stuff.\u201cYogurt is the one dairy product I consume a good amount of, so I kind of scoffed at the idea of making this recipe,\u201d says senior food editor (and noted yogurt lover)  Andy Baraghani. \u201cBut it\u2019s really easy to achieve.\u201dWe could get lost in these swirls.\nPhoto by Alex LauStart by soaking a cup of raw cashews overnight to help the nuts soften and break down easily. In the morning, drain and toss them in a blender with some kosher salt, lemon juice, and honey. The lemon juice helps mimic dairy\u2019s distinctive tang, plus it plays off the honey to balance the flavors in the bowl. Get the motor running and stream in \u00bd\u2013\u2154 cup water until the mixture is smooth and has your desired, yogurt-like consistency. It's smart to start with \u00bd cup water and add more as needed, because soft cashews will absorb more water the longer they soak.Once the blended mixture looks like, well, yogurt, transfer it to a medium bowl. It'll keep in the fridge for up to a week\u2014perfect for mornings when you barely have time to get dressed, let alone make breakfast.Because the yogurt-making process is so simple, now is the time to really go wild with your toppings. For this recipe, Baraghani macerated some cherries with lemon juice and sugar, using a food stylist\u2019s trick to really amp up the all-day cafe look. \u201cI like to pop the pits out with my thumbs to create a craggy effect,\" he says. \"It's so much more interesting than a clean cut.\" Try this technique on sugar plums or tiny apricots, or just use berries instead.Next, add some texture with toasted coconut, chopped nuts, a drizzle of honey, or some grain-free tahini granola. You can even swirl in some jam if you \"accidentally\" ate all the farmers' market fruit you were saving for breakfast. Serve it up in a good ceramic bowl, find some natural light, and boom\u2014your kitchen just became the hottest breakfast spot in town. Bonus: you can absolutely eat there in your PJs.It's easier than you thought:Cashew YogurtThink of this creamy cashew yogurt as a new, flavorful vessel for your granola or fruit in the morning.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishCashewYogurtBreakfastRead MorecookingThese Onion-y Turmeric Eggs Are the Perfect Breakfast Comfort FoodBy Andy BaraghaniRecipes you want to make.
