So we dreamed up a solution: a cake that\u2019s equal parts crumb and cake. The topping gets extra pizzazz from crushed gingersnaps and fresh ginger that balance all that buttery goodness. Also, no need to whip out the fancy stand mixer\u2014both the topping and batter come together in a food processor. Whoever said you can\u2019t have your cake and eat it too?Ingredients10\u201312 servingsCrumb Topping2cups gingersnaps (any brand; about 5 oz.)3cups all-purpose flour1\u00becups (packed) dark brown sugar1Tbsp. ground cinnamon1\u00bctsp. kosher salt1\u00bccups (2\u00bd sticks) plus 2 Tbsp. melted unsalted butter2Tbsp. finely grated fresh ginger (from one 3\" piece)Cake and Assembly10Tbsp. unsalted butter, room temperature, plus more for pan2\u2153cups all-purpose flour1\u2153cups granulated sugar2tsp. baking powder1tsp. kosher salt\u00bdtsp. baking soda2large eggs\u2154cup sour cream1Tbsp. vanilla extractPreparationCrumb ToppingStep 1Process gingersnaps in a food processor until fine crumbs form. Add flour, brown sugar, cinnamon, and salt and pulse until combined. Transfer flour mixture to a large bowl and gradually drizzle in melted butter, mixing until large sandy clumps form and no dry spots remain. Add ginger and mix just to combine. Set crumb topping aside until ready to use. Wipe out food processor bowl (no need to wash it; you\u2019ll use it for the cake).Cake and AssemblyStep 2Preheat oven to 350\u00b0. Lightly grease a 13x9\" pan with butter, then line with parchment, leaving an overhang on both long sides; butter parchment. Pulse flour, granulated sugar, baking powder, salt, and baking soda in food processor until combined. Add 10 Tbsp. butter and pulse until mixture is sandy. Add eggs, sour cream, and vanilla and pulse continuously until mixture is very smooth and homogenous, about 2 minutes. Scrape down sides and pulse once more.Step 3Spread batter in prepared pan. Scatter crumb topping over, squeezing small handfuls with your palms to create some larger crumbs and slightly favoring the outside 2\" around the perimeter.Step 4Bake cake until crumb is golden brown and a tester inserted into the center comes out clean, 40\u201350 minutes. Let cool.Step 5Run a thin knife around edge of pan to help release cake. Lift parchment up and transfer cake to a cutting board or platter; discard parchment. Cut cake into squares.Photo by Emma Fishman, Food styling by Pearl Jones, prop styling by Allie WistHow would you rate Double-Crumb Crumb Cake?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (12)Back to TopTriangleDelicious! Always wanted to bake a crumb cake and I love the ratio of crumb to cake! However the only change I made was reduced cinnamon to 1tsp as I thought 1 Tbsp sounded like ALOT. you could still taste the cinnamon without it being over powering. I also  only had less than 1/3 cup of sour cream left so I substituted plain low fat yogurt.  \nAlso added some fresh blueberries to the batter (about a cup). \nThe cake was an excellent dessert when served warm with custard and/ ice cream and even better the next day with coffee.  \nI\u2019ve written down the recipe just in case BA removes it from their website one day I love it that much! Rita DNew Jersey 4/25/2021I\u2019ve never been able to bake anything more complicated then brownies from a mix in a box, or something equally simple like Nestle Cookies. I decided to try this recipe in an attempt to make something a bit more complicated and from scratch. And it came out great! It was difficult a bit to do this without a food processor, but I managed to use my blender pretty effectively. And I took some to other friends in quarantine and they all loved it. Can\u2019t wait to bring this to a party someday. And now - I feel ready to bake other, more complicated things as well.arincon1991New York City 5/21/2020excellent cake! can eat it for dessert...or even breakfast. love the spice that the ground ginger and the gingersnaps add! vanilla ice cream is an excellent accompaniment.AnonymousChicago, IL4/26/2020YUM so good. The flavor of the cake itself was amazing and of course the crumb portion was spot on. A super fun dessert/snack that was devoured v quickly abbygauenChicago4/7/2020This recipe was a little finicky, but I'm not much of a baker anyways. I liked the idea of the double crumb layer in proportion to the cake, but I think it makes the baking process a bit more difficult. I noticed that the cake did not cook super evenly throughout, and I actually had the opposite problem to other posters saying 40 minutes was too long; mine needed longer in the oven to bake through, so again, I think it's down to inconsistency with the crumb coating preventing even baking. Other than the baking though, I thought it came together fairly easily and I enjoyed the flavors. It's not something I'd make often simply due to the large quantity of butter in the recipe, but it was great to bring into work as a treat for everyone. AnonymousCleveland, Ohio3/3/2020Molly Baz does it again! This cake is A1. The ratio of crumb to cake is insanely perfect. All crumb cakes must be make with this ratio from this point forward.Mia LaVadaUpstate NY1/27/2020Don't have that size pan..can I use 9\"  springform pan, and how does it change cooking time????hunyejohn12/17/2019My girlfriend and I made this cake with a NutriBullet as we don't have a processor just yet. Took a bit longer but wow was it worth it. \n\nThis cake is so delicious and we had some for nearly a week - between both of our families. 3 beautiful layers came out just like the picture here shows. \nThe crumbs were beautifully flavoured and not dry at all. The inner cake was so moist and delicious as well. And lets not forget the beautiful crust all round the edge and on the bottom. \n\nBaking time was fine at just about 35mins and allowing to rest for 5minutes.\n\nWill certainly bake this again and bring it to the family xmas party.\n\nI have to say, for a couple of young adults who are certainly amateurs at cooking, this recipe was extremely easy to follow. For the other people here who reviewed this recipe with a low star rating, perhaps you should read more carefully :) FletcherRobboAustralia12/7/2019baked for 40 minutes and the whole thing was overly dry--cake and topping. So disappointing! I agree with another commenter that perhaps 40 mins is too long?AnonymousNYC12/2/2019Whomever created this recipe deserves a big Christmas bonus! The flavors are excellent in this cake and it is so easy to make in the food processor. I used Ivins spiced wafers and Plugra butter and cooked the cake for maximum 40 minutes. I'm a bit unsure on the cooking time since my oven malfunctioned by locking itself after 30 minutes at which point I turned it off while trying to get the door opened (a coat hanger forcing the latch did the trick!). The moistness of the cake and the fresh ginger zing in the crumb was perfect.  Everyone loved this cake and two of the 'everyones' aren't big cake eaters at all.  Nice, nice dessert!AnonymousNew London, PA12/2/2019This is such a delicious cake. Spot on with the 50/50 ratio. I found I needed to bake it a bit longer, but the flavour and easy recipe was perfect!Mr_JuliaChildMelbourne, Australia11/24/2019I would make the cake again, but not the same way. The crumble turned out kinda dry and sandy, even with all the butter in it. The dough of the cake itself was very though. Maybe 40 minutes was too long?\nWith yogourt and loads of blueberry its alright.AnonymousMontr\u00e9al11/23/2019Explore Bon App\u00e9titCakeDessertGingerHerbs & SpicesCinnamonEasySnackNut-FreeBakingBreakfastRecipes you want to make.
