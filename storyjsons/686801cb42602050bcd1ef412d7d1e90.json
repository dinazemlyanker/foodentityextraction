Here are three to try.By Hilary CadiganJuly 27, 2021FacebookTwitterEmailPhotograph by Yudi Ela, food styling by Susie Theodorou, prop styling by Aneta FlorczykFacebookTwitterEmailIf the idea of cheese cooked over an open fire sounds bizarre, I get it. It used to sound that way to me too. In my house growing up, grilled cheese meant two pieces of soggy whole wheat bread spread with margarine, stuffed with a piece of individually wrapped American cheese or two, and heated until melty (but not particularly crispy or delicious) in a nonstick skillet over the kitchen stove. (Sometimes we\u2019d add a slice of tomato if we really wanted it to get extra soggy. These were not great sandwiches.)But personal tragedies aside, what we\u2019re talking about here is cheese on the grill. As in, the grill you may or may not have in your yard right now, waiting patiently for its next round of hot dogs. And what we\u2019re not talking about is American singles, or cheddar, Swiss, or Gouda. A good grilling cheese, you see, is one that will char when cooked but not ooze through the grate to oblivion. And if you\u2019re vegetarian but not vegan, it can act as an appropriately indulgent alternative to meat at your next summer cookout.So I called up my very smart colleague, associate food editor Rachel Gurjar, for the lowdown. \u201cGrillable cheeses have a high melting point,\u201d she tells me. \u201cThey\u2019ll get perfectly charred and smoky on the outside, while staying nice and creamy on the inside, making them the perfect vehicle for all kinds of flavors.\u201d She suggests cooking these cheeses in slabs about 1\u00bd\u20132-inches thick on the medium-heat zone of the grill so they get warmed all the way through. About 3\u20134 minutes per side should do it. Here are three types to try.Paneer: This creamy nonaged Indian cheese is made from curdled cow\u2019s milk or buffalo\u2019s milk and doesn\u2019t melt, so it holds up quite well on the grill. Use it as a medium for all kinds of marinades, wet or dry, and pair it with crunchy grilled veggies (exhibit A: Rachel\u2019s Cheesy Charred Green Beans) for a very good side dish. Her favorite paneer brand is Sach, which she likes because it\u2019s ethically sourced and extra rich.Manouri: Feta\u2019s less salty little sister is literally a by-product of the more spotlight-hogging Greek cheese: It\u2019s made from feta whey. Manouri has a smooth and silky texture but keeps its form when grilled, making it the perfect topper for summer salads. Or, for an extremely addictive appetizer, drizzle it with honey and serve it with seedy crackers, stone fruit, or a crusty slice of bread.Halloumi: Salty, semihard, and unripened, Cyprus\u2019s most famous dairy export is made with a mix of goat\u2019s milk and sheep\u2019s milk, and its high melting point means no mess\u2014just salty, creamy, chewy goodness. Try it on a toasted bun dressed up with your favorite burger toppings, \u00e0 la this recipe for Seared Squash and Halloumi Burgers.Explore Bon App\u00e9tittechniquecookingRecipes you want to make.
