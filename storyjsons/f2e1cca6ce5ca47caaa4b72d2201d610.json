Step 1: Buy a great steak from a great butcher. Step 2: Salt it liberally. Step 3: Gradually build up a crusty sear. Step 4: Butter. Butter?! Yep\u2014butter. Browned, nutty butter will deliver toasty flavor to every bite. It\u2019s the secret to pretty much all the great steakhouse dinners you\u2019ve ever had.Ingredients2 servings11\u00be\"-thick bone-in rib eye (about 1\u00bd lb.)Kosher salt, freshly ground pepper2tsp. vegetable oil3Tbsp. unsalted butter2sprigs rosemary2garlic cloves, crushedFlaky sea saltPreparationStep 1Season steak generously with kosher salt and pepper and let sit at room temperature 1 hour.Step 2Heat a dry large skillet, preferably cast iron, over medium-high, then add oil. As soon as oil is smoking, cook steak, turning every 2 minutes or so, until a deep brown crust forms and the internal temperature is a few degrees below your favored doneness (120\u00b0\u2013125\u00b0 for medium-rare), 8\u201310 minutes.Step 3Add butter, rosemary, and garlic to skillet, tilt pan toward you so that butter pools on one side, and use a large spoon to continually baste steak with butter. Continue until butter is no longer bubbling and it smells nutty and is beginning to brown, about 1 minute. Transfer meat to a cutting board and let rest 10 minutes. (For medium-rare, your steak should reach an internal temperature of 125\u00b0\u2013130\u00b0.)Step 4Cut meat from bone and slice against the grain 1\" thick. Spoon some infused brown butter over steak and sprinkle with sea salt.Read More: The 29 New Essential Recipes from the Bon App\u00e9tit Test KitchenHow would you rate Brown Butter\u2013Basted Steak?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (5)Back to TopTrianglePerfect way to get restaurant-quality steak!
