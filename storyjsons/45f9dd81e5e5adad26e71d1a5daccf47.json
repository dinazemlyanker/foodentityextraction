Three years and a lot of setbacks later, Simone, a produce-driven restaurant in the Arts District, will begin service on September 20th. We can\u2019t wait to snag a reservation, but, in the meantime, we asked Largey to fill us in on how she\u2019s found sanity outside the kitchen these last few years, and how she\u2019s prioritizing mental health for both herself and her kitchen staff at Simone.I didn\u2019t cook professionally for three years, which made me feel crazy. But I had a lot of time to think about my time at Manresa, how I was so burned out and overworked. I was 25 and winning awards, and people were telling me that I had a dream job while I didn't even know how to get through Wednesday. I went from a very confident line cook to the most insecure chef de cuisine of all time, and I think a lot of my struggle and depression there came from not having someone to look up to in the kitchen. I didn\u2019t know how to be myself and also have a creative voice. All these people were looking to me for answers, and I felt like I had to always be right.\nOver the last three years, I\u2019ve gotten to a place where I can say, \u201cI don\u2019t know. Let\u2019s figure it out together.\u201d That\u2019s been huge.While we were getting Simone off the ground, I really wanted to work; I wanted to be creating. But it was also nice to have time to go out to other restaurants, to cook at home, and just learn how I liked to eat. I found myself cooking a lot less meat. There was intention behind that, to eat more plant-based food, but it was also what I was craving.Cooking for one person is really hard in general, but it\u2019s especially hard for a chef. I was always begging my friends to stay for dinner because I had so much food. I\u2019d go to the store or the farmers\u2019 market, grab a bunch of stuff that looked great, and see what happened. I ended up turning some of these off-the-cuff creations into dishes at Simone. Yes, there\u2019s a grain bowl on the menu!I also fell in love with being a morning person. I was waking up at 6 or 7 a.m. without an alarm, and I\u2019m still doing that even though my hours at the restaurant have ramped up. Being up early feels like one of the best things I can do...for me but also for my relationship with my partner. It\u2019s a secret time. There\u2019s no expectation of communication; you get to hide and not be attached to your devices.I have little rituals, like making my Chemex coffee and devoting all my attention to it for those five minutes. Or taking a walk. When I moved to LA two and a half years ago, I took a lot of care getting to know my neighborhood on foot. Being able to walk in this city brings me a lot of joy. I can walk to Elysian Park; the LA River path is right by me. I can ride my bike for ten miles from right outside my door. I walk to Cookbook in Echo Park and a million amazing coffee shops. Getting to Simone only takes 45 minutes on foot. Even a short walk can change your day.I\u2019ve spent the last three years working on myself, and I\u2019m so happy to be putting all that into practice and working with other people. I want to teach my chefs and cooks that they don\u2019t have to do it the way I did it. They can be who they are at work, and they can have a life outside of it.There are a lot of people in the kitchen at Simone. I\u2019ve never worked with any of them before, and that was intentional. I tried to let go of my workaholic habits, all the pressure I put on myself, and wipe the slate clean. It\u2019s been empowering.I try to not have gender be a part of my mindset, but it is a big issue in this industry. I was leading my cooks around the farmers\u2019 market one day, and someone jokingly said to another one, \u201cWe lost mom.\u201d I said to them, \u201cIf I were a male chef, you\u2019d never call me \u2018Dad.\u2019\u201d  Another time, I noticed a cook say to another cook, \u201cladies first.\u201d I had a talk with my whole staff after that, and I told them, \u201cWe need to be aware of the fact that all these little things perpetuate a gender imbalance in this industry.\u201d I tell my servers to pull out the chairs for everyone; not just the women. I tell my cooks never to assume that a woman will be okay with a smaller piece of meat than a man. As a manager, I like to be silly and have fun, but I can be very serious too. You can call me \u201cJess\u201d unless things are very intense. Then you can call me \u201cchef.\u201dAs told to Amanda Shapiro.
