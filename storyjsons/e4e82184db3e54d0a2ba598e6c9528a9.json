Pro tip: If you sign up for the newsletter, you'll get the scoop before everyone else.Healthyish friends,I like amari, the bitter, Italian after-dinner drinks, because they\u2019re basically wellness shots made with a bajillion good-for-you herbs. I was at Fausto recently, a very good restaurant that your parents will also love, and at the end of the meal our server gave us some Averna (that\u2019s a brand of amaro from 1969 that had been unearthed in an old gas station in Tuscany). I swear to you it smelled like gasoline\u2014to the point that one of my dining companions sat with his nose in the glass, in a fugue state, for about five minutes. We debated whether it was possible for an amaro to absorb the, um, terroir of a gas station, but then we stopped caring and just drank it.The 5-Star ReviewWhy not hex your ex this Valentine\u2019s Day? Salty, the feminist sex newsletter run by Claire Fitzsimmons, will send a card to your ex, letting them know they\u2019ve been mildly cursed. Then you can finally move along with your life, bake this chocolate cake (or this one) or this one), and share it with someone you love, even if that someone is you.What I\u2019m CookingPhoto by Gentl and Hyers, food styling by Susie Theodorou, prop styling by Nina LalliBon App\u00e9tit\u2019s March issue dropped yesterday, and I haven\u2019t earmarked this many recipes from a single magazine in a long time. I already made Carla Lalli Music\u2019s seared lamb with halloumi because those are two of my desert-island ingredients, and I can report that it was as good as it looks, even when you double the spices by mistake. This weekend I\u2019ll be going in on some red wine and soy\u2013braised short ribs from The Good Fork chef Sohui Kim, and I\u2019m eyeing this sesame-scallion sauce, which seems like a meal-prep dream come true.Now that Healthyish is more than two years old (!), I sometimes rediscover recipes that I totally forgot about. Like the time I asked Chris Morocco for a sheet-pan salmon recipe, and he delivered this perfect little number. The dish is so simple and super flavorful thanks to the miso mojo, made with an acidic triple-threat of orange juice, lime juice, and rice vinegar, plus a couple tablespoons of miso and thinly sliced serranos. I\u2019ve been using the leftovers as salad dressing all week.This Week on HealthyishMacKenzie Fagan heads to La Copine, the desert roadside diner of our dreams, to talk to the co-owners about the intentional community they\u2019ve built there. I ate at La Copine when I was in Joshua Tree last month, and it does indeed feel as utopian as she describes. (And I\u2019m still thinking about those charred green beans with tahini and mint.)Who I\u2019m FollowingSam Youkilis for the warm-weather places. Cora Harrington aka The Lingerie Addict since I heard that Call Your Girlfriend episode. Lukas Volger, who\u2019s not a new follow but he\u2019s back on his #28daysofoatmeal, and I'm watching like it's Russian Doll.Until next week,Amanda ShapiroHealthyish EditorP.S. I still don\u2019t know how to pronounce this natural alternative to retinol that our skincare writer Deanna Pai investigated, but I\u2019ve been saying bah-koo-chee-oil to myself for the last few days, and it\u2019s making me laugh.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishHealthyish NewsletteressayRead MoreLifestyleWhen Cooking Is a CompulsionBy Amanda ShapiroRecipes you want to make.
