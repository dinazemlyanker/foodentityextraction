For this kind of work, I had all the support I needed: a fancy desk, new laptop, and double monitor. But after I quit I suddenly went from hours of sitting to hours of standing on my feet in my small apartment kitchen: baking for pop-ups, testing recipes for a cookbook, making custom cakes for people who would DM me on Instagram, and, inevitably, constantly cleaning up after myself.The internet is home to plenty of debate about the \u201cbest\u201d shoes for restaurant industry professionals. Danskos, Birkenstocks, or Blundstones\u2014everyone has a preference. But consider the home cook. The daily grind of standing to prepare meals, lifting heavy pots or sacks of flour, and tackling multiple full dish loads really takes a similar toll on your body. At the end of the day I would flop down on the couch with throbbing feet and aching joints, yearning for a solution.That\u2019s where my OOFOS OOahh Slide Sandals came in. I first heard about these foam slippers on a podcast and ordered a set immediately. They have a slight rocking motion that helps improve balance and posture, enabling more stable footing while standing, and they\u2019re available in basic colors as well as patterns like blue snakeskin and Y2K daisy. According to the brand\u2019s website, they absorb 37% more impact than traditional footwear, which, after a full day on your feet, really adds up. Multiple commenters on Instagram and their website refer to these OOFOS slides as \u201crecovery sandals\u201d because they help prevent wear and tear injuries and relieve foot pain. I can attest: I\u2019ve found them to be the perfect balance of soft, stable, and supportive\u2014a combo deal that cushions my feet and takes the pressure off my knees and joints.OOFOS Slides$54 at Amazon$60 at Nordstrom$60 at OofosAesthetically, they definitely give off slight grandma vibes\u2014in a kind of cute way? I probably wouldn\u2019t wear them out on a date, but they\u2019re just fine for running errands and dropping off my cake orders. Best of all, the patented footbed and proprietary foam is machine washable(!). Once a week I chuck them in with my regular laundry without having to worry about removing any insoles or scrubbing at them with a damp cloth.OOFOS does give you the option to send your sandals back within a month if you\u2019re not totally satisfied with them. But trust me, you won\u2019t want to take them off once you get a pair. I\u2019ve been shuffling around the kitchen in mine for 10 months and they\u2019ve totally changed my cooking game. I can stand comfortably for way longer, and now I channel all of that former sore feet angst into whisking eggs and frosting cakes. Plus, they feel like a little hug for my feet, which is just what we all need right now.Get the socks:Turnip The Beet Veggie Socks$10 at AmazonExplore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingHighly RecommendCultureRecipes you want to make.
