See our past recommendations here!If you grew up on frozen pizza rolls, you\u2019re gonna love Snow Days\u2019. They\u2019ve got all of the same salty, tomatoey, gooey goodness, with an ingredient list that reads more like a salad: olive oil, carrot, sweet potato, spinach, apple cider vinegar, and tomato. In comparison with regular store-bought pizza rolls that have, like, 60 ingredients (I stopped counting somewhere between titanium dioxide and modified corn starch), Snow Days pizza bites are made from just 21\u2014all of which are entirely recognizable and totally delicious. They come in sausage, buffalo chicken, veggie white, and classic cheese pizza flavors, and since trying them I\u2019ve spent every Friday afternoon lazing on the lawn with a bowl o\u2019 bites and an Aperol spritz, channeling snow day vibes in the summer.Founder Jason H. Karp was diagnosed with several autoimmune diseases in his 20s, which motivated him to create a pizza bite free of grains, gluten, artificial ingredients, and preservatives. As someone who used to run a gluten-free cannabis baking company, I understand how difficult it is to produce structurally sound and texturally delightful foods sans wheat flour\u2014but I genuinely loved the pizza bites\u2019 cassava flour dough. After eight or nine minutes in a 400\u00b0F oven (heed Snow Days\u2019 instructions; I overcooked mine the first time and they burst like tiny, marinara-filled balloons), the bites returned crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. Perfetto!Because they are nugget-size, my only gripe is that once you start eating them, it\u2019s basically impossible to stop. But fellow pizza connoisseur Elizabeth Gilbert, while preparing to part with her sun-drenched Roman apartment in Eat Pray Love, once declared the denial of harmless pleasures a moot point: \u201cThe easiest, most fundamentally human way to say it is that I have put on weight,\u201d she wrote of her sabbatical spent gorging pizza, pasta, and a particularly dreamy-looking asparagus and egg situation. \u201cI exist more now than I did four months ago.\u201dPhotograph by Emma FishmanGrain-Free Pizza Bites, 2-Pack$35 at Snow DaysExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishHealthyish Loves ItShoppingRecipes you want to make.
