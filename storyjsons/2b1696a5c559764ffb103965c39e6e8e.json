And that\u2019s why Jessie YuChen\u2019s Special Steamed Whole Fish was a revelation. By nestling a whole fish atop a bed of onions, ginger, and scallions instead of on a steaming rack, YuChen avoids calling for any special equipment. Plus, YuChen puts to rest, once and for all, the false assumption that steamed food is drab, bland, or boring. As the fish cooks, the aromatics at the bottom of the pot perfume its flesh and the juices from the fish seep back into the aromatics, creating a built-in brothy, tender vegetable side. It\u2019s a delicious give-and-take.The good news is you can use this technique with almost any veg or protein you have in your fridge. Here are YuChen\u2019s tips on how to do it successfully.Get creative with your protein.A whole fish, like in YuChen\u2019s recipe, makes for a stunning presentation, but it\u2019s not the only option. Blocks of firm, marinated tofu, whole prawns, lobster, crab, and pork or seafood meatballs are all delicious here\u2014just be careful about steaming more than one type of protein at once, as they\u2019re likely to have different cook times. As a general rule of thumb, you\u2019ll want to stay away from proteins that typically need a good sear to taste their best. Red meat and poultry may not be at their best in this application.Pick a sturdy veggie base.\u201cLook for veggies with structure,\u201d YuChen says. This isn\u2019t the time to reach for the greens in your crisper drawer that\u2019ll wilt at the first kiss of heat (hello, baby spinach and watery lettuce). Instead, you\u2019ll want hardier vegetables, like winter squash, roots like daikon radish, oyster mushrooms, the whites of scallions, broccoli or cauliflower, or a bed of greens that you\u2019re okay with going tender (kale, bok choy, cabbage). \u201cIt will work for any vegetable with a steaming time of around 8 minutes,\u201d YuChen advises.You\u2019ll want to cut your vegetables evenly to ensure uniform cooking time and to offer a level surface for your protein to rest on. Make sure your vegetable base elevates your protein at least a couple of centimeters above the bottom of the pan\u2014otherwise, you\u2019ll be braising rather than steaming.It\u2019s all about the aromatics.This is the fun part. Add a wide variety of aromatics to your vegetable base (the ratio of aromatics to vegetables is up to you and what you have available), as they make up the bulk of the flavor your protein will soak up during the steaming process. Fresh ginger, scallion greens, garlic, Thai basil, onions, lemongrass, fennel bulb, leeks, celery, shallots, or even slices of bright citrus (great as a bed for firm, white fish) are all game. While you may want to pick out tougher, more fibrous aromatics like ginger and lemongrass before eating, most will cook down to a saucy consistency to be enjoyed over your protein when serving. \u201cYou can really customize it with what you have on-hand,\u201d says YuChen, making this a technique you can add to your arsenal of one-pot weeknight cooking\u2014no unwieldy steaming equipment required.Getting steamyJessie\u2019s Special Steamed Whole FishA showstopping whole fish is a Lunar New Year staple.
