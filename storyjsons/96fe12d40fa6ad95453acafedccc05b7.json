The patties\u2019 scent and color comes from saffron, a staple in Persian cookery, which is ground into a powder to draw out intense color and flavor. Adding a bit of water to the powder makes the magic happen: A pool of intense vermillion forms, to be added to your eggs and potatoes. A combination of baking powder and baking soda lightens the batter as it cooks, making for fritters that are crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Most people who regularly use saffron grind a whole pack in a spice grinder. This isn\u2019t a good solution if you use it once a year as it will fade like any other ground spice. A teaspoon of ground saffron is way too much and would taste medicinal. Somewhere btwn 1/4 and 1/2 tsp of ground saffron would suffice. \n\nThere\u2019s nothing quite like saffron to take a simple dish to the next level. If \u201cpotato pancakes\u201d aren\u2019t your thing then don\u2019t dress them up. Hell, don\u2019t make them at all!HeidariTehran12/5/2021For anyone freaking out about the saffron, you can stretch it to a point with some tumeric dissolved in water.  It would be delicious even without the saffron, but please Google traditional Persian recipes before advising weird additions or replacements.  Less is moreSaskiaSanta Monica12/5/2021... 'no' dice cucharada de 'azafr\u00e1n en polvo' (mucho dinero), sino 'moler' seria en grano (barato en dinero) en un mortero; en fin ''lean bien' o, ir a un curso de an\u00e1lisis y comprensi\u00f3n de texto ... ( una bromita, no vayan).Anonymous12/1/2021Swap out saffron for a little smoked paprika or regular paprika if saffron is out of your budgetAlyx Coe11/26/2021This recipe, like it says is based on Persian cuisine AND saffron is commonly used in their recipes. Don't use it if it's too expensive for you. My goodness! jlgrinage11/24/2021Holy smokes, that is a gold-mine worth of saffron. \nThis peasant budget won\u2019t stretch that far. CaramelloBeeBrisbane, QLD11/22/2021Potato pancakes with a fortune sort of saffron- get realAnonymousAlbuquerque NM11/20/2021Think! Please!  If it were your own money you were spending, would you blow twenty five or thirty dollars on the saffron called for in this recipe to make potato fritters?!   Recipe developers, and traditional recipe copiers, often forget that many of the ingredients called for in old recipes may be rare and very expensive in this country today.  To be relevant, if that is the ultimate aim and not only selling gadgets and advertising, come down from the Ivory Tower to where the rest of us live.
