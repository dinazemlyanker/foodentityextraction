But you know what the real spice of life is? Comfort. Consistency. Guaranteed, low-risk, high-reward pleasure. I\u2019ve become a person that has no problem accepting the fact that variety stresses me out sometimes. I go to the same coffee shops and restaurants and bars over and over again because I know that I like them. Sure, I sprinkle in new spots occasionally, but I\u2019d rather eat at a place that I know for a fact will make me happy. And while a younger me would probably look at this predictability as offensive and boring, I have grown to realize that this is just me becoming more confident in what I want for myself. I want to grow to be the old man that sits at the same table at the same restaurant every Sunday evening, until he or the restaurant calls it quits.And that same thought goes for dinner at home. You might be thinking, This guy is an editor at a food magazine! Every night his dinner is a wonderful adventure! How lovely and exciting and romantic it must be! Well, it is lovely and romantic for me, but an exciting adventure it is not. I\u2019m the type who discovers a thing I really enjoy eating or making and then I make the hell out of it over and over again. That\u2019s how I\u2019ve found myself eating this month\u2019s Rent Week recipe\u2014a dead-simple dinner of crunchy, raw vegetables tossed in a spicy dressing served over hot white rice\u2014at least once a week for the past couple months.Predictable? Sure. Flavorful, affordable, quick, and satisfying? Absolutely. Guaranteed to make me (and hopefully you) happy? Damn right. This dish is the poster child of Rent Week dining. It does not fail to make me smile every time I eat it. And in the interest of maintaining that chilled out, comfortable vibe, I made this Psych-ish Spring playlist (filled with psychedelic tunes and absolutely free of charge) for you. So smash the play button and get ready to be dropped into a blissful, delicious state of existence.The first thing you need to do is toast some sesame seeds. Pour about \u00bc cup of raw sesame seeds into a non-stick skillet, spreading them across the entire pan, and heat them over medium. When the seeds start to take on a golden color, give the seeds a stir and continue to cook them until they start to turn a deep, golden brown. (Just make sure to pull them before they're all dark; they'll continue to brown as they cool.) Transfer them to a dish. This whole process should take about 5 minutes.Now you have to make a pot of white rice. Measure your grains. Rinse your grains. Measure your water. And then proceed to make rice in whatever way you usually do. Everyone has their own method, but if you\u2019d like a little refresher, we\u2019ve got you. While the rice is cooking, you can tend to your vegetables.Crunchy Bois (Trademark Pending)\nPhoto by Chelsie CraigAnd this dish is all about those crispy, crunchy vegetables. Their texture is what makes this whole affair both interesting and refreshing, and for that reason radishes and cucumbers are my vegetables of choice. Both have high water content and a pleasant texture, exactly what you want to be coated in a spicy sauce.Wash and trim the greens off of 12 radishes, and chop them into quarters. Any kind of radish will do, but red radishes will be the easiest to find. Next, slice 1 large English cucumber lengthwise into quarters, so you\u2019re left with four long spears. Chop across the spears, so you have a bunch of 1\u201d wedges. These should be big enough to eat in one bite. You\u2019re going for a streamlined consumption process. Finely chop a handful of cilantro leaves and tender stems. You\u2019ve taken care of the fresh stuff. Great job.It\u2019s time for sauce, which is admittedly the most involved part of this otherwise straightforward recipe. And it really isn\u2019t that involved at all. The sauce we\u2019re going to coat these vegetables in is spicy, sweet, toasty, fresh, salty, and umami-forward. It brings literally everything to the table. And if you don't already have all of these ingredients in your fridge/pantry, consider changing that\u2014think of it as your Rent Week arsenal, ready to bring big flavor to the table when you're making dinner out of odds and ends.This is what my Monday or Tuesday or Wednesday or Thursday night looks like.\nPhoto by Chelsie CraigStart with 3 Tbsp. of gochujang in a large mixing bowl. (If you can\u2019t find gochujang, you can use a substitution of 1 Tbsp. miso and 2 Tbsp. sambal oelek.) Grab a microplane and grate 2 cloves of garlic. Add 1\u00bd Tbsp. honey, 3 Tbsp. rice vinegar, 1 Tbsp. toasted sesame oil, a couple pinches of kosher salt, and half of the toasted sesame seeds from earlier. Finally, stir in the chopped cilantro.Grab those chopped radishes and cucumbers and throw them into your mixing bowl, tossing them so they\u2019re coated with the sauce. Scoop up a bit of that steamed white rice, spoon some of the crunchy vegetables over top, and sprinkle some toasted sesame and chopped cilantro over it all. The bite that follows will be a flavor journey that is especially intense because of the dish\u2019s simplicity.Do you taste that? That\u2019s the taste of a routine being formed. That\u2019s the taste of comfort and predictability and guaranteed satisfaction. That\u2019s the crunch of vegetables that will always be there for you. That\u2019s the spice of life. Actually, it\u2019s possible that the spice is just the gochujang.Not in a crunchy vegetable mood? Fine.
