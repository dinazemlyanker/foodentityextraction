There's a new sheriff in town.By Alex DelanyMarch 28, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Chelsie CraigFacebookTwitterEmailDid you know the plural version of spectrum is spectra? I didn\u2019t. But then I decided to write about spectrums in the introduction to this installment of Rent Week, and lo and behold, I learned that spectrums isn\u2019t a real word. Wild stuff. Now I\u2019m going to use spectra to linguistically flex on all my friends. But here\u2019s the point: People talk about all different spectra. There\u2019s the UV Spectrum. There\u2019s the Human Sexuality Spectrum and the Electromagnetic Spectrum. There\u2019s the Political Spectrum. There\u2019s the Radio Spectrum and the How Many Drinks Should You Have on a First Date Spectrum. They\u2019re all very important spectra, but in all this spectra talk and debate, we habitually overlook one of the most important spectra in existence.Have you ever heard of the Homemade Quesadilla Spectrum?Yeah. Didn\u2019t think so. But that\u2019s honestly fine. The Homemade Quesadilla Spectrum functions like any other spectrum. There are two extremes, with an infinite number of points falling in between them. At its simplest, the Homemade Quesadilla Spectrum looks like this:You get it. It\u2019s a spectrum. But it\u2019s an interesting spectrum, because a seemingly simple food such as the quesadilla actually has many different factors that determine where on the spectrum it falls. Good cheese, a hot skillet, and quality tortillas push it toward the Exquisite end. Lack of sauce, a microwave, or dry, poorly-seasoned meat can push it toward the Terrible end.For a portion of my life, my feet were planted firmly at the Terrible end of the spectrum. We\u2019ll call this phase college. The quesadillas I made were filled with dry, cubed chicken breast, whatever shredded cheese was already inside my mini-fridge or the cheapest at the closest convenience store, and tortillas that really shouldn\u2019t have been called tortillas. I made quesadillas like this because I didn't know any better. I hadn\u2019t eaten the great quesadillas of my lifetime, and I wasn\u2019t an exceptional cook.But then I learned to cook. And I had the good fortune to eat some really great quesadillas. And the state of my quesadilla affairs became more clear. I needed to start moving toward the opposite end of the spectrum. I didn\u2019t want to lose what the quesadilla had been to me\u2014the greatest 3 a.m.  drunk-snack of all time\u2014but I wanted to honor it in a more serious way. Which is how I ended up with this month\u2019s Rent Week recipe: a braised chipotle chicken and charred scallion quesadilla. It\u2019s exactly what I want when I'm craving the dorm room microwave special, but more refined and infinitely more delicious.So it\u2019s time to follow me on this journey. Smash the play button on this Full Spectrum playlist I made you (with a full spectrum of vibes and completely free of charge), and get ready to move past those dorm room quesadillas.You start with the chicken. In order to really bring it, you want your chicken to be tender, saucy, and flavorful. You can\u2019t have a truly top-notch chicken quesadilla if the chicken stinks. That\u2019s why I braise chicken thighs in crushed tomatoes for my quesadillas. You might think that\u2019s a bit involved, but braising chicken thighs takes way less time that you might think.Season 4 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs with kosher salt and chipotle chile powder. Place them in a Dutch oven, skin-side down, and turn your stove to medium-high heat. You want to render the fat and brown the skin of the chicken. Let them sear without touching them for about 8 minutes. Flip a thigh to check your progress. If it easily releases from the pan, and the skin is browned and crispy, flip them all. Let the non-skin side cook for 4 minutes, and remove the thighs from the pan. They\u2019re not fully cooked, but you\u2019ll come back to them later.Charred scallions will always make things better.\nNow you have a nice bit of chicken fat in your Dutch oven. Add 4 smashed and peeled garlic cloves and 1 white onion, cut into six wedges, to the Dutch oven. Season with salt and leave the garlic and onions undisturbed to brown in the Dutch oven. After about 5 minutes, place the chicken thighs back into the pan and pour in 1 28oz. can of crushed tomatoes, season with salt and a few pinches of chipotle chile powder. You want to make sure the thighs are fully covered in tomato. If they aren\u2019t, add a bit of water, until they are submerged. Turn the heat to low, and let the chicken braise for about 25 minutes.While the chicken is braising, you need to char some scallions. I always like to have something green in a quesadilla. It makes me feel like less of a sophomore, plus it usually tastes good. Wash and dry 1 bunch or 10 scallions. Heat a glug of olive oil in a cast-iron skillet over medium-high and place the scallions in it in such a way that all of the white ends are in contact with the skillet. Don't touch them. Leave them undisturbed for about 4 minutes, then turn the scallions to char on the other side. This isn\u2019t the time to be delicate. You want some serious color. When the scallions have charred, take them out of the pan and slice them widthwise into thirds and place them in a small bowl for future quesadilla construction.Has it been 25 minutes? Yes, it has. Your chicken has been braising away in that simmering tomato sauce. Take the Dutch oven off of the heat, and remove the chicken thighs, placing them in a medium mixing bowl. You\u2019re going to shred that chicken. This is best done with two pairs of tongs, but one pair of tongs and a fork will also do. Remove the bones and shred the meat into chunks of varying sizes. Once the chicken is shredded, ladle a couple spoonfuls of the braising liquid over the meat and stir to coat. You really want each piece of chicken to be dripping with juice.Whether you go with something pre-shredded or something like queso Oaxaca, you want a melty cheese.\nPhoto by Chelsie CraigLet\u2019s talk cheese and tortillas for a minute. When it comes to tortillas, American grocery stores are filled with terrible ones. While this is Rent Week, I'm the type of crazy person who buys quality flour tortillas online so that I always have a stash of the good stuff in my freezer, so...yeah, there's that. I get really great Sonoran-style tortillas from Caramelo, which are small and loaded with pork fat. But if this is all a bit too extra for you, just head to a Mexican market or a grocery store that stocks a lot of Mexican products for a better chance of finding a good tortilla. You should look for refrigerated flour tortillas with condensation in the bag, a sign that they still have some kind of moisture content. And if you can\u2019t find a great flour tortilla, well, just use whatever you can find.Cheese-wise, my ideal quesadilla is loaded with queso Oaxaca, but shredded mozzarella (Mozzarella is actually similar to queso Oaxaca) or shredded cheddar will work too. As long as the cheese is melty, it\u2019s going to work. Again, we\u2019re talking about a spectrum here, so sliding down a bit in one regard isn\u2019t the worst move, if you\u2019re sliding up on every other component. But yeah, if you can find queso oaxaca, get that.Now you have to build your quesadillas. The most important tip I can give\u2014and I really cannot stress this enough\u2014is that you don\u2019t want to overfill your quesadilla. A quesadilla shouldn\u2019t feel hefty. It should be on the thinner side, snackable and self-contained.Don't go wild when building your quesadilla. Less is more.\nPhoto by Chelsie CraigJust enough chicken to cover half of the circle, with some space left around the edge. Just enough scallions to get some in every bite. And just enough cheese to get in the nooks and crannies. As is the case with pizza, \"extra cheese\" always sounds like a way better idea than it is in practice. The fillings should be balanced and the portions humble. You should want to eat two, unless you're working with massive tortillas.Heat a glug of olive oil over medium heat in the same cast-iron skillet you used earlier. If your tortillas have a high fat content (like those Caramelo beauties), you won\u2019t need oil. But most grocery store tortillas require a bit to prevent sticking.  Fold the blank side of the tortilla over the filled side. Place the tortilla in the pan, and don't touch it. Wait for some serious browning to occur, then flip the tortilla. You want to make sure the cheese is visibly melted before removing it from the pan.Crispy Boys.\nPhoto by Chelsie CraigEat these immediately. Quesadillas that sit around are not great. The cheese congeals, and the crispy tortillas get soggy. These should be made to order.Serve them up with a bit of sour cream and a little bowl of the tomato-y braising liquid for dipping. Do you feel that? That was you sliding to the Exquisite end of the Homemade Quesadilla Spectrum. It doesn\u2019t all happen at once. There\u2019s no pressure to evolve immediately. But if you work at it, improving one aspect of your quesadilla at a time, you\u2019ll eventually be staring at the Terrible end of the spectrum from miles away, saying something like, \u201cRemember when we used to microwave quesadillas?\u201dAnd I\u2019ll say something wise like, \u201cOf course I do. You\u2019ve got to start somewhere. We\u2019re all just quesadillas sliding up and down the spectrum of life.\u201dNevermind. That was stupid. I won\u2019t say that.In more of a pasta mood?
