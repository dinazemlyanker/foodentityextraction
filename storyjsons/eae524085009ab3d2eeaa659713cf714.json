While the beloved Middle Eastern dessert knafeh is usually made in a large round tray, here it\u2019s baked in a muffin tin so that every serving contains more crispy-crunchy, ghee-soaked pastry. Never fear: There\u2019s still plenty of cheese in the middle of each one. Usually, that\u2019s a mix of Arabic cheeses, but in this version, it\u2019s a mix of creamy ricotta and stretchy mozzarella. Food coloring provides the iconic bright orange appearance, but if you skip it, you\u2019ll still get a subtle golden hue. Pro tip: Freeze the shaped knafeh (disposable pans work great for this) and bake them from frozen, adding 3\u20135 minutes to the cook time.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Diamond Crystal or \u00bc tsp. Morton kosher saltOrange food coloring or red and yellow food coloring, preferably oil-based or powder (optional)1lb. fresh or frozen, thawed kataifi (shredded phyllo pastry)1cup (200 g) sugar1tsp. fresh lemon juice1tsp. rose water or orange-flower water (optional)\u00bccup raw pistachios, finely chopped or crushed\u00bccup dried rose petals (optional)Special equipmentDisposable food-grade gloves (optional)PreparationStep 1Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 375\u00b0. Mix mozzarella and ricotta in a medium bowl to combine; set aside.Step 2Place ghee and salt in a small bowl. Add food coloring, if using, to achieve your desired hue (medium orange is a good aim; the color will intensify when the knafeh are baked) and mix vigorously to combine (water-based food coloring won\u2019t completely dissolve into the ghee and that\u2019s okay).Step 3Using a sharp knife, cut kataifi into 1\" pieces and place in a large bowl. Tear strands apart with your hands to separate. Using gloves if desired (the food coloring can stain your hands), pour ghee mixture over kataifi and toss and rub strands until completely coated in ghee. (If using water-based food coloring, it may take some extra time to fully disperse it.)Step 4Working one at a time, scoop about \u00bc cup kataifi mixture into each cup of 2 standard 12-cup muffin pans. Using your hands, pack into cups and create a well for cheese mixture (it should look similar to a bird\u2019s nest). Place a heaping 1 Tbsp. cheese mixture into each well, doing your best to keep cheese centered and away from sides of pan. Divide remaining kataifi mixture among muffin cups (about a packed 1 Tbsp. each) and press down on it with your palm or a spoon to pack. Kataifi mixture should be level or almost level with top of pan and cheese mixture should be barely visible. Bake until crisp, 15\u201320 minutes.Step 5Meanwhile, bring sugar, lemon juice, rose water (if using), and \u00be cup water to a boil in a small saucepan over medium heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until sugar is dissolved, about 3 minutes. Remove pan from heat; set syrup aside.Step 6Remove knafeh from oven. Place an inverted baking sheet over a muffin pan and carefully flip over to unmold knafeh. Repeat with second muffin pan and another baking sheet.Step 7To serve, spoon 1\u20132 Tbsp. reserved syrup over each warm knafeh; top with pistachios and dried rose petals (if using).Do ahead: Knafeh can be formed 3 months ahead. Tightly wrap muffin pans in plastic and freeze.How would you rate Mini Knafeh With Rose and Pistachio?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkExplore Bon App\u00e9titDessertBakingMiddle EasternCheeseMozzarellaRicottaPhylloOther IngredientsRecipes you want to make.
