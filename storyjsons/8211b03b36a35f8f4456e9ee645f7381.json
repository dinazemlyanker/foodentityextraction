The result is a moist, barely sweet cake with pudding vibes. We used Bob\u2019s Red Mill masa harina for this tamal recipe\u2014it has a more pronounced corn flavor than other brands.Ingredients8 servings Nonstick vegetable oil spray1\u00bdcups masa harina (masa flour), preferably Bob\u2019s Red Mill1tsp. baking powder1tsp. kosher salt1tsp. ground cinnamon, plus more for serving4ears of corn, husked, kernels removed, or 4 cups frozen, thawed\u00becup (1\u00bd sticks) unsalted butter, room temperature\u00bdcup raw or demerara sugar1tsp. vanilla extract1cup cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche\u2154cup crumbled queso fresco, plus more for servingPreparationStep 1Preheat oven to 325\u00b0. Lightly coat an 8x8\" metal baking pan with nonstick spray. Whisk masa, baking powder, salt, and 1 tsp. cinnamon in a medium bowl.Step 2Pulse corn kernels in a blender or food processor until very coarsely pur\u00e9ed, just a few seconds should do it.Step 3Using an electric mixer on medium-high speed, beat butter and raw sugar until pale and slightly fluffy, about 3 minutes. Beat in corn pur\u00e9e and vanilla. Reduce speed to low and beat in dry ingredients; mix until batter is smooth, about 2 minutes. Scrape into prepared pan and cover tightly with foil. Set baking pan inside a large roasting pan; pour in boiling water to come halfway up sides of baking pan.Step 4Bake tamal until top springs back when lightly pressed and a tester inserted into the center comes out clean, 75\u201385 minutes. Let cool slightly in pan before serving.Step 5Mix cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche and \u2154 cup queso fresco in a small bowl. Scoop tamal onto plates and top with cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche mixture, more queso fresco, and a dusting of cinnamon.How would you rate Sweet Cinnamon Tamal?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (4)Back to TopTriangleThis tamal is really tasty. I like that it isn't too sweet, and because of that it is great for snacking on. I had my eye on this recipe for a while because I had never made anything like it. What better time to try it out than during a pandemic when we are all stuck at home. I didn't have the ingredients for the creamy topping so used whipped cream - I think the salty cheese would have paired better.AnonymousVancouver, B.C.4/28/2020Rock \u2018n roll. This is delicious! Quite filling. Nice and comforting. Would be great anytime of year, even for a grilling night. Made it with frozen corn. Perfect amount of sweetness. Also delicious without the creme fraiche. I made myself a piece too large to eat. You do not need much to feel fulfilled. Yum. AnonymousMinneapolis, MN3/25/2020This was great! Just don't expect an American dessert. It's not as sweet a typical American dessert. I didn't have creme fraiche so I used 2/3 cup sour cream and 1/3 cup vanilla yogurt. I thought it was sweet enough but the rest of the family sprinkled extra sugar in top too. Very moist. Tastes like you would expect a sweet corn tamale to taste. Anonymous5/6/2019I made it with frozen corn and it was incredible. MOIST. (Also so good for breakfast, not too sweet, great with coffee.) I loved the sour cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche and salty queso fresco mixture, but if that's too cheffy, obviously vanilla ice cream would work too\u2014but that element feels essential if you're making for dessert. Otherwise the tamal would start to get one note, which is corn-corn-corn. But seriously. Making this again and again and again.  alexbeggsBon App\u00e9tit 4/1/2019Explore Bon App\u00e9titPuddingDessertCakeMexicanLatin AmericanMasaRice & GrainsCornVegetableQueso FrescoCheeseCinnamonHerbs & SpicesNut-FreeGluten-FreeHealthyishBakingRecipes you want to make.
