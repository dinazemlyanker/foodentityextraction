So I couldn\u2019t help but wonder who the author would have at her dream gathering\u2014and what they\u2019d talk about.\u00a0What\u2019s your philosophy when composing a dinner party guest list? And which three people do you invite?\u00a0I love planning parties, and I especially love doing seating charts. When you\u2019re hosting a large party, you want to have anchors every four seats or so: people who understand that they\u2019re there to work, to make conversation and include shyer guests. But since this is a small party, I\u2019d be indulgent and instead invite entertainers\u2014people who know how to tell a good story. People who probably don\u2019t know one another but are separated by just one or two degrees. So I\u2019d invite comedian Bowen Yang and playwrights Tony Kushner and Jeremy O. Harris. Playwrights make good guests because they know how to make conversation.\u00a0What is on the menu?It\u2019s best to serve food that has emotional meaning and reveals something personal about you. Whenever I go home to Hawaii, I always ask my mother to make kook soo, a Korean dish she makes with rice noodles in a pork broth. She tops it with chun (in Hawaii this is mostly made with vegetables like zucchini versus everywhere else, where it\u2019s made with meat), shredded pork tossed in shoyu and green onions, and cucumber namul. I\u2019d also try to trick her into making her mandoo: I folded 500 of them this summer and developed a tic in my hand.Where do you host this gathering? Your home?No, I\u2019d host it at the Park Avenue Armory in New York: a vast space with high ceilings and a table for six in the middle (rectangular, not round). It would be lit with hundreds of black taper candles but still quite dark. There\u2019s no soundtrack, no music. The waiters will wear all black, with black shrouds over their faces like the puppeteers in Bunraku theater. The plates will be the snake pattern by Laboratorio Paravicini. I think the food should be humble and the space grand, or the space should be simple and the food very elevated.\u00a0What\u2019s the talk of the night?If you invite the right people, you get to just sit back and listen to them.You also get to invite one character from your new novel, To Paradise, a three-part epic taking place in alternate past, present, and future versions of NYC. Who?Dr. Charles Griffith, from the third section of the book, which takes place in the year 2093. He\u2019s a virologist in a time of pandemics and has had to make certain moral compromises\u2014I\u2019m always interested in people who in good faith make decisions they later live to regret.To Paradise by Hanya Yanagihara$32 $20 at AmazonWhere would you dine the next day, to reward yourself for all the hard work?I\u2019d go to Pho T\u00f4-Ch\u00e2u in Honolulu\u2019s Chinatown\u2014it\u2019s the best pho I\u2019ve ever had in America. The restaurant is run by three elderly siblings, and they always remember my order: the No. 1, with raw steak on the side and extra culantro, plus spring rolls and their house-made lemon soda.Explore Bon App\u00e9titDream Dinner PartyPop CultureInterviewsRecipes you want to make.
