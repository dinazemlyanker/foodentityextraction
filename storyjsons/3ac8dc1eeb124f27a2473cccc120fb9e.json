We\u2019ve pledged allegiance to tahini-ranch, chile crisp, and miso-mustard dressing, but even our most trustworthy vinaigrettes feel tired eventually. So we borrowed a trick from Gerado Gonzalez's vegan Caesar recipe and swapped some of the oil with blended nuts creates a toasty, rich dressing that's unbelievable creamy\u2014no dairy necessary.Exhibit A: This spicy cashew dressing, developed by senior associate food editor Molly Baz. The recipe uses deeply toasted cashews in place of half the oil along with fiery chile flakes, funky-savory fish sauce, a hint of honey, and a shot of bright rice vinegar. Make it vegan if you wish by swapping honey for maple syrup and fish sauce for soy sauce, but don\u2019t skip the deeply toasted nuts. They\u2019re infinitely more flavorful and aromatic than their raw counterparts. \u201cThis dressing hits the flavor notes of a Caesar but leans on cashews for some of the fat, because blending in deeply toasted nuts is like blending in oil,\u201d Baz says. (Pro tip: senior food editor Chris Morocco used a similar technique to make a miso-hemp dressing for folks who don\u2019t eat nuts.)If you\u2019re working with raw cashews, start by tossing one cup of nuts with two teaspoons of oil and a half teaspoon of salt, then roast at 325\u00b0F until fragrant and darker in color. It should take about 15 minutes, at which point your kitchen should smell toasty and delicious.Then blend whole thing together with warm water, vegetable oil, and garlic until it\u2019s smooth and pourable. It should only take a minute or two\u2014I whipped up this dressing at 11 p.m. on a Wednesday and had no regrets.This cashew dressing is powerfully flavored, so it stands up to sturdy chicories, roasted vegetables, and whole grains. Serve it over a dinner-worthy salad with radicchio and roasted sweet potatoes, or hold back a few tablespoons of water to make a savory dip for crudit\u00e9s. Or, if you\u2019re me, skip the pleasantries and dip some stray carrots straight into the blender. It might not be a salad (okay, it\u2019s definitely not a salad), but it\u2019s definitely delicious.Salad dressing forever:Spicy Cashew DressingInspired by the nut-based Caesar dressings at NYC\u2019s Lalito and Scarr\u2019s Pizza, our version starts with roasted cashews.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishSalad DressingSaladCashewRead MoreLifestyleHow to Make a Killer Fruit Salad No Matter the Time of YearBy Carla Lalli MusicRecipes you want to make.
