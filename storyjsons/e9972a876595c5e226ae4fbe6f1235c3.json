Marlon, holding a box of DiGiorno Crispy Pan Pizza, had a big grin on his face. My look was a bit more \u201cUm...seriously?\u201dIt\u2019s not that I\u2019m a pizza snob, but on the occasions that I do buy a frozen pizza, I reach for those pricey ones from hipster mecca Roberta\u2019s in Bushwick. I\u2019m also well versed in the naturally leavened, doughy ways of Neapolitan pies. And I\u2019m up on all those joints that mill their own grains. So, yeah, maybe a little snobby.Which is to say I\u2019ve never been a DiGiorno guy (it wasn\u2019t around during my teenage Stouffer\u2019s French Bread Pizza days). But this Crispy Pan Pizza\u2014let me explain. It bakes in its own pan, made from I\u2019m not exactly sure what. When you lift the pie from its home, the bottom is all buttery and golden and, yes, crispy, not unlike the Detroit-style pies that everyone is so gaga for these days. The sauce leans a little bit sweet, in a good way. The cheese, if you leave the pie in the oven for a bit longer than prescribed, gets all bubbly and well browned. The dough itself can best be described as pillowy.Short story short: we now have DiGiorno Night at home, with mom and dad going to town as much as Marlon. Because now we\u2019re not just pizza snobs\u2014we\u2019re DiGiorno Crispy Pan snobs.Buy it: DiGiorno Crispy Pan Pizza $10 on AmazonAll products featured on Bonappetit.com are independently selected by our editors.
