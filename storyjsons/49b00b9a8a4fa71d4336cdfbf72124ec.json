One of the reasons is because the good fat in olive oil makes it an optimal replacement for butter, making it a nice alternative for desserts, too. As a general rule, 1 Tablespoon of butter in a recipe is equivalent to 2 \u00bc teaspoons of olive oil. For larger measurements, 1 cup (or 2 sticks) of butter is equal to \u00be cup of olive oil. The next time you\u2019re baking up a batch of sweets, swap out the butter for rich and smooth olive oil. They\u2019ll taste even sweeter knowing you\u2019re nourishing your body too. Here are a few recipes to get you started.Olive Oil Bundt Cake with a Tangerine GlazeOlive oil cake is, in itself, a deliciously moist and easy-to-make pastry. Add a citrusy, tangerine glaze to this classic cake, and it just may be sheer perfection. Colavita\u00ae Olive Oil perfectly complements the tangy, orange-flavored icing, which lends just the right amount of sweetness.Peanut Butter and Jelly SquaresTurn an everyday standard into a craveable snack with this recipe for sweet, crumbly Peanut Butter and Jelly Squares. Colavita\u00ae Olive Oil adds extra richness. We love using whole peanuts in this recipe for an extra-crunchy texture and while grape may be the traditional jelly go-to, use your favorite flavor of jam to make it your way.Cranberry, Pistachio, and Orange SconesWhether it\u2019s for breakfast, lunch, or afternoon tea, this flavorful twist on the traditional scone is a crowd pleaser on any occasion. A mixture of butter and olive oil do double duty on moistness, while an icing made of freshly squeezed orange juice and powdered sugar is the perfect finish.Pumpkin WafflesPut a healthy twist on breakfast with these all-season Pumpkin Waffles made with oats and wheat flour, cinnamon, pumpkin pur\u00e9e, and of course, Colavita\u00ae Olive Oil. Add a little extra Colavita\u00ae Olive Oil right on the waffle iron before pouring in the batter to ensure a crisp outer crust\u2013\u2013the perfect foundation for a little drizzle of maple syrup.Strawberry Cheesecake with Olive Oil CrustWhether it\u2019s for a special occasion or simply a weekend made for baking, this Strawberry Cheesecake gets its flavorful, easy-to-make graham cracker crust from Colavita\u00ae Olive Oil.  Blended with walnuts or pecans, graham crackers, sugar and olive oil, this crust becomes a doughy foundation for a great filling. Want to save time? Pick up store-bought vanilla meringues to add as a topper for a deceivingly impressive yet dazzling finish.A Butter to Olive Oil Cheat-Sheet:Discover more recipes at colavitarecipes.com.Recipes you want to make.
