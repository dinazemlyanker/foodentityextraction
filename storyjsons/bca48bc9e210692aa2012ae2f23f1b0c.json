The ability to make any situation a little more comfortable is, well, comforting, especially now that I\u2019m armed with a new tool: dissolvable CBD strips.I know, I know. Everyone is going crazy for CBD these days. I suspect this is because living on this flaming fireball of a planet is rough, and, between scrolling through breaking news updates and trying to make it to yoga on time, we're constantly searching for ways to chill the F out. I keep several CBD oils at my desk to mitigate the stress of deadlines and to-do lists, but those little (and expensive!) glass bottles don\u2019t bode well for chilling out when you're, say, trapped on the subway or in traffic or waiting in line at Trader Joe's.Kin Slip's Park Life blend.\nPhoto by Emma FishmanThat's where Kin Slips come in. The sublingual strips provide a precise dose of CBD without you having to fiddle with a dropper, and they come in a palm-sized pack that\u2019s easy to shove into an overcrowded purse or jacket pocket. Their CBD blend, cutely named \"Park Life,\" has 10 mg CBD and 1mg THC per strip, along with terpenes like Beta caryophyllene, limonene, and linalool. And no, that 1mg of THC won't get you high. It's there to boost CBD's potency through something known as the \"entourage effect,\" which uses the whole cannabis plant (including small amounts of THC) to purportedly improve the effectiveness of CBD.I also love that the strips are flavored with mango and turmeric for a pleasantly earthy, slightly sour flavor.They're also sugar-free, vegan-friendly, non-GMO, and very easy to use. Place a small, moss-like square under your tongue and let the sweetness seep out, filling your mouth with the taste of mango and sending CBD directly into your bloodstream. (Sublingual products enter your body through the thin membrane under your tongue, allowing them to kick in much faster than edibles, which are broken down in the liver.) The tiny square dissolves in a minute or two, and I tend to feel the effects about ten minutes later.I find that it helps ease some of the sensations of anxiety\u2014tight chest, tense back, clenched stomach\u2014that I tend to feel in high stress situations. A sense of calm sets in behind my eyes, and the sharp, anxious edges of my mind soften. And because these strips are individually wrapped like sticks of gum, it's easy to share the chill. It\u2019s thought that CBD works best when taken daily, so I still rely on my tinctures to reap those long-term effects. But once I\u2019m out in the world, in all its beautiful and messy and sometimes stressful glory, it\u2019s nice to know that I have CBD in my pocket.Before you buy, consider consulting a medical practitioner and checking cannabis laws in your area.
