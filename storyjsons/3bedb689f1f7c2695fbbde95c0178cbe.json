On the pro side, I can sprawl out naked in the living room. But there are things about sharing that I miss\u2014like when I\u2019d use her collection of expensive travel-size face masks when she wasn\u2019t home. (Sorry, Chrissy, it was me.) Or sneak a piece of chocolate from her stash when the craving hit but I was too lazy for a bodega trip. But the thing I miss the most? Her Blueland soap and cleaner subscription.Blueland is a direct-to-consumer cleaning products company that is trying to eliminate single-use plastic, one bottle of window cleaner at a time. When you purchase the Clean Essentials kit, you get four simple bottles\u2014a clear glass one with a pump for foaming hand soap, a pink one labeled \u201cbathroom,\u201d a yellow one labeled \u201cmulti-surface,\u201d and a blue one labeled \u201cglass + mirror.\u201d The three spray bottles are made of Tritan, a BPA-free plastic that is shatterproof and sturdy enough to withstand indefinite reuse. The actual soap and cleaners, which are made using ingredients that are all transparently displayed on Blueland\u2019s website, come in tablet form\u2014another sustainable choice. Shipping small tablets is more efficient than moving liquid-filled bottles from point A to point B. When it's time to refill, just plop the color-coded tablet into its bottle, add water, and you\u2019re ready to use!The sustainable packaging and subscription service is great and all, but more important, Blueland soap and cleaning products actually work. They smell so fresh\u2014like the scent of orange peels lingering on your fingertips after you peel a ripe Sumo\u2014and I only need a small spritz to clean my hands, grease, hard water stains, or the ring of coffee my morning cup inevitably leaves on the table.The Blueland subscription was my roommate\u2019s, so when we parted ways I also said goodbye to my beloved bottles. But I\u2019m an ~adult~ now, so I guess it\u2019s time to get a subscription of my own.Blueland Clean Essentials Kit$39 at BluelandExplore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingHighly RecommendSustainableCleaningRead MorecultureZip Top Bags Are Helping Me Drop Single-Use Plastic for GoodBy Sarah JampelcultureEvery Single Time I Break Out These Produce Bags, I Get a ComplimentBy Sarah JampelcultureThe Only Kitchen Scrubbing Pad That Matters Is Homax Steel WoolBy Carla Lalli MusicLifestyleHow To (Re)Organize Your Kitchen, According to a Professional OrganizerBy Emma WartzmanRecipes you want to make.
