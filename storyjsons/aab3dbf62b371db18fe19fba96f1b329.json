It\u2019s the closest I\u2019ll ever get to a Zola registry, and for that, I\u2019m relieved. I like to keep my distance. From institutions, not cookies! I like to be close to cookies. Very close.In the powdered sugar-strewn timeline of desserts, there have been many variations on these cookies: Mexican wedding cakes, Italian wedding cookies, butterballs, Russian tea cakes\u2026Regina Schrambling at the Los Angeles Times traces the buttery trail here. But the common link is this: a melt-in-your-mouth cookie made with a shocking amount of butter, powdered sugar, nuts, flour, and vanilla. A double layer of powdered sugar gives them a velvet coating that dissolves on the tongue like a freshly fallen snowflake. Scenic much?Because this is Basically, our recipe is a pared-down, simple version that doesn\u2019t tinker and tweak with added extracts, zests, or alt-flours. However, we do start with brown butter instead of normal butter, which adds a caramel-y, nutty flavor to the already-nutty cookie. Double nut fun! If you\u2019ve never made brown butter, now's your chance to learn and have a whole cookie universe opened up to you. (It\u2019s a game-changer in chocolate chip cookies too.)Brown butter looks like this, if ya wanna know.\nPhoto by Alex Lau, Food Styling by Judy ManciniOnce you\u2019ve made the brown butter (TWO STICKS, BABY!), you chill it \u2018til it\u2019s solid, then cream it with powdered sugar using an electric mixer until it\u2019s all fluffy. After that you mix in the flour, and fold in chopped walnuts and vanilla. That\u2019s your cookie dough\u2014pause to lick spatula clean. After that you MUST chill the dough. Two hours-ish. This cookie dough is pretty much sugared butter and we need that fat to solidify so that when the cookie balls hit the oven, they don\u2019t spread and lose their snowball shape.Powdered sugar bath.\nRoll the cold dough into balls, or shape them gently with your fingers (what I did because my were pretty crumbly and not so easy to roll, Play-Doh style). They bake for 20-25 minutes depending on your oven sitch, but what\u2019s tricky is knowing when they\u2019re done, because we don\u2019t want them browned and golden like choc chips. Notice how doughy, soft, and sticky the raw dough looks, and then keep an eye out to see them firm up and almost look dried out. When they\u2019re still warm, roll them in a powdered sugar bath, let them fully cool, and roll one more time before serving\u2014or stashing, because they\u2019re even better the next day.My cookies came out looking less like perfect snowballs and more like prehistoric rocks, but that\u2019s really the story of my life. The final texture was spot-on, though, with that soft sugar blanket giving way to smooth, shortbread butterballs with crunchy walnut specks. I\u2019d take a bite of cookie, sip of coffee, bite of cookie\u2014and then next thing you know, seven years have gone by and people have finally stopped asking me if I\u2019m just going to marry the cookies already. Nah, we\u2019re good. We\u2019re very happy like this.Get the recipe:Brown Butter Wedding CookiesSix-ingredient cookies for people who don't think they can bake cookies.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titCookieholiday2018Holiday CookiesBrown ButterRecipes you want to make.
