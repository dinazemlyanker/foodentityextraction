If you want this in your inbox before it hits the site, sign up for our newsletter.Hey Basically readers,It\u2019s probably because I just listened to the New York Times\u2019 Sam Anderson read his essay about Weird Al Yankovic, but this week the phrase \u201call she wants to eat is carbs\u201d to the tune of Don Henley\u2019s \u201cAll She Wants to Do is Dance\u201d is running through my brain. She wants potatoes! Ooh! She wants focaccia! Ooh! All she wants to eat is\u2026 all she wants to eat is carbs!It\u2019s true and I\u2019m not fighting it. In an alternate universe, I\u2019d \u201cuse\u201d this \u201ctime\u201d at home to expand my palate and my skills, attempting new dishes every night of the week. And while I\u2019m doing some of that, I\u2019m also giving myself permission to eat the foods that feel comforting and nourishing to me, even if I\u2019ve already had pasta three of the last four meals. Speaking of which...Want this letter before it hits the website?

But because I wanted it as dinner, not as a side, I boiled some linguine, saved a cup or so of the pasta water, then scooted the cheese into the hot pasta and used that starchy liquid to make a very fast, very simple sauce. No cream or butter or emulsifying necessary. I chopped the broccoli rabe into bite-sized pieces and added it to the pot along with lemon juice and zest.And with the extra ricotta, I\u2019m going to make a half-batch of ricotta gnocchi to save in the freezer.Photo and Food Styling by Sarah JampelAn \u201cAssignment\u201dShould You Choose to Accept ItMy mom recently told me she had given my dad an \u201cassignment.\u201d While she was at work (doctor-mom!), my dad\u2019s task was to pick out a dinner recipe that used only ingredients in the house. He chose Andy Baraghani\u2019s Grilled Salmon with Whole Lemon Sauce. They subbed in white sesame seeds for the black ones, and it was a great success. I want to implement this same assignment in my household of two\u2014you pick it, I make it.When the hardest part of making dinner is choosing what to make, outsource that job. Maybe text a friend a few ingredients you\u2019re trying to use up and have them send you a couple recipe options back? Is that annoying? Personally, I\u2019m on a text thread where we compare crispy brussels sprouts recipes, troubleshoot flan, and bat around ideas about what to do with an excess of dried chickpeas (uh, 10 pounds) and I\u2019ve never felt so useful.Photo and Food Styling by Sarah JampelMoment of AppreciationPB&J, Hip Hip Hooray\u201cNo more dishes, I beg of you!\u201d That\u2019s what my husband says to me every single time I even think about entering the kitchen. So for lunch this week I had peanut butter (Maranatha forever) and jelly. I always do it open-faced so that I can more fully control the ratio of bread to smears and continue applying PB as I see fit. It was fast and delicious and there were no pots or pans to clean.This Week I\u2019m Going To\u2026Listen to \u201cStaying In With Kumail and Emily,\u201d a truly delightful podcast from Kumail Nanjiani and Emily V. Gordon; I\u2019m saving the episodes\u2014an hour of silly but thoughtful banter\u2014to listen to during long walks as a form of motivation; all proceeds go to coronavirus researchPlay \u201crank your cousins\u201d as a form of entertainment suggested by aforementioned Kumail and Emily; just kidding\u2014I could never...Make a smoothie for second breakfast (my entire freezer is filled with bananas)Eat Molly Baz\u2019s Smashed Chickpeas on Toast with Harissa YogurtSee you here next week!Recipes you want to make.
