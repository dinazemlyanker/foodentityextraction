It was a bit on the salty side so I will definitely reduce the amount of salt added on top of the fish sauce next time. Didn\u2019t have a grill so just seared the meatballs deeply on all sides in a pan. AnonymousSan Diego7/4/2020Bon App\u00e9tit does it again! Used a cast iron skillet on medium and worked in 2 batches. I would forego the 2 tsp salt next time since the fish sauce adds enough saltiness. We wrapped these up in fresh lettuce with rice and cucumbers. Amazing. Monica PavsSan Jose8/28/2019Absolutely delicious and easy to make . We used beef instead of pork since that\u2019s what was on hand. Could also see turkey being great. I would like to live in the nuoc cham sauce.
