He shares recipes he's been cooking, restaurants he's been eating at, and more. It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.I can\u2019t recall exactly when in the past 10 days Christina Chaey launched her #gentlefoods campaign. And, to be honest, I didn\u2019t really know what she was talking about when she did. But she had me at gentle.As we became a nation of home cooks last week, we approached our newly isolated status with a startling gusto\u2014sharing our creations on Instagram, facetiming with friends as we embarked on ninja-level cooking projects.At the RapoBuck household, I grabbed my cast-iron skillet and fired-up Basic Bulgogi. I batched a double recipe of BA\u2019s Best Bolognese. I made a creamy, leeky, buttery bowl of colcannon that just might have been the most satisfying thing I\u2019ve made all year.Want this letter before it hits the website?

This isn\u2019t the kind of food you can eat night in, night out. And, so, as it has become apparent that we\u2019ll all likely be at home for far longer than we ever imagined, we need a diet that will take care of us. Enter Chaey, a voracious home cook who happens to be our newest newsletter columnist. (You can catch her every Sunday on the Healthyish newsletter; sign up here if you don\u2019t already receive it.)\u201cTo me, \u2018gentle foods\u2019 are the ones that are like a blanket,\u201d says Chaey, who has been with Bon App, off and on, for more than four years. \u201cFor me recently, that\u2019s been things like eggs (not the crispy ones fried in olive oil\u2014too aggressive for me right now), simple clear soups with wilted greens and dumplings, bean stew, poached fish. They\u2019re simple, nutritious and intuitive. Not based on a grocery list so much as what your body wants to consume.\u201dWe can thank chef Cal Peternell for these braised greens.\nPhoto by Chelsie Craig, Food Styling by Dana BonaguraI like the last part the best. We all know what our bodies need; we just choose not to listen much of the time. To get me headed down the gentle path, I asked Chaey for some starter recipes, many of which have popped up in her Instagram stories. There\u2019s BA\u2019s Anything Goes Donabe, a catch-all hot pot that you can make even if you don\u2019t own the elegant, Japanese ceramic cooking vessel. I\u2019m definitely going to make Healthyish\u2019s Simple Khichari, an Indian lentil-and-rice dish that I happen to discuss with Priya Krishna on this Wednesday\u2019s upcoming episode of the Bon App\u00e9tit Foodcast. And because gentle doesn\u2019t have to mean vegetarian, how about some Greens with Braised Pancetta and Garlic?As we navigate the next several months, the most important thing we can do is take care of ourselves and those closest to us. And that starts with what we eat. So keep cooking\u2014and be gentle on yourself.Explore Bon App\u00e9titAdam NewsletterCoronavirusRead MorecultureFrom Pandemic to Protests: How Food Businesses Are RespondingBy The Bon App\u00e9tit StaffCoronavirus7 Tips for Making Your Best Pot of Dried Beans, Even If It's Your FirstBy Caroline LangeLifestyleCooking at a (Social) DistanceBy Christina ChaeyCoronavirus17 Ways to Feel Good at Home Right NowBy Aliza AbarbanelRecipes you want to make.
