We highly encourage you eat them with the shells on\u2014the crunchy texture and smoky flavor they pick up from the grill are all part of the pleasure. But if you\u2019d rather not, go ahead and peel \u2019em before serving. Also, they\u2019re just as delicious chilled as they are hot off the grill, so enjoy them whichever way you like.Ingredients4 servings\u00bdcup plus 1 Tbsp. canola oil, plus more for grill1lb. shell-on shrimp (16\u201320 per lb.)3small garlic cloves, finely grated, divided1\u00bdtsp. Old Bay seasoning, plus more for serving\u00betsp. kosher salt, divided, plus more1large egg yolk2lemons, dividedPreparationStep 1Prepare a grill for medium-high heat. Lightly oil grate. Using kitchen shears, snip down back of each shrimp shell along the vein, stopping at the tails. You may end up cutting a little but of the flesh, but the aim here is to make it easy to peel the shell later (if you choose!) without compromising the shrimp\u2019s tenderness. The shells are a protective barrier, so keep them on when grilling.Step 2Transfer shrimp to a medium bowl. Add 1 Tbsp. oil, two-thirds of garlic, 1\u00bd tsp. Old Bay, and \u00be tsp. salt and toss to combine. Let sit 10\u201315 minutes while you prepare the aioli.Step 3Whisk egg yolk and remaining garlic in a medium bowl. Finely grate 1 tsp. lemon zest into egg mixture. Whisking constantly, gradually stream in remaining \u00bd cup oil until thick and pale yellow. Stir in juice of one lemon half. Season well with salt\u2014it should taste really vibrant.Step 4Cut remaining lemon in half. Grill shrimp and 3 lemon halves (cut sides down) until shells are golden brown and charred in some spots and flesh is opaque and cut sides of lemons are deeply caramelized, 1\u20132 minutes.Step 5Spread aioli on a platter. Arrange shrimp and charred lemons over. Season lightly with more Old Bay.How would you rate Grilled Shrimp with Old Bay and Aioli?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (13)Back to TopTriangleNo outside grill so I do all. my stuff on a cast iron grill pan. Using the broiler and a sheet pan ro spread tboth shrimp and lemon slices was a wonderful idea! (Thank you, Brock Toon) Also had some lemon aoli in the fridge, Added a kick of Old Bay (always a can of it in the cupboard.)  PS:  Eating them with the shells ON? Another new idea!  Thanks, Molly!Loretta Heuer7/28/2021I trust Bon Appetit's superb digital content and it has served me well in the past, so I googled the words: 'Bon Appetit,' 'shrimp,' and 'Old Bay,' Per usual, this one was a hit. I made a few adjustments after botching the aioli the first time and using my oven instead of a grill to cook the shrimp. Firstly, start with less oil and add it in as you mix. If you have a power handheld mixer, that will be an advantage over hand whisking. Someone recommended cayenne pepper a few comments below so I added some red pepper flakes last minute which added a nice kick.  I broiled the shrimp with the oven rack about 5-6 inches away from the broiler for about 2.5 - 3 minutes and it was perfectly cooked. I know I will be making this again in the near future because it was outrageously good.\n\nBrock ToonDetroit12/25/2020This was really great! Some people below said to cut the canola oil in the aioli to 1/4 cup, but I found a full 1/2 canola oil worked fine when I added it very slowly. I added a pinch of cayenne pepper to the shrimp as well, which turned out really good! Great recipe.AnonymousToronto, Canada9/19/2020This was A. MAZE. ING.  I braved a thunderstorm to grill these and it was worth it.  I used olive oil rather than canola oil and served it with some grilled sourdough bread and it was delicious. WINNER! AnonymousPennsylvania6/20/2020Made this recently and it was delicious. The aioli was the perfect complement to the shrimp, and my entire family loved it. The charred lemon slices are so underrated in terms of what they add \u2014 don't skip that step, and squeeze some lemon on every bite you take! The perfect summer dinner.AnonymousBerkeley, CA8/19/2019ugh... 1/2 cup of canola to 1 egg yolk?  BA's best aioli is 1 egg yolk to 1/4 cup olive oil... my first attempt Molly's aoloi was a mess... cut it back to 1/4 cup but the canola still doesn't thicken like olive oil does .... her recipes are honestly hit or miss and this one is a miss with lots of adjustmentsAnonymousnew jersey8/17/2019Made this tonight!
