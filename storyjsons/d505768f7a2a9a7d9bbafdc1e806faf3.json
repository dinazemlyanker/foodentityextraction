There are plenty of other characters that can bring the same pizzazz and brightness to your recipes\u2014if you just give them a chance.Here\u2019s a rundown of our favorite not-herbs that can be treated in much the same way you would the usual suspects\u2014basil, dill, cilantro, parsley, and mint. Throw a handful into a salad, whiz them into a vibrant sauce, or shimmy them into a sandwich. And since they\u2019re also great when combined with proper herb-herbs, feel free to mingle and merge to your heart\u2019s content.Photo by TED+CHELSEA CAVANAUGH, Food Styling by Simon AndrewsCelery LeavesThese magical yellow-green leaves live on the top of stalks and tucked inside the core of a celery bunch; they\u2019ve got an even more intense celery flavor than the stalk itself and are delicious in a salad, vinaigrette, or Bloody Mary.Photo by TED+CHELSEA CAVANAUGH, Food Styling by Simon AndrewsArugulaSkip the feathery salad and throw a handful on top of anything mild or fatty (ricotta! pizza! risotto!) to add a pop of peppery flavor. Arugula also makes for a deliciously spicy pesto.Photo by TED+CHELSEA CAVANAUGH, Food Styling by Simon AndrewsWatercressFiery and slightly sour, we like it in sandwiches, buzzed into green sauces, and chopped into a mustardy potato salad.Photo by TED+CHELSEA CAVANAUGH, Food Styling by Simon AndrewsFennel FrondsThe feathery wisps that crown the top of a bulb of fennel are a built-in garnish for any dish that contains the bulb itself. But fronds can also be used wherever you want fennel\u2019s signature fresh, anise-y flavor but without the bulb\u2019s crispy crunch.TED+CHELSEA CAVANAUGHScallions and ChivesFor a more delicate onion-y flavor that doesn\u2019t dry out your mouth with intense heat, turn to these little alliums. Scallions and chives can be eaten raw\u2014and with abandon!\u2014for lots of flavor without the overwhelming fire you get from red or yellow onions.Photo by TED+CHELSEA CAVANAUGH, Food Styling by Simon AndrewsPea Sprouts and ShootsLeggy and leafy and so adorable it almost hurts, pea sprouts and shoots are sweet, slightly grassy, and about as springy as spring gets. They go well with\u2014you guessed it\u2014peas and will do good work on top your pea mash, pea pasta, or pea soup.These would all be pretty cool in a pesto, TBH:How to Make Pesto Out of Just About AnythingPSA: You don't need pricey pine nuts or even basil to make everyone's favorite green sauce. Here's how to make pesto out of whatever you've got lying around.View StoryExplore Bon App\u00e9titBasicallyherbCeleryArugulaWatercressFennelPea ShootRecipes you want to make.
