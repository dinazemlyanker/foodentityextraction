But she\u2019s willing to make an exception for this perfect sandwich.By Deb PerelmanAugust 16, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Alex Lau, Food Styling by Susie TheodorouFacebookTwitterEmailWelcome back to Picky Eaters\u2019 Club, where Smitten Kitchen\u2019s Deb Perelman reveals what she actually cooks for her two kids.A few years ago, on a summer evening when some friends and their kids were over for dinner, I decided to make \u201chealthy\u201d s\u2019mores. In an effort to avoid overly processed stuff, I bought whole wheat digestive biscuits, organic dark chocolate, and natural marshmallows. The result was, unsurprisingly, terrible. Nobody even finished them. When feeding kids, there\u2019s a feeling of obligation to make what we believe to be wholesome decisions: Replace butter with olive oil; pasta with whole grains; fatty meats with leaner alternatives. But some foods shouldn\u2019t be messed with. Wouldn\u2019t it be tragic if my kids grew up thinking s\u2019mores tasted kind of average?Thick-cut tomatoes to match that thick-cut bacon.\nPhoto by Alex Lau, Food Styling by Susie TheodorouSo when I recently decided to make us BLTs, I vowed not to mess with them. I would use white bread and full-fat mayonnaise. I wouldn\u2019t use kale in place of iceberg. Definitely no turkey bacon. A perfect BLT is a pure and delicious thing that I wanted my kids to experience properly, especially since we only have them a couple of times a year.Grilling the bacon helps stretch the summery vibes into fall, and as a bonus you\u2019ll also save your kitchen from a greasy mess. Thick-cut strips get evenly crisped with a light char at the edges. (Keep the lid closed and vented and the heat relatively low to control flare-ups.) While you\u2019ve got the fire going, grill some bread. Thickly slice a couple of ripe tomatoes. Pile on crisp lettuce and a generous swipe of mayo (we adults love a little Sriracha mixed in). Create what has got to be the highest calling of a summer BLT and serve it with unwavering confidence that not a speck will go uneaten.Get the recipe:Grilled Bacon BLTsHere\u2019s one classic, perfectly executed BLT.
