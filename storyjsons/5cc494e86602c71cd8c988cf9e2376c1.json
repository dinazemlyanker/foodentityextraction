Because whenever I\u2019m brainstorming a vegetarian dinner party dish that won\u2019t require a hundred sides, enchiladas is the answer. Stuffed with beans, greens, and cheese, they\u2019re the all-in-one large format main that has it all. (Don\u2019t worry, I will also make you guacamole.)But not all enchiladas are good enchiladas. What makes the difference? First and foremost, the sauce. All of the extremely opinionated BA food editors agree that the key to successful enchiladas is homemade sauce\u2014and enough of it. In this recipe, the salsa verde is made in the oven: You\u2019ll broil the vegetables (poblanos for smokiness, tomatillos for tang, jalape\u00f1os for heat) until they\u2019re blackened, then blend them up (no chopping!) until you have a spicy, vibrant sauce. Taste it for salt! The sauce is the backbone of the whole dish\u2014it coats every tortilla, it seasons the filling, it gets poured on top\u2014so you\u2019ll want to make sure it\u2019s seasoned to your liking.Second, the filling. If vegetarian enchiladas are going to be a meal, there\u2019s gotta be more than cheese and sauce in there. Even though this filling is super simple\u2014saut\u00e9ed onions and kale mixed with canned pinto beans (they get so creamy!) and a couple of charred poblanos that have been spared from the blender\u2014it\u2019s still green enough to pass for a real serving of vegetables. And because you don\u2019t need to roast a chicken or braise short ribs, the filling comes together in fifteen minutes rather than three hours.Once you\u2019ve got the sauce and the filling, all that\u2019s left is the assembly. Enchiladas are an easy three-step process\u2014dip tortilla in sauce, fill, and roll up and put in a baking dish (see this reference image for help)\u2014unless the tortillas rip during the process, in which case it\u2019s terribly frustrating and will feel like the end of the world*. If you\u2019re using fresh, high-quality tortillas, warming them in a foil pouch in the oven (or individually on the stove) will reduce rippage. But if you\u2019re working with the kinda hard, kinda dry, kinda stale tortillas that are common at grocery stores, I highly recommend a quick dip in a pan of hot olive oil (just 10 seconds per side) to make the tortillas pliable (you know, like they\u2019ve just gone to hot yoga). They\u2019ll also be richer, more flavorful, and more stable  when you cover them with sauce and cheese.If this feels like a lot for one day, split it up: Make the sauce and the filling two or three days in advance, then keep them in the fridge until it\u2019s enchilada night. When your friends ask what they can bring for dinner, you can honestly tell them nothing. Enchiladas have it covered. (Though a bottle of wine would be nice.)*It is not the end of the world. You can either a) go take a walk and make your sous chef struggle through it, or b) just make a layered enchilada \u201ccasserole\u201d situation: alternate layers of sauced-but-flat tortillas with layers of filling, then cover with sauce and bake. Not as elegant, but just as tasty!Get the recipe:Vegetarian EnchiladasThese veggie enchiladas feature a charred tomatillo salsa verde, creamy pinto beans, and plenty of cheese.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishMexicanEnchiladasVegetarianRead MoreLifestyleMarinated Lentils Are Saving My Vegetarian, Protein-Craving SoulBy Sarah JampelRecipes you want to make.
