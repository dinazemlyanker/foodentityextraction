Pro tip: If you sign up for the newsletter, you'll get the scoop before everyone else.Healthyish friends,Last weekend\u2019s trip to L.A. was a whirlwind of exceptional bites (that masa-fried kelp at Onda, that chivichanga at Sonoratown), sips (that rice whiskey at In Sheep\u2019s Clothing), and vibes (every single part of Mercado Sagrado).Now I\u2019m back with a chest cold, jet lag, and a craving for soba. Brothy soba with clams, to be exact, which Sohla El-Waylly developed for Healthyish as a miso-y, sake-infused riff on linguine with clams. I think it\u2019ll pair perfectly with a bottle of Jus Jus, a low-ABV (like 3.5 percent!) sparkling wine that tastes like super-tart grape juice and works as well in a cocktail as it does on its own in a fancy coupe glass.It\u2019s weird to work at a place where you start talking about Thanksgiving in June and are taste-testing turkey by August. Now, finally, the rest of the country is paying attention, and you\u2019re all like GIVE ME ALL THE RECIPES. Well, we got you. And over here at Healthyish, I\u2019m particularly excited about this gluten-free, vegetarian stuffing that [drum-roll please\u2026] doesn\u2019t require making cornbread ahead of time. Andy Baraghani infuses a cornbread batter with all the aromatics, alliums, and mushrooms you want from a good stuffing then bakes everything in one skillet so you have plenty of room in the oven for other stuff.In Sarah Jampel\u2019s monthly column, she writes about why you shouldn\u2019t stress about making a second main course if you or your guests are vegetarian. It\u2019s all about nailing that side dish matrix, which TBH I\u2019d use whether you\u2019re cooking a turkey or not. If you\u2019re still looking for ideas, here are a few of my favorite healthyish-leaning Thanksgiving recipes:Squash with Dates and ThymeTwice Roasted Sweet Potatoes with Hot HoneyRoasted Carrots with Creamy Nuoc Cham DressingKung Pao Brussels SproutsBejeweled RiceGluten-Free Coconut Turmeric PieAnd, lastly, I hate to say these words but, well, shopping season is almost upon us. To make it as low-stress as possible this year, we\u2019ve got one Healthyish gift guide with ideas for all the high-maintenance (and low- and regular-maintenance) people in your life.
