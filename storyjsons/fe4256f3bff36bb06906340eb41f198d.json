See our past recommendations here!Sourdough-baking can be challenging, to say the least. That\u2019s great if you're a tinkerer, experimenter, or problem-solver\u2014but frustrating if you're a perfectionist like me. So when I wanted to pick up bread-baking again after a lengthy hiatus, I didn\u2019t feel guilty about skipping the scariest, most uncertain part of the process: creating the starter itself.After trying twice and failing twice (first with grapes that went moldy, then with pineapple juice) to make my own, I decided to buy a starter from King Arthur, the same employee-owned Vermont-based company where I buy my all-purpose flour (and my not-so-all-purpose boiled cider and Fiori di Sicilia).KAF\u2019s sourdough starter arrives in a little jar, alive and ready to go. (Whereas dry starters have to be rehydrated and revived, fresh starters get fed just a few times\u2014then you can bake.) It\u2019s descended from a starter that\u2019s over 100 years old, so you know it\u2019s going to be bubbly, active, and reliable. Just think of how many loaves have already been born from this starter\u2019s siblings and cousins! Having your starter taken care of doesn't guarantee sourdough success, but at least it won\u2019t be quite as frustrating.Buy it: King Arthur Flour Fresh Sourdough Starter, $9.All products featured on Healthyish are independently selected by our editors.
