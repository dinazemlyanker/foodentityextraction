The 1971 kitchen was full of appliances that were slowly improving, one feature at a time. Don\u2019t ask me why anyone would want a \u201cportable\u201d microwave, or, for that matter, to cook a pot roast in one. But there are many echoes from the 1971 kitchen that we see today\u2014cooks wanted appliances to speed things up (microwave) or slow things down (meet something called the Crock-Pot). They were concerned with the environment, adding trash compactors and smooth-top electric stoves. And they loooved the color avocado. Well, maybe not everything\u2019s the same.Tear Down That Wall1971: In the early \u201970s, Americans were opening their kitchens into the living room, one half-wall at a time. Breakfast bars abounded! The kitchen was becoming a shared family and entertaining space, a place to pull up a stool and hang out.Photo Courtesy Cesar Rubio for Knock Architecture and DesignToday: No signs of going back. Just try to watch a home remodeling show without hearing the phrase \u201copen concept.\u201d Thanks, Joanna Gaines.This Is Garbage1971: Trash compactors, a buzzy new appliance in 1971, crammed a lot into a small space. Heathkit\u2019s Minimizer could fit \u201can entire week\u2019s trash for a family of four into a single, deodorized plastic-lined bag\u201d for $379.95.Today: We\u2019ve taken a lo-fi route: composting.Meet Your Mixmaster1971: The clutch move was to get your Sunbeam Mixmaster Mixer in a color-coordinated shade to match the rest of your kitchen (it came in Chrome, White, and\u2014bet you\u2019ll never guess\u2014Harvest Gold or Avocado).Today: KitchenAid\u2019s stand mixer comes in over 15 colors now, including color-of-the-year Honey, which reminds me of another color I saw in 1971 ads called rusty orange. It also comes in a cast iron black matte option that\u2019ll outlive us all.Photo Courtesy iStock / Kevin RussPatterns Galore1971: Seeking shine without the burden of daily mopping and endless sweeping, Americans somehow thought tile print vinyl flooring, with its eye-crossing patterns and slight cushion underneath, was a sexy-cool-good idea. Until they learned that some manufacturers used asbestos.Photo Courtesy Popham DesignToday: Floors are boring, not-so-shiny neutrals now, made of things like laminate and \u201cengineered wood.\u201d It\u2019s the backsplashes that get to have the fun, with tiles in funky designs and color schemes, as well as peel-and-stick adhesive tiles, which are popular among renters (although maybe not landlords).The Miraculous Microwave1971: For some reason in 1971, manufacturers thought people needed \u201cportable\u201d microwaves to, you know, take out on the patio. Hotpoint\u2019s portable microwave could supposedly make an entire tuna casserole in 15 minutes, which might depend on your definitions of \u201cmake\u201d and \u201ccasserole.\u201d \u00a0Today: Microwave sales go up and down. A sassy salesperson at a Manhattan design center told me \u201cyou young people, nobody wants a microwave anymore!\u201d I detected a hint of disappointment. Instead, some people are using their air fryers to reheat food. There\u2019s also a rise in microwave-size \u201ccombination\u201d ovens, like this new one from Dacor, which can microwave, cook with steam, or convection (circulating air)\u2014a whole new category to get confused by, but I hear they make fantastic casseroles.Toast With the Most1971: Toasters were improving, inch by inch. The new four-slot Toastmaster had separate \u201chis and hers\u201d controls to solve a marriage spat I never knew existed. It featured extra-large vertical slots for your all-day toasting needs (the ad shows a toaster-size pizza going in at 6 p.m. ...worrisome).Today: Revolution\u2019s touchscreen \u201csmart toaster\u201d makes toast so perfect you\u2019d think they\u2019re 3D printing it.Photo Courtesy Getty Images / H. Armstrong Roberts / Classicstock\u00a0Double the Oven1971: In the \u201cluxury class,\u201d according to a survey in Ladies\u2019 Home Journal, a kitchen would have two built-in ovens (a roast in one, a pie in the other). The \u201cmost-wanted\u201d feature in an oven was self-cleaning, which was new technology coveted by the universal advertiser\u2019s archetype: the housewife. (She hates cleaning! Free her from this tyranny!) \u201cSmooth-top\u201d electric ranges were \u201ca snap to clean\u201d and \u201ca great spot for a party buffet\u201d that appealed to both the environmentally conscious and lovers of tepid Swiss cheese pie.Photo Courtesy www.subzero-wolf.com\u00a0Today: You can top a sleek Wolf built-in oven with the new combo steam-and-convection oven, which detects the weight of what\u2019s inside to adjust cook time. The built-in oven connects to your Wi-Fi and comes with an app that lets you preheat from the couch. Progress!Iced Out1971: What a luxury it was to have a new Sears Coldspot fridge with a built-in ice maker in 1971 (\u201cI won\u2019t run out of ice in the middle of a party,\u201d says a happy husband whose freezer is otherwise packed with peas in an ad), or Amana\u2019s 5-Zone fridge with a temperature-controlled \u201cbutter conditioner.\u201d You could also get your fridge in wood-paneling to match your counters.Today: The most popular fridge is a mammoth \u201cFrench-door\u201d style, with the freezer on the bottom. Recent models from LG make cubed, crushed, and Craft Ice\u2122, perfectly spherical cocktail ice. To condition your butter, I dunno, just leave it on the counter. And while it doesn\u2019t come in wood-paneling, True Residential\u2019s line of luxury fridges does come in a range of bold colors to match your decor, including its newest shade, a moody blue-gray called Juniper.Photo Courtesy Smithsonian Institution / National Museum of American HistoryLife Comes at You Slow1971: Rival introduced the Crock-Pot in 1971. It came in eye-catching colors like avocado, of course, and \u201cdeluxe wood tone.\u201d In The New Yorker, Janet Malcolm noted: \u201cEverything you put in the Crock-Pot takes not minutes but forever to cook.\u201dPhoto Courtesy Instant-PotToday: The Instant Pot has usurped its place on our counters.Can Do1971: Westinghouse\u2019s new Sesame electric can opener removed lids without shaving metal flecks into your soup, and it came in gold or avocado, of course.Today: In a plot twist, we\u2019ve gone back to analog: hand-crank can openers like Oxo\u2019s that take up a lot less space.Coffee Station1971: Automatic electric percolators like Mirro-Matic\u2019s Cup-a-Minit (available in avocado green and harvest gold) were everywhere, but electric coffee grinders were new and marketed at the \u201cincreasing number of gourmets,\u201d per the New York Times.Today: Imagine what these \u201cgourmets\u201d would say if they knew what coffee snobs of the future would be raving about: the Chemex, a manual, pour-over vessel invented back in 1941.Do-It-All Dishwashers1971: Dishwashers were improving, like KitchenAid\u2019s latest model, which had a more powerful motor, a SaniCycle, and mediocre \u201cair-drying\u201d capabilities. Some came with \u201cchopping block tops\u201d\u2014a built-in cutting board\u2014for multitasking.Today: Dishwasher technology is now so advanced it\u2019ll do your math homework while it dries the dishes in record speed, though you\u2019ll pay for the luxury\u2014see Thermador Sapphire\u2019s StarDry for reference.Ambitious Blenders1971: Ronson\u2019s Cook\u2019n\u2019Stir was a blender that did blender things, plus it had a heating component so you could blend and heat a soup all at once. It never quite took off. Ronson also made the Foodmatic, a big $295 \u201cconsole\u201d that was a blender, mixer, knife sharpener, juicer, meat grinder, shredder, slicer, and overall space-taker-upper.Today: Instant Pot reinvented the Cook\u2019n\u2019Stir in 2018 with its Ace blender, which makes watery ice cream and seems to have met a similar fate. Meanwhile, the German-made $1,500 Thermomix, which blends, weighs, stirs, and simmers, has stood the test of time since its 1960s debut and still has a cult following.Explore Bon App\u00e9titDesignRecipes you want to make.
