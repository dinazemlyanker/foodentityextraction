You\u2019ll wish Caf\u00e9 Medina was in your hometown.ORDER THE: fricass\u00e9e, a.k.a. saucy short ribs (a Medina favorite), and the flavor-bomb harissa \u201cburger,\u201d a spiced meat-stuffed pita with two eggs, Parm, many garlicky sauces, and seasonal greens. Every table finishes the meal with a few waffles and dipping sauces\u2014the white chocolate-rosewater-pistachio is a classic.THE VIBE IS: meaty and lemony. The sunny space is filled with aromas of long-simmering stews and preserved lemons, and you\u2019ll find fresh-faced nicely coiffed friends waiting patiently in line. In other words, this is not a place for those with bad hangovers in need of cheap bacon. If you\u2019re in need, order one of Caf\u00e9 Medina\u2019s famous lavender lattes (available until late afternoon) to hold you over.PRACTICAL STUFF: Open every day: Monday to Friday, from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m.; and Saturday and Sunday, from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. No reservations. Can\u2019t wait? At the very least, ask for a coffee and a waffle to go.\u2014Lindsay AndersonAmy HoWE ALSO LOVEAlibi RoomVancouver\u2019s original craft beer bar in a quiet corner of GastownThe Pie ShoppeEast Vancouver\u2019s beloved, scrappy, and downright delicious bakeryChambarCivilized debauchery for breakfast, lunch, and dinner in CrosstownExplore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
