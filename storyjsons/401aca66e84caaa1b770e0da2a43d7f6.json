I love paneer, and I love green beans. And I love grilling those things. But the vinaigrette just wasn't punchy enough to carry the dish as the primary flavor component. Everything pretty much just tasted like garlic powder. And unfortunately, the recipe has you make way more spice rub than you need, so I just wasted a ton of spices on a blend that's going to sit in the back of my spice cabinet for years. Search the recipe \"paneer with burst cherry tomato sauce\" on BA and replace the peas with green beans\u2014so much better than this one!lasagnaqueenPortland, Oregon9/15/2021Step 3:\nSprinkle with 1 Tbsp. plus 1\u00bd tsp. spice rub and toss again to coat.\nWhat is the 1 Tbsp.?
