Here are several ways to help your favorite restaurants\u2014and their staff\u2014get through this unprecedented time, updated frequently.\u00a0By MacKenzie Chung FeganSeptember 30, 2020FacebookTwitterEmailEmpty streets, restaurants and cafes make up the business area in the one mile containment zone on March 11, 2020 in New Rochelle, New York.Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty ImagesFacebookTwitterEmailEditor\u2019s note: This page is being updated regularly to reflect new opportunities to support or get involved.We spend a lot of time writing about, thinking about, and, of course, eating at restaurants. So, as city and state governments impose curfews, limit the capacities of establishments, and close bars and restaurants entirely, we\u2019re asking a lot questions: Will the restaurants we know and love be able to reopen in a post-COVID-19 world? How will the cooks, servers, bussers, and bartenders who staff those restaurants make it through the coming weeks and months with no income?The people who have fed us when we\u2019ve needed comfort, popped bottles for us when we\u2019ve had cause to celebrate, and brought pizza to our doorstep every other night of the week need relief\u2014 and fast. So we\u2019ve put together this list of resources for anyone who wants to support restaurants, bars, and their staff during this unprecedented time. We want to be clear\u2014it will take more than buying a T-shirt to save the restaurant industry. Whether or not you have the resources to make a donation or buy a gift card, contact your elected officials and tell them not to forget about the restaurant industry. Here\u2019s what else you can do to help:Donate to an Existing NonprofitIf you want to support service workers whose livelihoods have been disrupted, there are several existing organizations\u2014both regional and national\u2014that provide aid to those in the restaurant industry. Many of these nonprofits have set up specific COVID-19 funds, and they have infrastructure and administration already in place.Restaurant Workers\u2019 Community Foundation COVID-19 Emergency Relief Fund (national)One Fair Wage (California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, New Jersey, New York, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Washington, D.C.)Big Table (Seattle, Spokane, and San Diego)Restaurant Association of Metropolitan Washington Educated Eats / Hook Hall Helps (D.C.)Southern Smoke Emergency Relief Program (Houston)The Giving Kitchen (Georgia)The LEE Initiative (Louisville)The James Beard Foundation Relief Fund (national)The United States Bartenders\u2019 Guild COVID-19 Relief Campaign (national)CORE: Children of Restaurant Employees (national)TX Restaurant Relief Fund (Texas)Colorado Restaurant Association Angel Relief Fund (Colorado)Restaurants Care (California)Golden Rule Charity (national)Detroit People\u2019s Food Co-op (Detroit)Heart of a Dinner (New York City)New philanthropic cookbooks from Serving New York (left) and Family Meal (right)\nServing New York Illustration by Jordan Awan, Family Meal Illustration by Pete GamlenBuy a Recipe or a T-Shirt or a...Artists, spirits brands, and other companies are collaborating with individual restaurants to create a litany of products with proceeds benefitting relief funds.inHouse at Home Serving New York Cookbook: 48 pantry-friendly recipes from New York restaurants with proceeds going to ROAR x Robin Hood Foundation\u2019s restaurant worker relief fund.Family Meal Recipes: Help one (or more!) of your favorite restaurants by downloading a recipe from this beautiful digital collection featuring designs from different illustrators.Buy This T-Shirt: Custom merch with sales benefitting restaurant partners.Merch Aid: Limited-edition tote bags and T-shirt tributes to small businesses (including many restaurants), each designed by a different artist.Feed Frontline Workers While Supporting RestaurantsMany hospital cafeterias are closed, and health care workers are too slammed to figure out how they\u2019re getting their next healthy, sustaining meal. Donate to an organization that connects restaurants to hospitals\u2014frontline workers get fed, and restaurants stay in business.Frontline FoodsWorld Central Kitchen #ChefsForAmericaFrontline Food TrucksJunzi\u2019s Share a Meal programBuy Merch!This is a great time to show your support for your favorite restaurant, bar, or coffee shop by buying some merch. If you\u2019ve been wearing the same ratty shirt for five days in a row, switch it up with this tee featuring Prince astride a Luck Dragon. Maybe you need a new tote bag to carry your belongings from one room of your apartment to the other room of your apartment. Wear this Dad hat to your next Zoom meeting and your boss need never know that you\u2019re not wearing pants. Paint your nails Cafe Roze pink and remember that outside, it\u2019s nearly spring!

Show your favorite restaurants some love now and cash in later when we\u2019ll all be relearning how to dine in public. Give restaurant gift cards to all your friends with spring birthdays in the hopes that they\u2019ll eventually take you out to dinner! If you don\u2019t see the option to purchase a gift card on your fave restaurant\u2019s website, slide into their DMs and demand they take your money.Restaurants participating in the Dining Bonds Initiative are offering gift certificates that work like a savings bond. You buy a bond for less than the face value, redeemable at some point in the future.Rally for Restaurants is a campaign to encourage diners to buy gift cards, and it will donate one dollar for every social media post to the Restaurant Workers\u2019 Community Foundation and World Central Kitchen.Take ActionEvery gift card helps, but what the restaurant workers and the hospitality industry really need is the kind of large-scale relief that can only come from the government. A movement is starting to build across the country to agitate for everything from stimulus packages to rent forgiveness. A few emerging coalitions and activist organizations are below, but you can also contact your elected representatives directly and tell them that restaurants and their employees need help as much as the airlines and large corporations.America\u2019s TableIndependent Restaurant CoalitionNew York Hospitality CoalitionAmerican Chefs PetitionDonate to a Relief FundDozens of ad hoc coalitions and relief funds have sprung up to address the immediate needs of workers in specific cities and regions. These efforts range from GoFundMe pages with in-depth descriptions of how funds will be distributed to spreadsheets with Venmo usernames of restaurant workers in need. Some of these more informal fundraising networks are partnering with larger organizations\u2014including ones mentioned above\u2014to disburse funds while some are creating their own models.Relief Opportunities for All Restaurants (ROAR)Restaurant Strong FundSonoma Family Meal Restaurant Network ResponseCharlottesville Restaurant Community FundService Workers\u2019 Coalition (Brooklyn)Seattle Hospitality Emergency FundStock\u2014which is also selling shirts (Chicago)Ohio Service Industry COVID-19 ReliefCOVID-19 Rhode Island Hospitality Relief FundBoston Area COVID-19 Restaurant Emergency FundLeveler.info (national, mobile access only)Eko Kitchen (San Francisco)Longevity Fund (New York City)Photo by Visual China Group via Getty Images/Visual China Group via Getty ImagesReach Out DirectlyMany small family-owned restaurants have neither merch nor digital gift cards to sell, and they might not be in the extended networks of the organizers of GoFundMe campaigns. How do we help the most vulnerable workers at, say, shuttered restaurants in Chinatown? Kevin Finch, the executive director of Big Table, recommends contacting the manager or owner of a favorite neighborhood restaurant and asking, \u201cWho on your staff is most in need? Can I help that one person?\u201d Finch says, \u201cIf you\u2019re trying to make sure the most vulnerable don\u2019t slip through the cracks, it\u2019s not rocket science. It\u2019s old-fashioned connection, person to person.\u201dExplore Bon App\u00e9titCoronavirusRestaurantsRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
