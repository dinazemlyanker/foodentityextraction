Pro tip: If you sign up for the newsletter, you'll get the scoop before everyone else.Dear Healthyish friends,While summer has never been my season (too sweaty!), summer food has always been some of my favorite. And so I\u2019m sliding into Memorial Day weekend feeling bittersweet, thinking of all the cookout hot dogs, park picnics, and beach hoagies I won\u2019t be enjoying with friends this year. I\u2019ve made halfhearted plans to try to bike to the beach by myself over the long weekend, but I\u2019m not sure what I\u2019ll do once I get there. Wave to it?One saving grace for me right now is that my apartment has ample porch space for me to safely, distantly host one or two visitors at a time. My building has a small, concrete walkway where my roommates and I have started setting out a rotting old bench we found as seating \u201cfor company.\u201d Once or twice a week, we have a friend over, usually to open a bottle of wine to mark the end of a long day.With the wine, there are always snacks. When we first started hosting these impromptu stoop hangs, I didn\u2019t set out anything too elaborate: a handful of crackers and some olives and a wedge of cheese were novel enough to make it feel special. But now that we\u2019re a few weeks into hosting mode, I\u2019ve slowly upped the ante on my porch spreads. I\u2019ve now graduated to full-on meals, which I bring downstairs on a half-sheet tray with plates, napkins, glasses\u2014basically everything but the tablecloth (though that might be my next step).It's definitely chicken salad season.\nPhoto by Emma Fishman, Plate by Meilen Ceramics\u00a0One recent such stoop meal featured this brand-new Healthyish Chicken Salad, which is the kind of chicken salad I can eat a big plate of in 80-degree weather and feel great afterward. If you\u2019ve never gently poached a chicken breast in salted water until the meat is juicy and pull-apart tender, let this be the recipe that gets you there. (Although rotisserie or roast chicken would be great here, too.) Crunchy lettuce and cucumber planks keep things super refreshing, scallions add gentle bite, and a crunchy-creamy sesame dressing inspired by Japanese gomae adds texture and richness to every bite.I made this for my roommate Emma and our friend Belle on one of the first super-hot days of the season, along with iced black sesame milk lattes (from one of my favorite cookbooks, Amy Chaplin\u2019s Whole Food Cooking Every Day). We hung up our masks and ate and drank and talked for hours, and it was so joyous as to feel almost...normal. In the absence of regularly scheduled summer programming, I, like everyone else, am trying to figure out how to socialize in quarantine right now. I\u2019ve written about it here before, but Rachel Khong\u2019s essay about opening a pretend restaurant in her kitchen is inspiring me to think of other little touches I can add to bring our little porch set to life. On my list so far: a Bluetooth speaker, candles, paper umbrellas for pi\u00f1a season. I suppose there\u2019s no rush, though. I have all summer to figure it out.Waving from my stoop,Christina ChaeyAssociate editorGet the recipe:Healthyish Chicken SaladThis is the summery chicken salad you could eat plate after plate of without feeling like you\u2019ve downed a jar of mayonnaise\u2014because you didn't! Tender poached chicken breast, crisp greens, cukes, and scallions get tossed with a gomae-inspired dressing, with pops of crunch from sesame seeds and the creamy nuttiness of tahini in every bite.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titWhat's Chaey Cooking?HealthyishChicken SaladRead MoreLifestyleMy Pantry Spreadsheet Is Bringing Me So Much Joy Right NowBy Christina ChaeyRecipes you want to make.
