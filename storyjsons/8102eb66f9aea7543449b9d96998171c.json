Pro tip: If you sign up for the newsletter, you'll get the scoop before everyone else.Healthyish friends,At the beginning of last week, BA staffers were working on a dinner party feature for the fall, sending writers on road trips, cooking and filming in the test kitchen, walking to Los Tacos No. 1 for lunch, and talking about our upcoming vacations.None of that is happening now. Instead, we\u2019ve all been working at a dizzying speed to make our site, including Healthyish and Basically, as helpful, comforting, and relevant as possible considering where we\u2019re at (home) and where you\u2019re at (also home, I hope).In case you\u2019re looking, we\u2019ve got SO many recipe galleries: Beans! Canned tomatoes! Tinned fish! We\u2019ve got encouragement for new home cooks. Eighty-nine(!) recipes that use only five ingredients. And all the comfort food our staff is making right now.Meanwhile, we\u2019ve been talking to people in the restaurant and food world pretty much nonstop about how their lives have been affected by coronavirus. The owner of Rancho Gordo beans, an indigenous chef in the Twin Cities, a D.C. caterer, and so many more are creating an important record of the industry at this unprecedented time.Want to help these restaurants and their staff right now? We\u2019ve put together a list of ways to do that, and we\u2019ll be rolling out more suggestions in the coming days, weeks, and months. Need to order coffee? We got you covered. How about wine? We\u2019re working on that too.Here at Healthyish, we\u2019ve got 17 ways to feel better while stuck at home and 6 ingredients we\u2019re doubling down on for mental and physical health. Remember chickpeas? Here are 29 healthyish recipes using them. Also did I mention Chris Morocco\u2019s new Creamy-ish of Mushroom Soup? Kind of nonsensical name, really amazing (and vegan) recipe.Photo by Emma Fishman, Food Styling by Pearl JonesFor my part, I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about how differently people respond to uncertainty and stress. For example, a lot of my co-workers\u2014and so many others\u2014are finding solace in cooking right now, whereas I\u2019ve had trouble mustering the energy to turn on my stove. It\u2019s a great irony, considering my recent dedication to #notmealprep, how little I want to cook now that I\u2019m \u201csupposed to.\u201d I never did like being told what to do.So what am I doing? Honestly, working\u2014because there\u2019s a lot to do, but also because it helps me feel productive, distracted, and like I\u2019m helping somehow. I\u2019m walking my dog and dancing in my sweatpants and calling the people I love. Wondering if I should order some free weights for the weeks and months ahead. Wondering whether it\u2019s a blessing or a curse to live alone right now. It feels like both, depending on the hour.Last night, I finally managed to roast a kabocha squash and saut\u00e9 a can of white beans for dinner. I did it \u201cwith\u201d two friends who FaceTimed me from their Williamsburg kitchen two miles away. We cooked and ate \u201ctogether,\u201d and I laughed more than I had in a week.We may be stuck inside, but we need to take care of each other more than ever right now. In our isolation, we need to think, more than ever, about community. We need to protect the most vulnerable among us\u2014from infection, yes, but also from loneliness, depression, and fear.I said it last week and I\u2019ll say it again: We\u2019re in this together, even if we\u2019re apart.Until next week,Amanda ShapiroHealthyish editorExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishSelf CareHealthyish NewsletterCoronavirusessayRead MoreLifestyleA Short List of Good ThingsBy Amanda ShapiroRecipes you want to make.
