What should your next move be? Do you trash them or try to salvage the neglected spuds? The question at hand: Can you eat sprouted potatoes? What about green, discolored, or otherwise ailing spuds?So can you eat sprouted potatoes?The short answer: It depends. When potatoes begin to sprout, the growths (those roots, eyes, and bumps) have a high concentration of compounds called glycoalkaloids that can cause a sharp, unpleasant, bitter taste. For most people you\u2019re not likely to see any ill effects from negligible amounts\u2014in fact, one of those compounds, called solanine, is the same compound that occurs naturally in eggplants, tomatoes, and peppers (a class of plants known as nightshades). In large quantities, however\u2014like in those roots and shoots popping up in the back of your pantry\u2014it can be toxic.If you\u2019ve got otherwise good-looking potatoes that have a few small sprouts, you can carefully remove them with a paring knife\u2014make sure to really get in there and cut around the sprouts, excising any roots, bumps, and eyes\u2014and go about your business. They\u2019ll be fine and just as tasty when you cook them (even if they aren\u2019t looking their best when they\u2019re raw).But if those spuds look like they\u2019ve grown arms and legs and are ready to put up a fight\u2014we\u2019re talking super-long roots, potato eyes that look like they\u2019re staring back at you, extensive growths that are reaching for the sun, it\u2019s probably best to toss them. Large sprouts, growths, and roots will not only be unpleasant to eat, but, in the worst cases, can also make you really sick. Symptoms of poisoning from solanine (the specific type of those harmful compounds found in spoiled potatoes) include everything from a fever and headache to a severely upset stomach.Okay, but what if they\u2019re green?Potatoes that have been exposed to light will begin to produce chlorophyll (green, harmless) as well as solanine. If the green color on your taters is light and mostly skin-deep, peel \u2019em well to remove the green parts and sally forth, but if they have any more color than that, you\u2019re better off pitching them.And what about those dark spots?If you peel potatoes and find a few dark or discolored spots on the flesh, don\u2019t sweat it\u2014this is likely the result of bruising during transport, or concentrations of natural sugars. Just cut those little spots out (they\u2019re not exactly cute) and proceed.In summary: It\u2019s likely not worth it to save a few spuds past their prime if they\u2019re sprouted and/or green. Play it safe and throw out or compost any potatoes that are severely blighted and save yourself\u2014and your stomach\u2014from a rough time.Explore Bon App\u00e9titcookingRecipes you want to make.
