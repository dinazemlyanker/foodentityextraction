By Brooklyn standards, it feels luxuriously large, like I could run a restaurant supply store out of the kitchen. As it turns out, all I really needed to change my tune was simply more square-footage: I\u2019m now the co-owner of, among other things, a food processor that I\u2019m surprised to find myself reaching for all the time. After a year of chopping, slicing, shredding, and pur\u00e9eing, I have some thoughts on whether you, too, should own a food processor.First, let\u2019s talk about what a food processor even is. At minimum, a basic food processor comes with a bowl, a removable lid, a base (which contains the motor), and a very sharp blade. It\u2019s more or less an extremely powerful knife that excels at quickly chopping and grinding tons of different ingredients, from onions to to nuts to hard cheeses, in a matter of seconds. The set of attachments will shred and slice carrots (carrot cake!), cabbage (slaw!), or potatoes (hash browns!). There are a whole host of fancy-pants attachments that can knead bread dough and juice vegetables and fold your laundry and pick up your children from school, but for the purposes of this article, I\u2019ll be talking about the no-frills basic kind.Homemade granola bars, thanks to your food processor.\nPhoto by Emma Fishman, Food Styling by Sue LiI\u2019m going to be upfront here: Unless you\u2019re the kind of cook who regularly makes your own homemade nut butters and energy balls, you don\u2019t absolutely need a food processor (I point out these two foods specifically because I\u2019m convinced you can\u2019t make them at home without one). However, if you do a lot of meal prep or you\u2019re chopping-averse, deathly afraid of sharp tools like mandolines and box graters, or uncertain about your knife skills, a food processor might be a worthwhile purchase to make cooking faster and generally more enjoyable.I find myself pulling out my food processor at least once a week to make my own hummus or bean dips, which I do frequently, as well as to whip together sauces and dips that are meant to have a bit of texture. Because most food processors come with a \u201cpulse\u201d feature that allows you to control how finely chopped up your ingredients get, they\u2019re excellent for making not-quite-smooth-in-a-good-way sauces like pesto (BA\u2019s Best) and other all-purpose green sauces, romesco, salsa, or nam prik, the chunky Thai chile dip. (Conversely, food processors are not great at achieving a uniformly smooth texture, so if you're primarily interested in making silky soups or smoothies and only have room for one appliance, a high-powered blender is the better bet.)You're going to need a food processor for cauliflower rice.\nPhoto by Stephen Kent Johnson, food styling by Rebecca Jurkevich, prop styling by Kalen KaminskiThere are a host of other foods I\u2019ll make less occasionally, but when I do, I\u2019m extremely thankful to have a food processor on hand to get the job done, as it does everything so much quicker than I could do by hand. Take Lauren Schaefer\u2019s Cauliflower Rice Pilaf, for example. Owning a food processor means I don\u2019t have to finely chop an entire head of cauliflower with my chef knife. And I can make falafel at home: First, I chop up the herbs, then I wipe out the bowl and add the soaked chickpeas. There\u2019s no need to dirty a cutting board or a knife.When I\u2019m in the mood to bake, my food processor effortlessly cuts cold butter into flour for flaky pie dough and tall, buttery biscuits. It finely crushes graham crackers for a press-in pie crust (hellooo, frozen margarita pie) and makes breadcrumbs\u2014coarse or fine, you choose\u2014for topping pastas or a bowl of brothy beans. And on the days when I make a couple of gallons of homemade kimchi, it\u2019s a godsend for finely chopping large quantities of garlic and ginger, which would take an eternity to mince by hand. Could I do all of these tasks without a food processor? Technically, yes\u2014but I\u2019d be a much slower (and grumpier) cook for it.A food processor will get you perfectly bitsy breadcrumbs, ideal for pasta.\nMichael Graydon & Nikole HerriottUltimately the most important question that should drive your decision to buy a food processor is: Will you use it? If you can honestly answer \u201cyes\u201d to that question, all that\u2019s left to consider is whether it\u2019s worth the valuable storage or counter space it will take up in your kitchen\u2014and, yeah, the money. A good food processor will last you a long time, but it\u2019s not cheap. (The Test Kitchen\u2019s preferred model, the Cuisinart 14-cup, retails for about $160.) If that\u2019s more than you\u2019re willing to spend (or if you\u2019re just looking to avoid hand-chopping the occasional onion or chile), a less-expensive mini food processor (like our favorite model) might be more up your alley, especially if you have a smaller kitchen.I know the time may come when I have to leave my palatial kitchen behind for a standard closet-sized one. But I\u2019m taking my food processor with me\u2014even if that means I have to store it in my bedroom.Cuisinart 14-Cup Food Processor$230 at AmazonExplore Bon App\u00e9titequipmentFood ProcessorShoppingRecipes you want to make.
