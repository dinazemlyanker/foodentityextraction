In 2019, the quote appeared in the introduction to John Berger\u2019s Landscapes, which I\u2019d finally found time to read in a zero-gravity lounge chair overlooking the sea. But it wasn\u2019t just any sea. The water was really water but not the salty kind, instead of a sandy bottom there was stainless steel flooring and, from the horizon, a gigantic canvas screen-printed with a photo of a blue sky rose up. Outside the dome, the sun had broken through clouds; inside, it filtered through a UV screen. I applied more sunscreen to my face. I considered taking a dip.An hour before, in a maze of punch-colored lockers, I located number seven-thousand-something and began shoving all signs of winter weather into it. Puffy coat, recently unwound scarf, thick socks, boots, and sweater all went in, but not before I removed a bikini and beach gear from my overnight bag. An hour outside of Berlin, Tropical Islands (T.I.) fills an airfield hanger originally built in 1938 for the Nazi Luftwaffe. The Red Army overtook the site in 1945 and the Soviet Air Force stayed until 1992. A Malaysian company purchased the hanger at a steep discount in 2003, after some kind of German cargo-blimp enterprise went bankrupt. T.I. opened a year later.T.I.'s sandy beaches, complete with lopsided palm trees.\nPhoto by Jenny Pe\u00f1asAt some point after I moved to Berlin in 2015, I learned of the gigantic and easily accessible bubble. Berlin\u2019s winters are cold, but what I find more difficult to endure are the endless string of gray days. T.I. seemed like a gigantic SAD lamp, a tropical Truman Show. I\u2019d wanted to go to, but when I solidified plans to move back to the U.S, my mission felt increasingly urgent. And that\u2019s how I ended up stripping down on a Thursday morning amongst families with young children, retirees, and a surprisingly large number of thirty-something couples.T.I. is a labyrinth of superlatives\u2014it\u2019s one of the largest self-supporting halls on the planet and features the world\u2019s largest indoor rainforest; T.I. is Europe\u2019s largest tropical island resort and has the continent\u2019s biggest wellness and spa complex; the park also holds the record for Germany\u2019s highest water slide tower. I learn that the Eiffel Tower could comfortably lie down inside T.I. without piercing its dome, that the sea is the size of three Olympic swimming pools, that there are 50,000 real plants and a number of exotic fish. The air temperature is kept in the high seventies, humidity hovered around 50 percent.By mid-morning, all the seafront beach chairs were overlaid with people or place-saving towels, so I checked out the upstairs sundeck. For such a large complex, the sandy beach was actually quite narrow, just a spit of sand ringing the wading pool in front of the sea. It reminded me of million-dollar Malibu beachfront homes where erosion has taken almost all of the sand, leaving behind just the idea of a beach. Still, I wasn\u2019t immune to the satisfaction of being in a bikini in the indoor-outdoor world while regular, old February raged on outside, and there was a particular joy in swiping sand from my ankles as I readjusted.The world's largest indoor rainforest, complete with flamingos.\nPhoto by Jenny Pe\u00f1asWhen the (real) sun disappeared behind a cloud, I figured I should keep exploring. I considered a chicken Caesar salad at the nearby restaurant Palm Beach but decided to go a bit further afield. In the jungle, I found butterflies in mesh tents slurping from orange and pineapple slices and thatched huts with educational placards hiding electric equipment. Nature sounds piped through speakers, but the hundreds of varieties of tropical fauna weren\u2019t plastic. I hope those aren\u2019t real, I thought, wincing as I wound around the pathways to get a better look at a bunch of flamingos.T.I.\u2019s geography is a whiplash-inducing, rapid-fire movement between countries, cultures, and centuries where numerous regionally specific attributes add up to a global nowhere. There is both a medieval castle and a traditional hut from Samoa; a Western town with an intentionally faded, old-school 7-Up ad painted on the wall and also the largest Balinese gate outside of Bali. Later I learn that T.I. commissioned local artisans and architects in Southeast Asia to design and fabricate the structures that were then imported to Germany.I couldn\u2019t tell whether other visitors were drawn to T.I. for the same reasons I was, namely that winter sucks and a tropical air hanger seemed like the strangest way to deal with it. But while there, it occurred to me that T.I. also offers an alternative for people priced out of international travel. And for families with small kids, the heated dome offers a level of logistical ease that\u2019s hard to beat. T.I. may be an approximation of a tropical vacation, but it\u2019s one without long flights or passport stress, where no child could ever claim to be bored and nothing is more than a two minute walk away.A snaking waterslide system overlooks a \"sea\" the size of three Olympic swimming pools.\nPhoto by Jenny Pe\u00f1asBut the faux-tropics didn\u2019t offer anything like the sunbaked warmth of the real tropics. Instead, the steady heat and lack of fresh air made me feel as if I were being slowly microwaved. Over lunch, I Googled things like \u201cHow long do flamingos live in captivity?\u201d and \u201cWhat do you call a group of flamingos?\u201d A flamboyance of flamingos can live up to fifty years in captivity, and T.I. added theirs only seven years ago. Meanwhile, I\u2019d been inside the dome for a few hours and was already craving an exit plan.Kids rode the waterslides in endless loops; couples walked around in matching robes or napped in sync. On the lazy river jet stream channel, I read the words \u201cMemento Mori\u201d tattooed in a scripty font between the shoulder blades of the man in front of me. I ate a frozen yogurt at Caf\u00e9 Borneo while an employee wearing a harness walked by. He was pulling a hot air balloon filled with guests.As the sun began to set, I suddenly realized that most of the light would go with it. Before my visit, I\u2019d imagined T.I. would simulate the long days by the equator.\nInstead, because most of the dome is opaque, it\u2019s darker inside T.I. on a sunny day than outside the dome, and when the sun goes down IRL, it also goes down inside the cavernous air hanger. But first, a faux sunset\u2014courtesy of magenta and orange stage lights\u2014that made the rock grotto lagoon pool look ripe for a Bachelorette taping.A man enjoys a hot air balloon ride, no shirt required.\nPhoto by Jenny Pe\u00f1asI could have played a round of mini golf in the fading light or booked a hot air balloon ride for the following day or even watched The Simpsons at the theater named after a form of Indonesian puppet theater. Instead I went to the fanciest restaurant, where TI\u2019s signature excess is best exemplified by a corn poulard dish that comes with corn on the cob and popcorn. Over a pretty good salmon teriyaki, I watched a hairy man wearing only a speedo get turned down when he requested a table. (Shirts were required, shoes were not.) It had been a long day of doing mostly things I really like\u2014laying around reading, swimming, eating\u2014but I didn\u2019t feel rested or rejuvenated. I felt restless.On my way to T.I., a twenty-four-hour vacation felt absurdly short. But in the bubble, time stretched and slowed. After dinner, I went to the sauna and spa complex, where there were crystals the size of kindergarteners and a gigantic stone elephant cribbed from an 8th century Indian temple. The flamingos hadn\u2019t moved, but mice scurried across the jungle trails. In the lagoon, kids drunk on being up past their bedtime shrieked and swam.Home sweet home, or something like it.\nPhoto by Jenny Pe\u00f1asI unzipped my tent, which looked like the ones I\u2019d seen a few weeks before when watching Fyre: The Greatest Party That Never Happened. Inside, the otherwise unremarkable heat became overwhelming. T.I. had largely emptied, but because the dome functions like a gigantic echo chamber it felt like I was camping inside a soccer stadium with a game going. Condensation pitter-pattered down on one corner of my tent from hundreds of feet above. Before I finally passed out, I heard the anguished cry of a single flamingo.I awoke at six when the babies in nearby tents did, and then again, at seven, when the heat became too much to bear. Exhausted and frazzled, I walked to breakfast. At the next table, a trio of kids excitedly debated where to start their day. It was nice to see how happy T.I. made them. But for me, sitting in the \u201copen air\u201d plaza beneath a completely sealed dome felt like waiting out a significant delay at the airport. Polishing off some bacon, I realized I actually wasn\u2019t beholden to air traffic controllers or freak storms. I could spend the twenty-four hours I\u2019d planned to, but I could also leave. With a spring in my step, I took the long way back to my tent, pausing for one last look at the sea. I felt happier than I had the entire stay. I could have gotten one of the most coveted beach chairs under a palm tree in the sand. Instead, I settled the bill I\u2019d racked up on my faceless money watch and breezed through the turnstile.Outside, the air was icy cold and the sky an aggressively nondescript grey. I\u2019d never been more excited for one of Berlin\u2019s classic winter days. Maybe that was the point, I realized, on my way back the city. I hated Tropical Islands, but the nearly 24-hour-endurance test had made Berlin\u2019s dreary winter seem enjoyable by comparison.The view from outside the bubble.\nPhoto by Jenny Pe\u00f1asTropical Islands By The Numbers1,200,000 people visited last year.\n40% of them stayed overnight with an average stay of 2 nights.\nDay ticket prices start at \u20ac33; an overnight stay in a tent starts at \u20ac150.\nThere are supposedly 10 flamingos in residence, but I only saw 9 during my stay.\nI emailed T.I. reps to see if there\u2019d been a death. A representative assured me they only  had a double digit count and said, \u201c[N]ow and then one of them tiptoes around to explore the rest of the hall.\u201d\nThere are 275,000 balls in the children\u2019s ball pit and I\u2019m sad to report that I missed something called the Space Hole at the water playground where \u201cguests slip into a funnel that slowly sucks them down.\u201d\nThe hall has 50,000 plants from 600 species and the work of 1 self-described \u201cpalace-slut\u201d who moved to Bali from Australia in the seventies, renounced his name (Michael White), and went on to become a world-renowned tropical landscape architect, designing both David Bowie\u2019s estate in Mustique and Tropical Islands\u2019 lagoon before his death in 2016.\nI lasted about 22 hours.One of the many structures T.I. commissioned from local artisans and architects in Southeast Asia, then imported to Germany.\nPhoto by Jenny Pe\u00f1asThe real locals.\nPhoto by Jenny Pe\u00f1asTwo of the many tropical fish that call T.I. home.\nPhoto by Jenny Pe\u00f1asThe reflection of passing clouds, refracted through the opaque dome.\nPhoto by Jenny Pe\u00f1asThe gauntlet.\nPhoto by Jenny Pe\u00f1asExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishGermanyRead MoreLifestyleI Tried 'Wellness Coworking' and It Made Me Feel Profoundly AloneBy Rachel Sugar Recipes you want to make.
