See our past recommendations here!Let\u2019s just get this out of the way: Most grocery store vinegars taste terrible. They\u2019re made from low-quality wine (or other alcohol), which gives them a flavor that\u2019s barely more nuanced than the chewing-on-metal taste of distilled vinegar.O-Med doesn\u2019t make vinegars that you would ever consider cleaning with. They're lush, like burying your nose in a platter of lavender and peaches, with the concentrated, fruity essence of a good glass of wine. The ros\u00e9 vinegar, made from the Spanish red grape Trepat, has a touch of sweetness softening its acidic bite and accentuating its florality. It's my favorite for year-round use. It\u2019s bright without being harsh, perfect for lifting a bowl of salad greens or waking up grains, beans, and vegetables. I use it whenever I might otherwise turn to lemon or lime but don\u2019t want obvious citrus flavor.For how good it is, this vinegar should be a lot more expensive. Miraculously it usually sells for around $12\u201314, a bit more than twice the price of those vinegars that are better suited to stripping paint. Think of it as investing in a bottle of wine that will last longer than any other ros\u00e9 you can buy.\u2014Chris Morocco, senior food editorBuy it: O-Med Ros\u00e9 Vinegar, $12.All products featured on Healthyish are independently selected by our editors.
