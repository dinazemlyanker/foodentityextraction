How to Mix Any Cocktail the Right WayThe way you mix matters.By Nico AvalleFebruary 4, 2022FacebookTwitterEmailPhotograph by Isa Zapata. Food Styling by Pearl Jones.

Sure, James Bond takes his drink of choice straight from the shaker, but (and I\u2019m sorry if this is controversial) James Bond is also a fictional character, not to mention a murderer. Should we really be taking his advice? I\u2019m skeptical.I\u2019ve been working on my bartending skills to save money on going out, and while there are lots of opinions in the world of booze, it\u2019s a straight-up fact that the way you mix a cocktail is really, really important. It can massively alter the taste and texture of your drink long before it\u2019s even in the glass. The difference between shaking and stirring may seem trivial, like just another step of a recipe to do with what you will, but mixing correctly is often the most important part of making a cocktail.Why does mixing matter?Mixing is obviously important for combining ingredients, but it\u2019s far from the only reason bartenders reach for their spoons and shakers. \u201cThere are two things we\u2019re trying to achieve whether we\u2019re shaking or stirring a cocktail,\u201d says Natasha David, cocktail consultant and author of the upcoming cookbook Drink Lightly. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to dilute the cocktail, and we\u2019re trying to chill the cocktail.\u201dDrink Lightly by Natasha David$27 at AmazonChilling the drink with ice makes sense, but diluting a drink on purpose may seem unexpected (and even like\u2026a rip-off?). But it\u2019s actually a good thing. According to David, the ice that melts during the mixing process helps bind the ingredients into a cohesive drink and softens the harsh taste of uncut liquor. Mixing in the right amount of ice-cold water is the difference between drinking two-plus shots of plain gin and drinking a cool, classy martini (give or take a couple of olives).So when should I shake vs. stir a cocktail?Shake it!\u201cThe general rule of thumb is that if a cocktail has citrus, egg, cream, or any opaque ingredient, then you shake it,\u201d David says. Essentially, that means shake when you\u2019re mixing booze with anything that isn\u2019t booze. A vigorous shake thoroughly combines alcoholic and nonalcoholic ingredients while quickly chilling a cocktail and incorporating air. The end result is a light and frothy drink that\u2019s uniform all the way to the last sip.Stir it!If a cocktail\u2019s ingredients are all liquor, you\u2019re better off stirring it. Think classics like martinis and negronis. The biggest source of flavor in these drinks is the booze itself, so you want to preserve their character during mixing. Gently stirring the drink with ice prevents over-diluting the cocktail and keeps aeration to a minimum. The result is a smooth sipping drink with a lush, velvety mouthfeel and the right amount of bite.Build it!The last category of drinks is built cocktails, which don\u2019t need stirring at all. These are mixed drinks like scotch and sodas or gin and tonics, along with many champagne and sparkling wine cocktails. \u201cYou have bubbles in there,\u201d David warns, \u201cso you don't want to flatten the drink by shaking them.\u201d By far the easiest category to make, simply pour over ice and serve as they are.What kind of shaker should I use?The two most popular shaker designs are the Boston shaker and cobbler shaker. Boston shakers are two tin cups (or a tin and a glass) slammed together to create a seal. They\u2019re incredibly lo-fi, but as a result, simple to use and even simpler to clean. Cobbler shakers, on the other hand, are a bit more high-tech. These bottle-shaped devices are what you probably picture when you imagine a cocktail shaker, and they come in three parts: a cup, a built-in strainer, and a cap to keep things from splattering while you shake.Cocktail Kingdom Boston Shaker SetNote: The top and bottom tins are sold separately.\n$12 at Amazon (Base)$11 at Amazon (Top)While both styles are the same in terms of function and almost certainly won\u2019t make a difference in the quality of the drinks you make, we tend to prefer the simplicity of Boston shakers. There are fewer pieces to keep up with and no nooks and crannies to clean, which makes scrubbing them out between rounds much faster. You will need a separate strainer (we like spring-loaded Hawthorne strainers for ease of use), but luckily those are nice and cheap.Hawthorne Strainer$7 at AmazonHow should I serve my cocktails?Some stirred cocktails\u2014like an old-fashioned\u2014are mixed and served in the same glass, ice and all. This creates a dynamic drink whose first sip is punchy while the last one is light. (To prevent over-diluting, you can use large ice cubes when stirring and serving these cocktails as they melt more slowly.)Pretty much all other cocktails, shaken or stirred, are strained into a separate vessel before serving. Cocktails served \u201con the rocks\u201d are poured from the strainer over fresh ice to keep things chilly and refreshing\u2014ideal for bright drinks like margaritas, mai tais, and negronis. Cocktails served \u201cup\u201d or \u201cstraight up,\u201d on the other hand, come without ice and are classically strained into a stemmed coupe or martini glass. If you ever get confused, you can remind yourself that the tall, stemmed glass lifts the cocktail up off the bar. You\u2019ll often see shaken drinks like cosmos and stirred drinks like Manhattans served this way. While the glass won\u2019t make or break your drink, the stem will help keep your hands from heating things up in the absence of ice. Still, if you don\u2019t own martini glasses, it\u2019s not the end of the world. You\u2019ll just have to drink faster.Like most cooking \u201crules,\u201d you shouldn\u2019t take any of these tips as cocktail gospel. Making your own cocktails is about making drinks that are perfect for you. Once you know the basics, you can riff and experiment and tweak recipes to make the drinks you\u2019ve been dreaming of. Shaken or stirred, you can always just make another round.Explore Bon App\u00e9titcookingtechniqueCocktailRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
