But these peanut butter blondies are the truth.By Emma WartzmanSeptember 28, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Chelsie CraigFacebookTwitterEmailWelcome to Never Fail, a weekly column where we wax poetic about the recipes that never, ever let us down.I used to be naive. I used to think that no blondie recipe could ever hold a candle to a brownie, full stop. It\u2019s not that I would refuse a blondie if someone handed me one (I\u2019m not a monster), but if I ever felt like making a dessert in bar form, it would be brownies every time.That is, until I met this particular blondie recipe, which involves a ton of peanut butter and is therefore obviously superior, especially with the addition of chocolate chips. (Okay, those are not in the recipe, but I swapped them in for the roasted peanuts because everyone knows that peanut butter and chocolate go together like rainy days and sweatpants.)This blondie recipe calls for no fancy tools or equipment or ingredients, and is so simple that even a novice baker should have no problem putting it together. Here's how it goes. After buttering and flouring a baking dish, I melted some butter on the stove and then let it cool. While the butter was melting, I whisked together my dry ingredients\u2014flour, baking powder, and salt. That happened so quickly that I still had some time to kill before the butter got to room temperature, so I went ahead and prepped my wet ingredients, measuring out eggs, vanilla, peanut butter, and brown sugar. When the butter was cool enough to work with\u2014you don\u2019t want it to be too hot or it will cook the eggs\u2014I added the wet ingredients straight into the pan with the butter and whisked my heart out, followed by the dry ingredients, more whisking, and then those chocolate chips.That peanut butter is mouth-watering just to look at.\nPhoto by Alex LauAt this point, I poured the batter into my prepared pan, using a spatula to smooth things out. But that's not all! Claire Saffitz, who developed the recipe and is a genius when it comes to all things sweet, adds one extra step that ensures ultimate gooeyness. A combination of more melted butter, more peanut butter, and more sugar get poured over the top, which half combines with the batter to create a soft, peanut buttery layer in the finished blondies. It\u2019s an extra step, but one that is fully worth it.If you make these at home, a scoop of vanilla ice cream over the top is enough to make them dinner party-worthy. But I packed mine up in a container and brought some over to a friend\u2019s apartment, and then brought the remainder to work the next day, and got rave reviews pretty much as soon as I opened the Tupperware. I don\u2019t think anyone missed the ice cream.Get the recipe:Peanut Butter BlondiesOoey, gooey, peanut butter-y perfection.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titPeanut ButterDessertBasicallyNever FailRead MorecookingThis Easy Sheet Cake Recipe Doesn't Seem Like It Should Work, but It's IncredibleBy Claire SaffitzRecipes you want to make.
