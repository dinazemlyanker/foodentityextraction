Butternut squash season starts in early fall. Look for very firm and heavy squash with fresh-looking stems. The skin should be smooth and unblemished. Size doesn\u2019t make a difference in flavor, but squash with long necks are generally easier to peel and break down.IngredientsMakes 1 dozen2large eggs10Tbsp. unsalted butter, melted\u2154cup buttermilk2tsp. grated peeled ginger (from one 2\" piece)\u2154cup plus 2 Tbsp.

I followed the suggestion to add in some crystallized ginger (about 1/4 cup); I also substituted about 1/3 cup of grated carrot for some of the squash because I turned out not to have quite enough squash, and substituted apple sauce for half of the melted butter. I cooked them about 36 minutes because the batter is indeed quite moist. The results are very good.Brooklyn MomBrooklyn, NY12/29/2021These were tasty but very dense and not as interesting as I'd expected given the squash and coconut.Liz12/1/2021These are delicious. The fresh ginger and coconut combo are such a nice change from other muffins. I used a different squash (Zucchino Rampicante, cured for winter) and subbed out half of the butter for coconut oil. Made 16 muffins, and will definitely make again.BethPleasanton, CA11/16/2021These are so delicious!! Super moist and not too sweet, and very easy to make. Definitely recommend following the other commenters\u2019 advice and throwing the squash in the food processor instead of grating it. I cut a portion of my squash into ~1\u201d chunks and then processed them until they were finely chopped. So much easier than grating and I like the distribution you get in the muffins. Next time I might lightly toast the pecans just to get a nicer flavor out of them. The only issue I had was that the muffins stuck to the paper liners, so I might also try just spraying the muffin pan instead of using liners next time.SoapnanaChicago, IL1/10/2021These were so yummy! I also used a food processor like some people recommended. Didn't have pecans but used walnuts, and added dates. Also added some maple syrup for taste and texture as well as a bit more buttermilk, and had enough batter for 16. Did 1/2 brown sugar, 1/2 coconut sugar. Forgot to add brown sugar on top but made a coconut curry frosting which was yummy!Brenda11/16/202010 Tbsp of saturated fat. AnonymousDenver, CO11/13/2020What would the recipe look like for gluten free?|\nCandia, NH4/11/2020I made my own version of these.  Added 1 c. grated apple, 1 c. grated zucchini, 3/4 c. raisins, and 3/4 c. candied ginger chips to recipe.  Didn't change anything else.  Made 2 dozen muffins.  Delicious.drfoheadPhiladelphia10/26/2019Is there anyway to cut the fat down in this recipe?  Ten tbs of butter is almost one per muffin.cfranceFrance and Florida10/18/2019I made these because I had coconut flakes and squash left over from another recipe and was very surprised at how delicious they are! The flavors are very subtle and not at all over powering. The texture is dense but perfect. Like other reviewers I used a food processor to make the squash pieces much smaller than a box grater (plus it was way easier than shredding by hand). Only about 1/4 of a good sized squash is needed. I will be making these again!AnonymousNew York10/25/2018My family loved these muffins. I thought the flavors were perfectly balanced and the coconut provided a wonderful aroma and toothsome quality.  These are especially good if you don't like overly sweet baked goods for breakfast. I foresee making these often. Linda SSan Francisco, California10/21/2018It's not a bad muffin, but not a memorable one. This is supposed to be another take on the \"morning glory\" muffin, which uses carrots and this one uses squash because it's fall now, I think. Carrots and the butternut squash have subtle flavors when they have to compete with brown sugar. I'm not sure when I won't find carrots at my grocery store, so for that reason I can't see the point in using the squash unless I feel seasonally festive and want to deal with a more difficult food than peeling and shredding a carrot. And they both seem to have the same texture. Additionally, I don't see how the coconut flakes contribute other than texture-wise. To be honest, if I just added more squash instead of the coconut I wouldn't have noticed a difference.  Unfortunately, this is not a keeper. Anonymousminnesota10/16/2018This recipe is so wonderful, but I want others to know of some necessary adjustments. Throw the butternut squash in your food processor or Vitamix. Having a finer mince on the squash contributes to a dense yet delicate crumb. Also, the brown sugar measurement should note that the additional 2 tablespoons should be separated\u200b for topping. The instructions said to just add the brown sugar to the wet mixture, not indicating that some should be for topping.  The flavor is so balanced, unusual, with a PERFECT crumb. Moist, dense, yet not heavy. This recipe actually made more than a dozen for me, but NO COMPLAINTS! angie.stefanecDenver10/15/2018So easy and delicious, these muffins got raves all around. Making a second batch now! 1/4 of a butternut squash is the perfect amount. AnonymousSan Diego10/14/20189oz seemed like way more than 2c of butternut squash.  would stick to volume measurement.  also might recommend food processor for very shredded squash vs. box grater for nicer texture.  we found the squash a bit too intact but the flavors were very nice.Anonymousdenver10/10/2018Explore Bon App\u00e9titMuffinPastriesDessertAmericanButternut SquashSquashVegetableButtermilkOther IngredientsGingerHerbs & SpicesCoconutFruitFallBakingBreakfastRecipes you want to make.
