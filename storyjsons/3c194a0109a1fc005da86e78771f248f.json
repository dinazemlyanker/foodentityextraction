Next up is Meymuna Hussein-Cattan, who runs the Tiyya Foundation and sister restaurant Flavors From Afar.Tender lamb shanks melt into an Egyptian gravy, soaking the accompanying fluffy rice pilaf. This is one of the most popular entr\u00e9es at Flavors From Afar, a sunlit restaurant in the Fairfax district of Hollywood opened by Meymuna Hussein-Cattan and cofounder Christian Davis in March of 2020.Alongside a staple menu of customer favorites, each month Hussein-Cattan taps a new chef who is a refugee or asylum seeker to share their culture via home-cooked meals\u2014like Chechen manti dumplings, Lebanese ouze, and Kenyan coconut tilapia. This ensures a diversity of cuisine hard to find in many other restaurants. Most chefs are discovered through the Tiyya Foundation, a nonprofit Hussein-Cattan started with her mother, Owliya Dima, in 2010 to support families of refugees, immigrants, and displaced Indigenous communities. The relationship is self-sustaining: 40 percent of profits generated by Flavors From Afar goes towards Tiyya\u2019s programming.\u201cWhat I want to do is create a peer-to-peer dialogue,\u201d explains Hussein-Cattan. As an East African refugee who moved to the U.S. in 1984, she knows firsthand how food can be an entry point for cultural exchange and a way to highlight talent over trauma. \u201cI think our stories should be held in care,\u201d she says. \u201cAt the start our audience was intrigued by my mother's experience as a refugee\u2014her reasons for fleeing Ethiopia, life in the refugee camp, her transition into America. I wish she was empowered to lead instead with her favorite foods, music, and passion for gardening. [Because], ultimately, she became triggered by her past.\u201dA year and a half after their launch, Flavors From Afar is still cooking. I sat down with Hussein-Cattan to chat about how her experiences as a refugee have shaped her career, why centering joy is important, and her favorite lazy meal on a night off.My parents fled\u2026 Ethiopia in the \u201970s and I was born in a refugee camp in Somalia. I started the Tiyya Foundation in the U.S. with my mother to support refugee families because we knew how difficult it is to transition into a new country. Most of my upbringing was just watching my parents figure out how to navigate their lives here. However, we hit a wall in 2012 because being active in the non-profit triggered my mother\u2019s PTSD due to the repeated retelling of her refugee experience. Many elders from Ethiopia seldom speak about the violence they witnessed. For my mom specifically, retelling her story brought up vivid memories that were unprocessed. After my mom left the foundation, I had faith [in our cause] and the right people showed up to help.In my experience, refugees are\u2026 like alchemists. They\u2019re able to create something out of nothing after losing everything. We\u2019re celebrating them for their gifts and talent as culinary artists\u2014and amplifying immigrant women as the originators of these dishes\u2014and that feels good to me. We introduce dishes that they make at home for their children. These aren\u2019t recipes that you find everywhere; they\u2019re not typically accessible in the American mainstream.As a Black, African, female refugee... I\u2019ve experienced the repercussions of an immigration conversation that is othering. I think [tourists to the U.S.] are treated with higher regard than migrants, who actually bring more long-term value to a new country. Migrants stay, create new businesses, and pay taxes. Displacement is the real problem. It\u2019s the direct outcome of wars, lack of resources, fear of government; it\u2019s fleeing by force. Then, once someone arrives in a new country, they have to deal with language barriers, social isolation, cultural nuances, and discrimination.I had a lot of imposter syndrome\u2026 opening Flavors From Afar. All these other restauranteurs in Los Angeles\u2014who are seasoned and at the top of their game\u2014were forced to consider closing their doors when the pandemic hit. Yet I walked in with the audacity to open my doors. We opened the same week as the stay-at-home orders, and not just as a trial run. We opened for real, intending to stick with it for the long haul. I overcame my insecurities by acknowledging all of my transferable skills from the nonprofit sector. I know how to host fundraising banquets, create [social impact] programs, and lead evaluations. I nurtured these traits and trusted myself.I am the taste tester\u2026 at Flavors From Afar, not a chef. But I grew up learning to appreciate traditional recipes like injera, doro wat, tibs, and dabo sweet bread. Because my mother spent many formative years in Somalia, my family also grew up with biryani rice, sambusa, and chai in the home. I\u2019m not the most fantastic chef, but I appreciated learning her recipes growing up. It\u2019s something I can pass on to my own daughter.If I want a night off from cooking\u2026 I\u2019ll go to Del Taco for their chicken soft tacos. It\u2019s been my vice since high school\u2014my go-to comfort food. Otherwise I\u2019m all about the ambience of a place. I love the L.A. skyline, so I look for rooftop [bars and restaurants]. My favorite is Perch because the food doesn\u2019t disappoint and the drinks are good. But I\u2019m easy; as long as I have a nice view I\u2019m good.The Ethiopian food I miss the most\u2026 is my mom\u2019s home cooking. My parents live in Seattle now, and I only get to see them about twice a year\u2014although we call and Facetime almost every day. I love the breakfast that she makes: her ful medames with Ethiopian spices and her sambusa with her secret blends.When you dine at Flavors From Afar\u2026 there\u2019s an element of respect and reverence towards the refugees. There\u2019s something about eating good food and knowing that the money is going back to a good cause. You\u2019re nourished, but your heart also feels full.Explore Bon App\u00e9titPerson of InterestRestaurantsRead MorecultureHey, It's Your Korean DadBy Bettina MakalintalcultureThis Twitter Tarot Reader Finds Mental Health Wisdom in the CardsBy Joseph HernandezLifestyleAlexis Nikole Nelson Is Making #ForagerTikTok Our Favorite Place to BeBy DennyRecipes you want to make.
