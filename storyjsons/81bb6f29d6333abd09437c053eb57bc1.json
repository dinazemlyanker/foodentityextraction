In middle school I saw a nutritionist; in highschool, I tried Weight Watchers; when I was 17, I bought Adderall off a classmate to suppress my appetite during the day, only to binge on \u201cCookie Cereal\u201d (literally chocolate chip cookies in milk) at night; and when I worked in restaurants, an average shift would include snacks all night and end with a 2 a.m. burger, salad, and skillet cookie.Then I discovered Whole30. It drew me in with the rigidity. The hard and fast rules. The promise that \u201cThis is not a diet! It\u2019s a reset!\u201d The day I began Whole30, I got out of bed, used eyeliner to draw a 30-day countdown on my mirror along with some inspirational \u201cYou got this!\u201d language, and carefully planned my upcoming meals. The thing about diets is that the first day is the best day. All the promise of control, the body you want, and the high of \u201ca plan\u201d giving you a false but very comforting sense of security.The 30-day eating plan that founder Melissa Urban urges is \u201cnot a diet\u201d was strict, harsh, and for me, miraculous.Fifteen days into the program, I felt like a new person. I was lighter and more energized, I slept soundly, and I was much more mindful of what I was eating each day. But when the 30 days were up, I binged like it was Christmas morning (or Yom Kippur Break-Fast, in my case).I did Whole30 five or six times. Each time, within a day or two of finishing, I felt like a total failure.A year later, when I started my eating psychology coaching practice, I realized I wasn\u2019t alone. A common unspoken side effect of the \u201cmiraculous\u201d Whole30 is that it often ends\u2014either by day 31 or way sooner\u2014with bingeing. Eight out of nine of my clients who identified as having weight and health issues told me they\u2019d experienced heavy binges after the 30 days were up.Turns out that, regardless of whether you call it a diet or a detox or a reset, controlling your food with rigid rules just doesn\u2019t work if your goal is to lose weight.Recent studies show that there is no evidence that weight loss programs help people to lose weight in the long term. The rate of failure, defined as either gaining weight or not losing weight, is around 95 percent (some say higher), and attempting weight loss is actually a strong predictor of weight gain. In other words, the more you try to drop pounds, the more likely you are to gain them.Not only does dieting lead to weight gain, it\u2019s also a common precursor to eating disorders, especially in young women. In a study done in 1991 over the course of three years, 14-year-old girls who dieted at a \u201csevere level\u201d were 18 times more likely to develop an eating disorder than those who didn\u2019t. And those who dieted at a \u201cmoderate level\u201d were five times more likely to develop an eating disorder.Many proponents of paleo, keto, or Whole30 will say ad nauseam that these are lifestyles, not diets, but if an individual engages in these eating habits with a dieting or weight-control mindset, they do in fact become diets. Whole30 founder Melissa Urban may not be trying to lose weight, but the reality is that most of us attempting to manipulate our food, especially women, are doing so with a desire to alter our appearance, often through weight.Isabel Foxen Duke, a diet recovery coach and creator of the Stop Fighting Food movement, believes that bingeing is a direct and inevitable outcome of restriction and real or perceived deprivation. That means that whether you\u2019re eating the pizza or not, if you\u2019re harboring guilt about it, chances are you\u2019re going to find yourself bingeing. In fact, Foxen Duke renamed the term bingeing as \u201creactionary eating,\u201d noting, in her Stop Fighting Food Masterclass,  that binges always happen in reaction to diet culture.Through my work as an eating psychology coach, I\u2019ve seen that we can\u2019t undo the cycle of dieting and weight gain until we understand what\u2019s underlying our constant desire to drop pounds. At its core, dieting is a coping mechanism, and not a healthy one. We\u2019re not born wanting to change our bodies, but billions of dollars are spent telling us that we should.I\u2019ve come to believe that, to end the diet-binge cycle, there has to be an inherent acceptance of the bodies we\u2019re in. We don\u2019t have to love it, but we can start with accepting it. Geneen Roth, who\u2019s written numerous books about body image and dieting, says in her book, Women, Food and God, \"If you try to lose weight by shaming, depriving and fearing yourself, you will end up shamed, deprived, and afraid. Kindness comes first. Always.\"Stress messes with our body\u2019s ability to tell us when we\u2019re hungry and when we\u2019re full, so the more we worry about diet and weight, the harder it is to hear those biological signals. I believe that finding self-acceptance and reducing rules and restrictions around food is the only long-term solution.For me, the first step toward getting off the Whole30-binge cycle was simply bringing attention to my obsession. As Roth writes, \"If you pay attention to when you are hungry, what your body wants, what you are eating, when you've had enough, you end the obsession, because obsession and awareness cannot coexist.\" The more awareness we bring to a moment, the more we can understand the wisdom behind the binge: what it\u2019s in reaction to and where it came from.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishSelf CareessayRead MoreLifestyleIs Your Wellness Practice Just a Diet in Disguise?By Melissa A.
