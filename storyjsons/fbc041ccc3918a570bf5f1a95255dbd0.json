I love the red ones. I love the purple ones. I love the pink ones. I love the waxy ones. I love the dry ones. I love the big ones. I love the small ones,\u201d she tells me over the phone, as if she\u2019s writing a Dr. Seuss recipe book.They're also the one food she\u2019d miss desperately if trapped at sea. In her new based-on-a-true-story film Adrift, the actress portrays Tami Oldham, a woman who fights to keep her and her fianc\u00e9, Richard Sharp (Sam Claflin), alive after they sail directly into Hurricane Raymond en route from Tahiti to San Diego. Potatoes were not an option for Oldham; she survived on canned food and peanut butter for 41 days.Back on dry land, Woodley and her partner have potatoes for dinner at least four nights a week. With \"parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme,\u201d she sings in her best Simon & Garfunkel impression (but really she goes for rosemary and thyme most of the time). Recently she's into Russian-style pan-fried taters. Her best friend\u2019s mom taught her a simple recipe: olive or grapeseed oil, \u201cobscene amounts of garlic\u2014like a whole head,\u201d onions, salt, and matchstick potatoes in a nonstick pan. \u201cThey get that nice crunch on the bottom, but they\u2019re super soft on the inside. Then you can crack on egg in it and make a little potato frittata.\u201dWoodley portrays Tami Oldham in Adrift.\nKirsty Griffin/STX FilmsIf Woodley was packing a bag of essentials before embarking on a long journey, she would opt for Barnana dehydrated banana bites ($4 on Thrive Market) and her LifeStraw ($40 for two on Amazon) over raw potatoes. Barnanas are more like chewy bites than banana chips and are made from \u201cimperfect\u201d bananas to prevent food waste, and Woodley explains that you can suck any water (except salt water) through the LifeStraw directly\u2014it will filter out bacteria and protozoa. Sure, she may get sick of dried bananas after a few weeks at sea, but they would make a good dipper for peanut butter.The moment that she got back on land, Shailene Woodley would find good water and reach for any type of moisturizer. \u201cGive me olive oil to throw on my skin, or coconut oil. After being under the sun and berated it all day long, moisturizer would be my long lost lover,\u201d she says. In an ideal world, it would be her favorite skincare product: Nyakio face moisturizer ($35 at Ulta). This moisturizer, and a handful of Nyakio\u2019s products contain coffee, which Woodley says makes them smell really good and wake you up. If anyone can encourage me to swap cold brew for coffee face polish tomorrow, it\u2019s Woodley. \u201cWhen I put that cream on in the morning, I feel like I can take on the world,\u201d she raves. Maybe the key to a great life is coffee moisturizer, dried bananas, and potatoes.
