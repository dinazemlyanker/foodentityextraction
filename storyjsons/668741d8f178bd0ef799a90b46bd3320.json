Up next, Carlie Steiner, the co-owner of Himitsu in Washington, D.C. and all-around powerhouse in the wine and spirits world.When I met Carlie Steiner for breakfast at Ell\u0113, she was late as hell. It was all good. I had nowhere to be, stuff to read, conversations to overhear\u2014and when things get too perfect, you know it\u2019s all about to blow up in your face anyway. She hopped in, crutches under her armpits. Ah, shit. A few days earlier, she\u2019d torn her ACL in a bike accident, and you know that stuff about perfect worlds all blown up? Hers just had.Steiner is the co-owner of Himitsu, one of our favorite restaurants in D.C., where she also runs the drinks program. If you go, here\u2019s my move: Line up at Himitsu at 4:30 p.m. even though it hurts, make it your mission to sit at the bar, order a glass of Baia\u2019s funkadelic skin-contact wine, all of the crudos, absolutely the fried oysters, and oh my god they have Peking duck now? I gotta go back.So the restaurant\u2019s amazing and the drinks are bomb, but the reason Steiner is a Person of Interest is because she represents a new generation of industry leaders. Her sommelier philosophy champions women winemakers, her hospitality philosophy puts family first, and nothing stands between her and her team. The manual she wrote for her employees includes generous policies for personal days and instructions for how to read body language and how to take action if a guest is sexually harassing a staff member\u2014or another patron. Oh that\u2019s nice in a book, you\u2019re thinking, but it translates to the floor of Himitsu, where Steiner circulates and keeps a lookout. \u201cI might not be the best boss in the world, but I\u2019m a damn good mom,\u201d she tells me. (Not literally\u2014she\u2019s keeping a mother\u2019s eye out for her team, though she also has a fluffy white dog named Storm.)We ordered nearly everything on the breakfast menu plus the anchovy-topped Caesar salad at Ell\u0113, and while I shoved peanut butter doughnut in my face, Steiner had a London Fog and laid it all out for me. The secrets of the universe...or at least a handful of them.I feel empowered when... I lift. I\u2019d never worked out a day in my life before I joined a gym earlier this year. My friend said, \u2018Come to the pool with me.\u2019 I was like, \u2018Oh, hell yeah.\u2019 You know, the Vida pool is super gay. I had the best day ever. It was like, All right. I\u2019m gonna join this for the pool. I realized it\u2019s a really empowering space. I can't tell you how many people have said, \u2018But, don\u2019t get too strong.\u2019 \u2018You look good where you are.\u2019 \u2018Don\u2019t go anymore.\u2019 I\u2019m like, \u2018Yeah, no.\u2019 I want to look beefy.I find joy in... Queer spaces. I have more fun when I\u2019m hanging out with a bunch of gay people. It\u2019s still not \u2018normal\u2019 to be gay. But [in queer spaces] I\u2019m like, No, no. It\u2019s normal.I work hard:  Educating my staff. [Ending sexual harassment] comes down to the management in restaurants, it comes down to owners in restaurants. Kick more people out, and take authority. I\u2019ve seen dates where I could clearly tell the woman was super uncomfortable. I asked, \u2018Would you like another round of cocktails?\u2019 She said, \u2018No, I'm okay.\u2019 The man said, \u2018No, she\u2019ll have another.\u2019 That\u2019s when I directly looked at him\u2014and because it\u2019s my space, I have the privilege to do this, but I also tell my team, 'You are empowered to do this. I would never fire you.' So, I said, \u2018No she won\u2019t. She said no.\u2019 Oh my god, I thought this guy was gonna punch me in the face.The biggest lesson I learned from working for Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s was... Take care of your staff, not your guests. Because your staff will take care of your guests. Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s is the only person I look up to in this world more than my dad. He\u2019s everything to me. He\u2019s a mentor. He is a personal friend. I want to be him like 100 percent. The thing is, at the end of the day, do you want to be a cook, do you want to be a chef, or do you want to change the fucking world?The best part of the restaurant industry is... The community, the family that you create, and the experiences you\u2019re able to create for other people.The worst party of the restaurant industry is... The constant and ongoing sexual harassment and not having a work-life balance.A good morning looks like... Gaining a new weight at the gym. Competing with myself, like I always do.Every day I... Do something gay. I purposefully say things when I do interviews now to get the stigmas taken away. To normalize lesbians and normalize mental health problems.I feel grounded when I\u2019m... Doing yoga. It\u2019s such a basic answer, but it\u2019s literally a reason so many people do it. Like straight-up savasana though. I\u2019m not talking about hard stuff. I just want to lie on the ground.I used to... Drink too much. I was 21. You think, You can\u2019t be an alcoholic at 21 but when I was working at Mini Bar, we\u2019d get blackout every single night, five nights a week. You just think, This is a bartender\u2019s life. It took a toll on my body and it took a toll on my mental health. Alcoholism runs in my family; alcoholism runs in my community. But I\u2019m not here to preach about not drinking either. I still drink because I\u2019ve learned that if I cut myself off completely from anything, then I want to do it. I just tell myself, \u2018Well, indulge when you want, but normally don\u2019t.\u2019 That\u2019s a much better method for me.I\u2019m inspired by... Ashtin Berry. She just keeps me in check. She keeps everyone in check. She\u2019s probably my biggest source of education right now outside of my own readings and studies. I\u2019m just trying to be a more inclusive, better person. She has a very direct way of talking to people that, for me, works.The cocktail that the world needs right now\u2026 Is a daiquiri. We should all be drinking more daiquiris.Explore Bon App\u00e9titPerson of InterestWashington, D.C.WineRead MorecultureHospitality Activist Ashtin Berry Enjoys Caviar Potato Chips, Radical Self-Awareness, and a Good Twerk SessionBy Shanika HillocksRecipes you want to make.
