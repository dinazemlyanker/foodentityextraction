If you sign up for our newsletter, you\u2019ll get her letter before everyone else.On BA earlier this month, we published a pumpkin soup recipe from a cookbook. For the cookbook author, the soup was an expression of a historic Haitian dish, soup joumou, which is eaten every year in Haiti and the diaspora on January 1, the day in 1804 enslaved people gained independence. The cookbook\u2019s soup recipe departed from important, foundational versions of soup joumou, and when we ran the recipe on Bon App\u00e9tit, we failed to provide enough context about either recipe, and BA\u2019s recipe name and headnote did not accurately represent the recipe we ran. Along with my team, I\u2019ve been working to understand the mistakes we made and how we can learn and improve. I have also been speaking with people in the Haitian culinary community, including L\u2019union Suite CEO Wanda Tima and Haitian Culinary Alliance founder Stephan Berrouet Durand.Tima created L\u2019union Suite when she was looking for ways to connect with \u201cHaitian hyphens\u201d like herself, and says her platform focuses on \u201cthe best of the best of our history and our country, what\u2019s going on in and outside the community, and, most important, education.\u201d Chef Durand first started Gout et Saveurs Lakay, a food and spirits festival in Haiti, and then launched the Haitian Culinary Alliance, which aims to promote Haitian cuisine across the globe. They graciously took the time to speak with me for this interview, in which we talk about Haitian food, the importance of both preserving and changing recipes, and more.There is a lot of nuance to the idea of \u201cadapting\u201d dishes. How can people make sure they are understanding and respecting the traditions or the foods while cooking with the ingredients they have on hand?Stephan Berrouet Durand: I think a perfect example is the French bouillabaisse. Bouillabaisse is from a very specific region in France. You can\u2019t make bouillabaisse any other way than the way they make it there. They\u2019ll tell you it\u2019s not bouillabaisse. Now, obviously, you can adapt certain ingredients to where you come from, but the essence of the dish has to be the same if you\u2019re going to call it that. Otherwise don\u2019t call it bouillabaisse. Call it something else. That\u2019s being respectful of tradition.Even if I\u2019m doing a variation of soup joumou or I\u2019m using a different protein, the essence stays the same. The preparation of the dish stays the same. I\u2019m not deviating or completely changing the dish. So even if I\u2019m using another protein, like seafood, I keep it the essence the same. And the flavor has to be the same. To the moment you put the spoon in your mouth, you know it\u2019s soup joumou. And that\u2019s important.Wanda Tima: Another thing that people don\u2019t even realize is that there are regional differences among Haitian cuisine. [There are foods Haiti is \u201cknown for\u201d] but certain places in Haiti are known specifically for certain dishes, and there are some dishes people might not eat if they\u2019re not from that area. Or there\u2019s a different recipe, depending on where you\u2019re from. Chef Nadege Fleurimond\u2019s books helped me understand a lot about the culinary side of Haiti and that a lot of these dishes come from different places in Haiti.When is it okay to change recipes\u2014or I guess, specifically, who should be able to change them?WT: We see people take the traditional recipes and change them every year. Like Chef said, we\u2019ve had people do the soup joumou with seafood only, or a vegan version of it. We\u2019ve seen people do it with salmon.People don\u2019t take away from the recipe, but they will add these other things. And we know, it\u2019s home, it\u2019s family. We understand that\u2019s happening and we create conversation around it. We ask our communities: Is this okay? Are we okay with this? And the comments are always 50-50. Some people are like, yes, we can remix it a little. And others say no, you do not mess with the recipe.The Haitian community has this saying: What happens at home, stays at home. The streets do not need to know our business. But inside the Haitian community, they\u2019ll talk. If I want to go viral for a week, I know I should do something with food, and I will go viral that week. I know it. It never fails. Haitians are so proud of our food.Wanda, you told me that every year around this time, at the start of the holidays, you start to hear from food writers. Is that a good thing or a bad thing?WT: We know around soup joumou time, there\u2019s going to be a lot of stories. A lot of publications want to write about it, or they\u2019re going to create their own. Every year you see the interest growing and growing more about this dish and the history that\u2019s tied behind it. And a lot of different chefs and people have an opportunity to tell that story. So we\u2019re happy. We\u2019re excited that\u2019s happening, but we want to make sure it\u2019s done right. We want to make sure they\u2019re reaching back home and tapping in Haitian chefs and speaking to Haitian chefs.We\u2019re happy now that we are getting attention from other areas in the world, and that it isn\u2019t just about politics or charity or giving back. We\u2019re happy that they have an interest in who we are now. But if you want to know who we are, we\u2019re happy that you\u2019re interested in us now on this level, but you have to come home.That\u2019s why you started L\u2019union Suite\u2014to highlight stories about the community from the community?WT: If you want to tell our story, you have to understand the core of it. You have to go to the people. I started L\u2019union Suite to find myself. I wasn\u2019t raised in the culture, and it was a journey for self-discovery, to connect with my people and find out as much as I could about this country me and my family are from. One of the biggest reasons why we are not connected is because we don\u2019t know, we\u2019re not educated enough. We don\u2019t know our own history. We don\u2019t know our contributions to the world. We grow up hearing so much of what people don\u2019t like, or whatever narrative the news is telling us about Haiti. And now we\u2019re invested in telling our story. We\u2019re invested in making sure that our narrative is clear about who we are.How does fighting negative stereotypes play a role in that?WT: Who we are is just as important as everyone else. We are so used to people not paying attention to us, or if they do pay attention to us, it\u2019s for their own benefit or spreading false narratives of who we are.I mean, our current president started his term in office talking bad about us, and bringing up all these false stereotypes. And we spent four years trying to fight some of these stereotypes that our ancestors fought to get away from.SBD: It is absolutely important because we carry this pride of being the first Black republic in the Western hemisphere. But we also carry the stigmas that all through the years have been put upon Haitian people. We\u2019re the one who created AIDS. We\u2019re the \u201cshithole\u201d country. Never been a conversation when they talk about Haiti, where they don\u2019t say it\u2019s the poorest country in the Western hemisphere. All of these things, they weigh on us.Is there anything else you want people to be thinking about?WT: For us as a community, this is brand-new. Seeing different chefs written about and on TV shows\u2014all of them are still trying to get their spotlight. [If it\u2019s a competition show], we don\u2019t care if they win or lose\u2014we\u2019re happy they were on the show. We\u2019re already excited.And if someone wins, forget it. They\u2019re one of our treasures. So it\u2019s not time for \u201chomages\u201d\u2014we don\u2019t even have that much to begin with. That\u2019s a reason why we\u2019re protective of it. We\u2019re still building it. We\u2019re still growing it. We can\u2019t afford to let anyone take away from it, because we\u2019re still building it ourselves.SBD: If you\u2019re going to give homage to something, do it right. Make sure that you in some place give recognition to who and where you took inspiration from. The story of our revolution itself is such an amazing story. This soup becomes more than a celebration\u2014it becomes almost part of our DNA.This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.Explore Bon App\u00e9titLetter From The EditorRecipes you want to make.
