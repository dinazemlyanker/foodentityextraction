Specifically, the eggs\u2019 size. [No, I will not be making any \u201csize matters\u201d jokes in this article so if that\u2019s what you\u2019re here for, turn around now.]In The Good Book of Southern Baking, Kelly Fields, chef and owner of Willa Jean in New Orleans, writes, \u201cThere are only two real rules on eggs, y\u2019all: get them fresh and get them local.\u201d But she also goes on to say that all of her recipes call for large eggs. The same is true of two other baking books that came out this year\u2014Claire Saffitz\u2019s Dessert Person and Melissa Weller\u2019s A Good Bake\u2014and also applies to almost any baking recipe you\u2019ll encounter. \u201cLarge is always a good assumption,\u201d says Jocelyn Drexinger, owner of New Hampshire bakery Mint and Mallow and baker at Nellie\u2019s Free Range. \u201c95\u201399% of the time, recipes are developed with large eggs.\u201d (Of course, if a recipe is specifically formulated with a certain egg size\u2014one famous Contessa, for example, bakes with extra-large\u2014seek them out for the most successful result.)Egg size matters more in some baking recipes than others. One good rule of thumb to keep in mind: The more eggs in a recipe, the more size will have a significant impact. As you add more eggs, that difference in weight\u2014~2 ounces for a large compared to ~2 \u00bc ounces for an XL and ~2 \u00bd for a jumbo\u2014is amplified. When a recipe calls for 4 eggs, for example, that small \u00bc-ounce discrepancy is suddenly a whopping 1 ounce.You\u2019ll also want to consider whether the eggs are vital for structure and/or flavor. In recipes that rely on eggs for leavening\u2014like sponge cakes, meringues, meringue-based cookies, choux pastry\u2014or for thickening\u2014like pastry cream and lemon curd\u2014you need a certain amount of egg for your dessert to reach its intended height, texture, and/or thickness. Use eggs that are too small and your cake could be under-leavened; too much whipped egg and it could rise dramatically in the oven, then fall when it\u2019s not able to handle the weight of the excess liquid.Eggs also affect the ratio of dry to wet ingredients, which changes the result even if those eggs don\u2019t play a critical role in leavening. Whereas cookies and cakes made with small eggs can be dry, dense, and crumbly, those made with big ones can be heavy, wet, and rubbery. Some cookies could pancake, while others might turn out overly cakey. Dough that you need to roll out\u2014like for sugar cookies\u2014could be frustratingly wet and sticky.Then there are what Drexinger calls \u201cfinicky recipes,\u201d where precision is important, and even a small difference in egg size can make a big change. In these cases\u2014like if you\u2019re making a \u201chigh ratio\u201d cake where the weight of sugar is nearly equal to the weight of flour\u2014eggs are vital to the structure of the baked good, holding the sugar, fat, and flour in harmony.And don\u2019t forget taste! In certain desserts\u2014custards, ice creams, flans, simple sponge cakes\u2014eggs provide that inimitable eggy flavor, and using smaller eggs will mean less of it. (In places where egg flavor really shines, their quality and freshness are also imperative.)Okay, but what if you like to keep jumbo eggs around for scrambling, frying, poaching, and hard-boiling? Or what if large eggs are nowhere to be found?The absolute best way to convert is, frankly, sort of annoying, since you\u2019ll need to get out the kitchen scale. You\u2019ll want to figure out the intended weight of the eggs. If the recipe calls for 3 large eggs, that\u2019s about 150 grams. You\u2019ll need to crack and whisk the eggs you\u2019re using, weighing until you reach 150. Save any extra for tomorrow\u2019s scramble (or a future egg wash). If your recipe calls for just whites or just yolks, you\u2019ll need to do the same thing\u2014separate your eggs, whisk them together, then weigh out the amount that\u2019s called for (I use this handy chart from Cook\u2019s Illustrated).But all in all, unless you\u2019re throwing caution to the wind and using four jumbo eggs when a recipe calls for four large, you\u2019ll \u201cstill get a cake or a cookie,\u201d says Drexinger, \u201cbut it might not be exactly what the recipe developer intended.\u201dBut where do medium eggs even come from???Excuse Me, Why Do 'Medium' Eggs Exist?Excuse me while I have an existential crisis in the egg aisle.View StoryExplore Bon App\u00e9titEggBasically BakingRecipes you want to make.
