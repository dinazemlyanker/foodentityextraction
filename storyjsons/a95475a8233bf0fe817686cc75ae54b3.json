I bet your boyfriend didn\u2019t even dump you the day after prom!But in high school, I had no such luck. I dealt with hormonal breakouts, the occasional monster zit, and pores as perennially clogged as a Taco Bell bathroom. My skin, while not terrible, was definitely not by any means good, so I was a sucker for words like \u201cclarifying,\u201d \u201cdetoxing,\u201d and \u201cpore-clearing.\u201d You know: Like a clay mask. Like Queen Helene. And like my first boyfriend, the mask didn\u2019t even do all that much for me, but I kept falling for it anyway.Old habits die hard, and though both my skin and taste in men has greatly improved in the 10 years since I was a teenager, I still can\u2019t help but feel seduced by the promises of a good clay mask. And Farmacy\u2019s Bright On Massage-Activated Vitamin C Mask makes a lot of bold promises: The clay-based formula claims to brighten, exfoliate, and detoxify skin in exchange for a mere $38 and 10 minutes of your time.It also requires some elbow grease, because the \u201cmassage-activated\u201d portion of the product name isn\u2019t just there for kicks. The mask starts out lavender and transforms into a pale green shade as you massage it in. Although this sounds like Instagram bait, which is something I think about now, both the massage step and color transformation are essential steps.\u201cVitamin C is inherently unstable and will lose its potency and efficacy if not protected,\u201d explains Kseniya Popova, associate director of innovation at Farmacy. For that reason, the vitamin C is stored in microcapsules to protect it from breaking down; by massaging it in, you burst the capsules, thereby releasing the vitamin C. Through some mechanism\u2014sorry, I dropped organic chemistry after one semester\u2014the mask then turns green, which is your indication to stop massaging.In addition to vitamin C, which does all the work of brightening, the mask also gently exfoliates with alpha hydroxy acids and detoxifies with a blend of clays. And while they had me at \u201cdetoxify,\u201d I\u2019m also an acid proselytizer (as you may know), so I\u2019m sold. Really, it\u2019s like a clay mask, antioxidant serum, and gentle peel in one. The combo will work for any skin type, but benefits dull, congested skin the most.Before I even put the mask on my face, I like it for a few reasons. First, it comes in a tube, which is both more hygienic and less messy than a jar. Then, the texture is more creamy than claylike, which makes the application easier. And finally, the bright, herbaceous scent is just\u2026relaxing. I can\u2019t tell what, exactly, it is\u2014the rosemary oil, the lavender oil, the peppermint oil, unlisted chloroform, who knows\u2014but I love it.I massage it in. I know that this step is technically for the purpose of releasing vitamin C, but it also does the same for my tension: It feels very calming, like a mental time-out. After all, how often do you take the time to massage skincare products into your skin? Sure, it\u2019s not the same as having a licensed aesthetician doing it for you, but I also don\u2019t have to tip, so.The mask eventually turns green and begins to dry. In the 10 minutes or so that it\u2019s on, it never feels tight or painful. I actually forget it\u2019s there altogether. And when I rinse it off, the mask melts off quickly\u2014a plus. Most clay masks require a power-washer to remove, and I usually give up and learn to live with swipes of dried clay around my neck and hairline.While the experience itself earns five stars, the results get four. My skin tone looks slightly more even and a bit brighter, and my skin definitely feels smoother. I don\u2019t notice much of an improvement in my pores, though, and it does nothing for a blackhead I keep fixating on.Still, it\u2019s a mask, not a miracle worker, and it does what it promises by giving my skin a refreshed glow. Whether it\u2019s the 10 minutes of zen or vitamin C, I\u2019ll never know\u2014but either way, it\u2019s still better than what clay masks used to be.Buy it: Farmacy\u2019s Bright On Vitamin C Mask, $38All products featured on Healthyish are independently selected by our editors.
