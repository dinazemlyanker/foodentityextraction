It\u2019s not just my colleagues these days. One friend I\u2019d fallen out of touch with texted for the first time in nine months to ask me if I had a good Key lime pie recipe, and another emailed to get my thoughts on pancakes. (Summary: they\u2019ll never be as good as waffles.) My mom has spent hours describing what she\u2019s made for dinner (it\u2019s always something from the New York Times LOL), an inquisitive stranger emailed me about the difference between dried and fresh dill, and someone who was much cooler than me in high school tagged me in her photo of Basically\u2019s ricotta gnocchi.Want this letter before it hits the website? Sign up for our newsletter!I\u2019m talking to more family members, friends, and potential friends than ever before (virtually speaking) because the topic that we have in common\u2014the glory and drudgery of cooking\u2014is also one of the only topics available. Which brings me here:One Good TipI Can\u2019t Believe This Garlic Trick Actually WorksI was surprised and delighted to receive a text from an unknown number this week about a mind-boggling garlic peeling tip. This is what we \u201cjournalists\u201d call an anonymous tip! Turns out the person was BA\u2019s art director Christa Guerra, who had learned the technique (honestly, this one does deserve the moniker \u201chack\u201d) from Nadiya Hussain on her show Nadiya\u2019s Time to Eat: Let separated garlic cloves sit in very hot water for one minute, after which their skins will slip right off.Turn your peeled n' sliced garlic into chips!\nPhoto by Alex Lau\u201cPlease try it so I make sure I\u2019m not insane and I\u2019m not wrong,\u201d wrote Christa, whose psychology reflects the times. So I tried it. And it worked great! It\u2019s probably not time-efficient if you only need to peel a few cloves, but if you\u2019re making, say, Chicken with 40 Cloves of Garlic, The Garlickiest Fried Rice, or Meera Sodha\u2019s 100 Garlic-Clove Curry from Made in India, it\u2019s a game-changer. I vastly prefer it to the metal bowl method.Just pull off their hats\u2014no knife necessary.\nPhoto by Laura MurraySomething to Bicker AboutHow Do You Cut a Strawberry?On FaceTime recently, my in-laws asked me to weigh in on an issue they\u2019d been arguing about for 24 hours: the proper way to cut a strawberry. (This is about the only issue I\u2019m even remotely qualified to weigh in on.) They showed me the two methods, trying their best to not reveal whose was whose. For the first, you slice the strawberry right across the top, removing the stem and a small area of flesh; for the second, you angle the knife inwards, drilling out the core (a.k.a. hulling). The first technique is fast but wasteful, which is why I prefer the second for big strawbs, which have those watery cores. But for the little guys (the best guys!), I just pull off the stem\u2014no need to slice at all. No tears were shed when I delivered the verdict.There's a good reason I didn't take a photo of these all rolled up.\nPhoto and Food Styling by Sarah Jampel\u00a0Best Thing I Ate This WeekTemakiI\u2019ve never made sushi at home because I don\u2019t have access to a mat or to super high-quality fish I\u2019d want to eat raw. (Also, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing.) But after making a public vow to use the oldest ingredients in my pantry\u2014namely, the sheets of roasted nori\u2014it was time for temaki. (It was Christina Chaey who got the idea of a hand roll party into my head.) I roasted salmon, then flaked off the flesh into a bowl and mixed in soy sauce, sesame oil, mayo, Sriracha, rice wine vinegar, and sliced scallions. I spread seasoned sushi rice onto the nori, then layered on more scallions, gomasio, sliced avocado, and the salmon. It tasted great even though I did a really bad job rolling it up (I partially blame the aged seaweed). I\u2019ll do better next time.Don't be jelly of this candy stash.\nMoment of AppreciationJelly BeansHere\u2019s a fun way to spend 10 minutes (or 30 if you\u2019re me!). Grab a selection of jelly beans. Tell whoever you\u2019re with to close their eyes, give them one bean at a time, and ask them to guess the flavor. This is hard and fun. My husband, who has declared jelly beans the only beans he cares about, guessed one of five. I got zero of three (I guessed that two of them were cantaloupe but, in my defense, one was watermelon). I\u2019ll do better next time.See you here next week!Recipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
