But I have never, ever felt left out, neglected, or overlooked at Calaca, a teeny-tiny Mexican restaurant a couple of blocks away from my apartment in Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn.Even though the menu is nearly as small as the space itself, vegetarians are well taken care of. Tacos and quesadillas aren\u2019t filled with mushy squash or slithering roasted peppers; instead, they\u2019re stuffed with huitlacoche (a.k.a. a savory, earthy, funky, delicious fungus that grows on blighted corn), roasted corn, and cotija. The tostadas hit the perfect equilibrium. They\u2019re so crisp they shatter, yet they\u2019re still sturdy enough to hold a pile of refried beans topped with queso fresco, thick slices of avocado, and pico de gallo.And if that\u2019s not enough to leave me satisfied, I order some snacks, which aren\u2019t throwaways or fillers: queso with mushrooms and pickled onions; guacamole with cotija and homemade chips; elote; or a couple of their homemade tortillas.From my spot at the bar, where the $5 happy hour margaritas are easier to access, I look over the small, candle-lit room, squint to spot any minor celebrities (and by that I mean the coolest girl in my college class or that culture writer for the New York Times), and take comfort in the fact that I\u2019m not jealous of anyone around me\u2014even if it\u2019s clear they\u2019re thoroughly enjoying their carnitas and mahi-mahi and red snapper. I\u2019m loving my corn smut just as much.Go there: CalacaExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendRestaurantsMexicanNew YorkRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
