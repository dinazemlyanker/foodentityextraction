Pat salmon dry, then season with kosher salt. Heat 1 Tbsp. oil in a large ovenproof nonstick skillet over medium.

Cut flesh from cores in a variety of shapes and sizes and arrange on plates.

Spoon over salad and sprinkle with sea salt.How would you rate Roast Salmon With Citrus and Coconut-Chile Crunch?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (8)Back to TopTriangleAmazing! This recipe is so simple but packs a flavor punch. Variety is the spice of life citrus wise here - I used blood oranges, mandarins, pommelo grapefruit and a few kumquats for a tangy / bitter kick. The chile coconut crisp could definitely be doubled to top a side of veg. I did the citrusy stir-fry asparagus from 2019. Holy moly. What a pair! If you dig citrus. LmSanta Fe2/17/2022The crisp was delicious - I used two Fresno chilies and it was reasonably spicy, as well as rice vinegar. Great over pan fried chicken thighs the next day.\n\nThe dish was plenty good with grapefruit, cara cara & blood oranges. Served with white rice as it was already on hand, but next time will try pilaf or cous cous.\n\nNext time I'll do more grapefruit and skip the cara cara. I might try the white balsamic, or a vinegar with more of a kick than rice vinegar. I might make a small amount of a soy-shaoxing wine-black vinegar marinade to cook the salmon in, or reduce it and pour as a bit of sauce over the salmon before adding the topping... the dish was missing some umami and sour notes to balance out the sweeter citrus (and salmon, which is a bit sweet but not too umami on its own). It would benefit from some light greens underneath along with the citrus, maybe some pea shoots or other baby green (not anything too herby like cilantro).\n\n3.5/5 stars as presented but this dish has 5/5 potential with tweaks.sarinaboston ma1/30/2022All the elements of this were individually good, but the citrus totally overpowered the salmon. The crisp didn\u2019t get crispy, maybe too much oil, but was delicious with either salmon or citrus. Used satsuma, cara cara orange, and grapefruit. Would make citrus crunch as salad with salmon on the side. KatOak Park IL1/30/2022Made with mahi mahi b/c that's what I had. Jalepe\u00f1os weren't hot after cooking. Delish!\nI get the magazine but like to print the recipe from here.MimiBend, Oregon1/27/2022Made with macadamia nuts instead of peanuts because we were feeling fancy and can\u2019t recommend highly enoughDanika1/26/2022Great recipe and a lovely mix of flavors. I had a hard time getting the coconut peanut mix to \u201ccrisp\u201d up, but It still tasted delicious.  Used a mix of pink grapefruit, minneola, and blood orange. Could see mango, avocado or thinly sliced red onion being nice additions too! Will definitely make again! Spatulacity Los Angeles1/26/20221/22. Really elegant, easy and delicious. Halved recipe for 2 of us. Otherwise made as written. Worthy of a special company meal. The flavors all compliment each other. Served with roasted asparagus.Lynn1/23/2022The flavors of this recipe are phenomenal!  I was able to find large coconut flakes (chips) and they added a fabulous crunch.  Used unsalted walnuts as I was unable to find unsalted peanuts. I also included an avocado with the citrus.  Blended perfectly with the salmon.  Highly recommend this recipe.Kim Seattle, WA1/16/2022Explore Bon App\u00e9titDinnerWeeknightEasySalmonFishSeafoodCitrusFruitCoconutWinterGrapefruitOrangeTangerineFresno ChileChileVegetableJalape\u00f1oSerrano ChileMainGluten-FreeDairy-FreeRoastRecipes you want to make.
