You actually don\u2019t want to let shrimp sit in the marinade for too long because the acid in the citrus will start to firm up and cook the flesh.Ingredients4 servings6garlic cloves, smashed2habanero chiles, seeds removed, chopped13\" piece ginger, peeled, thinly sliced\u2153cup fresh lime juice\u2153cup fresh orange juice1Tbsp. sugar2tsp. unseasoned rice vinegar\u00bdtsp. ground turmeric\u2153cup vegetable oil, plus more for grillKosher salt1\u00bdlb. large shrimp, peeled, deveinedCooked short-grain white rice (for serving; optional)Flaky sea saltPreparationStep 1Prepare a grill for medium-high heat.

Will make this often!AnonymousNiwot, CO2/2/2022Quick, easy and delicious! Served ours over couscous, it was garlicky and flavorful!Anonymous7/5/2021Delicious and pretty easy. The sauce is good, but it is thin so definitely serve with rice or something else to help soak it up. Two habaneros had just the right amount of kick for me, but if you\u2019re not a fan of spice I would recommend only using one or using a milder pepper. AnonymousSan Francisco, CA5/30/2021this was great! served with pearl couscous and a cucumber salad, topped with green onion.AnonymousToronto, CA3/24/2021My family really enjoyed this! We cut down to one habanero which was at the top of the spice limit for us (seeded and de-veined). I added a bit more lime, sugar, and about 1/2 teaspoon of fish sauce. Also some chopped cilantro for serving. \n\nFor the reserved sauce, I put it in a sauce pan and added a little bit of heavy cream to thicken and reduce for extra dipping for the table. \n\nButtered jasmine rice, broccolini, and a side salad made this an excellent meal!Alexandra RabeLafayette, CA11/29/2020This is one of my favorite BA recipes!!! Sweet, spicy, tangy, garlicky! Serve with jerk chicken and coconut rice for a showstopper meal Luna Miami, Florida 10/28/2020This was awesome. Instead of habaneros, I used a poblano that I roasted on an open flame first to blister off the skin.  Easy and delicious. We served it over fresh greens From our CSA that we dressed with the sauce.AnonymousSeattle, WA6/24/2020I'm a good cook, and my boyfriend said that this is his favorite dish that I've ever cooked. I made no changes to the recipe, served over rice and it was lick-the-plate good.AnonymousDetroit, MI8/22/2019SUPER delicious sauce! Must serve with rice to soak up every bit of it. Has been saved into our recipe book. Yum!soundsofsilencesNew Jersey7/17/2019Super easy to pull together and very tasty.  To be on the safe side, I removed all seeds and ribs from the habaneros, and it wasn't very spicy at all, so you may want to keep some of those in if you prefer spicier.  Served with basmati rice and grilled asparagus.  The sauce adds flavor and doesn't overpower whatever it's on.  It was so AMAZING on the rice, we started making us wonder what else it would be good on.  Made it again this past weekend and soaked some smoked pulled pork in it, served on grilled Hawaiian rolls - amazing!  A friend asked for the recipe and plans to make it with pulled chicken.  We'll be keeping the recipe handy for future meals!TXHuskerTexas7/16/2019Wonderful flavor! Citrusy with a kick, I followed the recipe to the dot, and love it! But the sauce is a little thin, would love to know if anyone has any ideas how to thicken it up to serve with the shrimps? AnonymousAnaheim, CA 6/28/2019Delicious dish for a summer evening. We paired the shrimp with basmati rice, a nice salad of fresh local greens and vinaigrette and sweet corn. We'll definitely make it again for company!AnonymousMinnesota6/3/2019This is my new favorite shrimp recipe! Excellent, I love the sweetness/tanginess and the spicy flavor. Will definitely be making this again!nick016NYC6/2/2019This recipe is wonderful. It's like a tropical curry sauce, super flavorful and oh so fresh, and it comes together in minutes in the blender. I made it with both shrimp, as recommended here, and chicken for my shrimp averse boyfriend, and served it over sushi rice. It was great with the chicken too, but has to spend more time marinating. It was a huge hit all around. Can't wait to make this again.AnonymousAL5/30/2019Explore Bon App\u00e9titShrimpShellfishSeafoodTurmericHerbs & SpicesGarlicVegetableHabanero ChileChileSummerQuickEasyWeeknight MealsMainDairy-FreeGluten-FreeNut-FreeKetoHealthyishGrillingMemorial DayLabor DayDinnerRecipes you want to make.
