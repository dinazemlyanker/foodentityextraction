He\u2019s always in the kitchen\u2014developing recipes, filming demos, meal planning, feeding his family... So when he makes a statement like, \u201cthere\u2019s a dearth of good liquid measuring cups out there,\u201d I sit up and listen.\u201cI\u2019m over glass measuring cups,\u201d he continues, settling into one of his thorough, tested, mad scientist\u2013like arguments. \u201cMost measuring cups are made from brittle glass, not the hefty borosilicate glass that can withstand heat changes better and are more resistant to breakage. Plus, try stacking those handled measuring cups. They become a cumbersome, unwieldy assemblage.\u201dThe solution, he said, was OXO Good Grips Squeeze & Pour Silicone Measuring Cups. And then he explained why. They\u2019re structured enough to stand up on their own, but flexible enough to squeeze into a narrow spout for precise pouring. The material dissipates heat to protect your hands from whatever hot contents they hold, and their honeycomb-like textured surface means your grip won\u2019t slip. They have \u201camazing nesting abilities\u201d so you won\u2019t lose space to all those protruding handles. AND, they can also go directly from the microwave to the refrigerator or freezer (or vice versa) without breaking. Oh, and they\u2019re very easy to clean.Available in 4-cup, 2-cup, 1-cup, and \u201cmini\u201d sizes, they\u2019re so handy, they might even take the place of other kitchen tools. Take a morning pancake feast for example: Skip the bowl and mix your ingredients right in the largest measuring cup. Ditch the ladle, and pour the batter into perfect rounds straight into the pan. Fill another, smaller cup with some maple syrup and pop it in the microwave til warm. Pass it around the table without scaling your kids, and fear fewer drips at the same time.If that won\u2019t convince you, then just take it from always-in-the-kitchen Chris: \u201cThey\u2019re everything.\u201dBuy It: OXO Good Grips 3 Piece Squeeze & Pour Silicone Measuring Cup Set, $20 on AmazonAll products featured on Bonappetit.com are independently selected by our editors.
