Consider them an indulgent energy bite: Keep 'em in the fridge, then grab one when the craving hits.IngredientsMakes 10\u2154cup plus 1 Tbsp. unsalted, shelled raw pistachios, divided4Medjool dates\u2153cup tahini (such as Soom)3Tbsp. pure maple syrup\u00betsp. kosher salt\u00bccup plus 2 Tbsp. unsweetened cocoa powder, divided1Tbsp. toasted sesame seedsPreparationStep 1Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment.

I will definitely be making them again, this is a great recipe.AnonymousLondon, UK2/18/2022Made these with hazelnuts instead of pistachios because that's what I had on hand. These were delicious! So quick and easy to make!AnonymousCalifornia1/20/2020Let's be realistic: mine will never look as picture perfect as the photo illustrating this recipe does. I've no clue how one half is perfectly coated in nuts and the other perfectly coated in cocoa powder -- during my double dip, my fingers smudged off one or the other side. After a few hours in the fridge, the cocoa started to be absorbed by the ball. However, looks aside, the taste cannot be matched. I daresay they improve with a day of aging in the fridge! Skip the 'wrap each ball in plastic' instruction -- this is probably to preserve the coating's integrity more than anything and well, as described, who cares so much about that? Plus it's unnecessarily wasteful of plastic. These couldn't have been easier to make though! Go ahead and make double (though be wary of your food processor's capacity) since they last! I made mine with roasted/salted pistachios and just didn't add any extra salt, and the flavor is still good.breebridger3741Houston, TX10/30/2019These are AMAZING. I have been trying to find a healthier version of halva, and this hits the spot! I have used cashews and walnuts in place of the pistahios and it is still amazing. I have also not coated them in sesame seeds before and they still taste great!
