A new recipe to make all summer, or hang in MoMA.By Alex BeggsJune 8, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Chelsie Craig, Food Styling by Chris Morocco, Prop Styling by Emily EisenFacebookTwitterEmailI recently read this popular article about finding happiness (normal place to look for happiness) and I can\u2019t stop thinking about how custard is an important part of the process. Make gratitude lists, take personality quizzes, meditate, spend time with people you love, eat custard. Yale students pay for this kind of info and yet here it is, on a random blog post! I have all the answers, and yet no one\u2019s asking me the questions.In this new recipe for a summer berry fruit tart, Chris Morocco kept things simple. The crust is a press-in almond flour and butter combo, which is baked until deeply golden and has this toasted, nutty, expensive flavor. (Or maybe I just taste \u201cexpensive\u201d when I\u2019ve seen the price of the almond flour bag. Why do I love the finer things in life?! I blame MTV.) You can also make it with AP flour, FYI. The custard is your straightforward mixture of eggs, whole milk, sugar, vanilla, and cornstarch. You can even make that days ahead and accidentally eat it all and forget about the whole thing, lost in your custard coma. Or you can chill it, and add it to the cooled crust, top with berries, and impress all of your friends and countrymen. Choice is yours!A note on the berries:Yes, Chris is going through his Blue Period. How pretty is the blueberry-blackberry confluence here? Very! However, say strawberries are in season for you and you\u2019d rather do a red theme, fine, but add the cut fruit right before serving, otherwise you risk this horror (not really) I call \u201cpuddling.\u201d That\u2019s when a fruit with a high water content (strawberries, pineapple), when cut, leaks a little on the custard and the whole thing sits around, looking like someone sobbed over it. So, uh, yeah, blueberries! Blackberries! Raspberries!
