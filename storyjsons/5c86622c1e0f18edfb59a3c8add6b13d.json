Cook the grains in well-salted water for much longer than you'd think; until the rice is splitting open, it's not done.Ingredients8 servings 1cup pecans2cups wild rice, such as\u00a0RiceSelect\u00ae Royal Blend\u00ae RiceKosher salt\u00bccup red wine vinegar2Tbsp. fresh orange juice2Tbsp. honey1garlic clove, crushed\u00bdcup extra-virgin olive oil, divided, plus more for drizzling2large leeks, white and pale green parts only, tough outer layer removed, halved lengthwise, thinly sliced crosswise12oz. mushrooms (such as maitake, chanterelle, and/or oyster), torn or cut into large piecesFreshly ground black pepper2tsp. chopped thyme\u2153cup sliced chivesPreparationStep 1Preheat oven to 350\u00b0. Toast pecans on a rimmed baking sheet, tossing once, until slightly darkened and fragrant, 6\u20138 minutes. Let cool, then coarsely chop.Step 2Cook wild rice in a large pot of boiling salted water until most of the grains have split and all are tender, 40\u201350 minutes; drain and rinse under cold running water. Shake off as much water as possible and let cool.Step 3Meanwhile, whisk vinegar, orange juice, and honey in a large bowl to combine. Add garlic and let sit 10 minutes to infuse.

Arrange mushrooms in skillet in a single layer and cook, undisturbed, until undersides are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper, toss, and continue to cook, tossing often and reducing heat as needed to avoid scorching, until golden brown all over, about 3 minutes longer. Mix in thyme and immediately transfer to bowl with rice. Add pecans and chives and drizzle with more oil; toss once more.Step 6Do Ahead: Rice can be cooked 1 day ahead. Let cool; cover and chill.

What's the point...? I'm from MinnesotaAnonymousMinneapolis 11/13/2021This is a really delicious and well-balanced recipe. I made it twice, once as a test, and again for my Thanksgiving table. The only difference I made the second time was adding less of the vinaigrette; it adds some really nice depth and acidity to the rice, but I found the full amount listed in the recipe to be overpowering of the other flavors in the dish. With some slight adjustments, this was a hit at my table! isheetaSan Diego, CA11/26/2018Explore Bon App\u00e9titStuffingAmericanPecanNutLeekVegetableMushroomChiveHerbs & SpicesRiceRice & GrainsFallSideGluten-FreeSaut\u00e9SimmerThanksgivingRecipes you want to make.
