CBD oilExtra-virgin olive oil (for drizzling; optional)Flaky sea saltPreparationStep 1Coat a 9x5\" loaf pan with nonstick spray (a metal pan will conduct cold more efficiently than tempered glass). Line pan with plastic wrap, leaving a generous overhang on all sides.Step 2Using an electric mixer on high speed, beat egg whites and kosher salt in a medium bowl until frothy, about 1 minute. With the motor running, gradually add \u2153 cup sugar and beat until medium peaks form, about 5 minutes. With the mixer on medium-high speed, gradually add remaining \u2153 cup sugar and continue to beat until stiff, glossy peaks form, 6\u20138 minutes.Step 3Using clean beaters, whip cream in another medium bowl until soft peaks form. Fold one-third of whipped cream into egg whites. Finely zest lemon over egg white mixture, then squeeze in 2 Tbsp. fresh lemon juice. Add sesame seeds and CBD oil, then gently fold in remaining whipped cream until just combined.Step 4Transfer mixture to prepared pan and place a piece of parchment paper on top, pressing directly onto surface. Freeze until semifreddo is firm, about 6 hours.Step 5Remove parchment paper from surface of semifreddo and, using plastic overhang, gently lift from pan. Invert semifreddo onto a large platter, peel away plastic wrap, and slice 1\" thick. Divide among plates and let sit 5 minutes to soften slightly. Drizzle with olive oil (if using) and top with sea salt.Step 6Do Ahead: Semifreddo can be made 3 days ahead.
