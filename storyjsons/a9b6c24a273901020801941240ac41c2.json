Puglisi\u2019s all-day restaurant and bakery.ORDER THE: sourdough croissant; ham and cheese croissant; the best house-made yogurt we\u2019ve ever had with granola; pasta of the day; and any of the freshly made cheeses. Organic ingredients, many from Puglisi\u2019s farm, work their way into handmade pastas, charcuterie, and more small plates assembled in the kitchen they share with neighboring B\u00e6st. Brunch is popular (see yogurt, above), so be sure to book ahead.THE VIBE IS: kinda French? Definitely cool, with locals huddled together at shared tables and around the bar.PRACTICAL STUFF: Open every day. Breakfast is served Monday to Friday from 8:30 to 11:30 a.m. and Saturday and Sunday from 8:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. Lunch rolls out  Monday to Friday from 11:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. and Saturday and Sunday from 1 to 3 p.m. Dinner is Monday to Thursday from 5 to 9:30 p.m and Friday and Saturday from 5 p.m. to 10 p.m.\u2014Christine MuhlkePhoto by Ditte IsagerPhoto by Ditte IsagerPhoto by Ditte IsagerWE ALSO LOVEJuno the BakeryFuel up for those canalside bike rides with these outstanding \u00d8sterbro carbs108Noma\u2019s more casual spin-off in Christianshavn, with kombucha-shellacked pastriesThe Coffee CollectiveA pour-over (and upcycled coffee kombucha) is always in reach, thanks to this mini chainExplore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
