But they\u2019re more complicated than they seem.By Mahira RiversOctober 18, 2021FacebookTwitterEmailIllustration By Allegra LockstadtFacebookTwitterEmailOn February 14, around 5 p.m., Brian Bornemann was finally ready to plate the vegan Caesar salad in his five-course Valentine\u2019s Day dinner menu. Presale tickets for the event had sold out, plus the host for the night saved some tables for walk-ins. Bornemann nervously eyed the wood for the grill and counted the boules of crusty bread again, hoping that he and his partner, Leena Culhane, had brought enough. When he reached for the garnish\u2014an umami-rich furikake that\u2019s an integral part of the salad\u2014Bornemann realized that he forgot to pack it. So he quickly hopped in a car to pick it up. This never would have happened if he was cooking out of his own kitchen space instead of popping up on a friend\u2019s patio. As the former executive chef of Michael\u2019s in Los Angeles, Bornemann never thought he\u2019d be drifting from one venue to another with a cooler of ingredients\u2014and only a weekend to get it right.But when the pandemic put Bornemann out of work, that\u2019s exactly what he did, with the help of Culhane. The couple created a concept grounded in high-quality raw fish preparations and called it Crudo e Nudo. They knew it would be hard work, but any work was welcome at the time. \u201cWe just saw an opportunity,\u201d Bornemann says. The low barrier to entry and the appealing limited nature of the pop-up model has been a gift to enterprising restaurateurs over the past year, but the fast and loose circumstances that are so conducive to pop-ups can also leave them vulnerable. \u201cEvery pop-up we did\u2026was a handshake and a look in the eye and you just had to hope for the best,\u201d Bornemann says. \u201cIt is a very precarious thing.\u201d For every consideration that might make a pop-up successful, from choosing a partner to negotiating the contracts and managing logistics, there is an equal share of risk.One of the most consequential decisions for a pop-up vendor is finding a host for the event. These collaborations work best when they are mutually beneficial, and the pandemic presented an abundance of such circumstances: Some bars, for example, couldn\u2019t stay open as essential businesses in cities like Los Angeles unless they offered food, which was the perfect opening for a roving operation like Crudo e Nudo. But despite even the best intentions, and because the rationale to establish a pop-up is sometimes rooted in necessity, there can be an unsettling power dynamic.This is perhaps most apparent when a pop-up vendor partners with a landlord, who may have different objectives in the outcome of a pop-up. \u201cAt the end of the day, a landlord\u2019s business model is centered on getting maximum revenue from their space,\u201d says Nick Wiseman, who ran a Middle Eastern rotisserie chicken pop-up, Little Sesame, in Washington D.C.; it was an extension of the existing fast-casual concept by the same name. Wiseman and his business partners chose to collaborate with a friend in the industry and fellow business owner specifically because both sides understood the challenges of running a food business. \u201cIf there were scheduling issues or things happening in the city out of our control, we both shared that downside together.\u201dIn some cases, the host, landlord or not, might not have the relevant knowledge to be an effective partner. Nobody can know the ins and outs of operating, say, a transient raw fish bar like Crudo e Nudo better than the ones doing the work. Which is why having conversations up front to lay out the terms is crucial. \u201cSome hosts wanted all the control,\u201d Bornemann says. \u201cThey wanted to be involved in the pricing, the size of certain dishes, and even the ability to critique dishes.\u201d In those cases, Bornemann and Culhane decided to walk away from those deals rather than risk a contentious partnership. The pair also kept a full calendar of events as a general safety net in case an event didn\u2019t turn a profit. \u201cIf anything ever went south, we knew we had another pop-up booked in a day or two.\u201dIt\u2019s not just a question of being successful but being able to do it at our pace in terms of life balance.Food halls are a useful comparison because they are similarly structured as a host and vendor partnership and because a restaurant\u2019s best practices don\u2019t always line up with the requirements of running a stall. Margaret Pak and Vinod Kalathil started their South Indian pop-up Thattu as a stall at the Politan Row food hall in Chicago. The gig was great for brand-building, but the amount of work didn\u2019t justify the profits in the end. Pak and Kalathil were obligated to staff the stall all day, even though the bulk of their sales were made in quick bursts at lunch and dinner. They also had to stick to the same menu, which would provide consistency for customers but was creatively stifling. Ultimately, the experience made the flexibility of a pop-up model that much more appealing. After just nine events, they have earned almost as much as they did over 10 months of full-time food hall vending. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a question of being successful but being able to do it at our pace in terms of life balance,\u201d Kalathil says.Managing liability is another important part of running a pop-up, whether it\u2019s specifying payment terms after an event or planning for worst-case scenarios like property damage or personal injury. \u201cThere are always risks that carry financial implications in any type of startup business,\u201d says Michael Farhi, a partner at the law firm Kates Nussman Ellis Farhi & Earle, LLP, who practices business law. \u201cLaying out the basic terms in writing in the beginning is always the best protection.\u201d And yet, most pop-up partnerships are actually formed over handshake deals. For Pak and Kalathil, everything was done verbally, but working with friends in the industry was the surest way to minimize the risk of a bad deal. Bornemann and Culhane made up for the lack of a contract by showing up to each event with a valid food handler\u2019s license and general liability insurance.Informal agreements are ubiquitous in part because pop-ups are so swift and scrappy, but also, contracts are an imperfect tool that require time and money to enforce\u2014scarce resources for vendors. Yana Gilbuena started out as a pop-up vendor in 2013 when she famously staged 50 Filipino kamayan dinners in 50 states for an event called SALO Series. At one dinner, Gilbuena recalls paying out of pocket to cover a slew of unexpected charges from the host, like payment processing fees, plus food costs for a number of unplanned guests. The unexpected charges went against the contract Gilbuena had for that event, but rather than hire a lawyer, she decided to just move on. \u201cI had a choice to expend the energy and time or I could just focus on learning from my mistakes.\u201d Ultimately, the evening cost her more money than she made.Over the past year, countless hosts have opened their spaces to brand new pop-up concepts in support of the many restaurant workers who lost their jobs in the pandemic. This proliferation of impromptu cottage businesses and ever-changing rules increased the risk of being shut down by health inspection officials. Sara Valdes has been hosting pop-ups at her eponymous corner store, Sara\u2019s Market, in East Los Angeles since 2017. But last summer, two pop-ups at Sara\u2019s were shut down by the Department of Public Health for the apparent violation of local vending laws. In both cases, all the food from the event was trashed. \u201cWe try to do as much as we can to help them,\u201d Valdes says. \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to survive during the pandemic.\u201dHosts themselves have a unique set of risks to consider as well. Tommy York is the owner of a specialty food store and caf\u00e9 in Ann Arbor, Michigan, called York, which has hosted close to 100 pandemic pop-ups. Recently, someone working on a pop-up was injured while breaking down equipment from an event. Fortunately, it wasn\u2019t a major accident, but there was emergency medical care involved and no concrete plan. \u201cIf someone gets hurt, who\u2019s on the hook?\u201d York says. Because of that incident, he is working on the terms of a contract that would address this kind of situation. York has also had to deal with the messier aspects of crowd control as people wander around at night with drinks in hand onto parts of his property that aren\u2019t covered by the liquor license. \u201cWe\u2019ve had the neighbors get a little cranky, and I have to go over and say, \u2018Sorry about that.\u2019\u201dAfter a tough year like the last one, the associated risks of a pop-up clearly couldn\u2019t deter from the benefits: the freedom to pursue a passion project, stay working and earn some money, and cultivate a community\u2014all mostly on one\u2019s own terms. Plus, it could be a launchpad for something bigger. Bornemann and Culhane recently opened Crudo e Nudo as a full-service restaurant and seafood market on Main Street in Santa Monica. They now have the luxury of full-size refrigerators and kitchen prep space, control over the customer experience, and a much-needed liquor license. Starting out as a roving pop-up concept was an integral part of the journey and a fast-track to building a business, but settling down has its benefits too. \u201cHonestly, we don\u2019t miss much about pop-ups\u2014we have so much more control in our own space,\u201d Bornemann says. But there were invaluable lessons learned along the way. For Culhane, the process highlighted just how rewarding it is to build a community. \u201cThis is all about connecting, that\u2019s why we do what we do.\u201d Now, the couple are able to welcome their guests with the assured hospitality and consistency of a traditional restaurant. And the furikake is always within arm\u2019s reach.Explore Bon App\u00e9titRestaurantsRead MorerestaurantsMy Career in Restaurants Taught Me What Local Government Really NeedsBy Francesca Hong cultureWant to Join These Dinner Clubs?
