Probably the most opinionated group of people I know, and I was voted \u201cmost opinionated\u201d in high school. So when it came down to developing BA\u2019s Best Matzo Ball Soup\u2014a dish that\u2019s loaded with lots of family history, emotional connection, and personal experience, and not just for us Jewish-identifying editors\u2014I knew there\u2019d be lots of opinions. But I also knew that no matter what, mine would be right.I grew up with my dad\u2019s killer matzo ball soup, a perfectly salted broth with chunks of chicken, two fluffy, palm-sized matzo balls, a smattering of carrot coins, a dusting of parsley and dill, and a crack of freshly ground black pepper on top. It slays every Passover dinner my family hosts, but I crave it (and eat it) all year round. IMHO, that\u2019s all the qualification I needed to develop the perfect recipe with senior food editor Molly Baz, who married into a Jewish family and knows how to handle these kinds of opinions with ease and confidence. But because this is a democracy and we\u2019re all about collaboration at BA, I decided to play nice and go through the motions of taking other people\u2019s views into account anyway. Here\u2019s how development went down.Day 1: \u201cAre you consulting on a construction site? Why do you have a clipboard?\u201d I ask Molly as she goes desk by desk, asking each editor about their must haves. \u201cOne big ball or two small balls? Chicken in the soup? How does the cloudiness of the soup affect your time eating it? What about veggies in there? And what shape are the veggies?\u201d Associate editor Alex Delany and food director Carla Lalli Music (neither of whom identify as Jewish) are big fans of one big ball. \u201cBut that\u2019s Jewish deli\u2013style, not home cooking! Two balls FOR SURE,\u201d I interrupt. Editorial assistant Emma Wartzman wants them between tennis and golf ball size. Senior editor Sasha Levine wants the whole thing loaded with herbs. I look over Molly\u2019s shoulder and see notes (\u201cwet noise\u201d\u2014excuse me, what?) scrawled all across her page. No one seems to agree. Molly looks stressed.I tell her everything\u2019s going to be ok, and that there will be two balls in the soup, thank you very much.Day 2: \u201cCome taste my matzo ballz!!!!\u201d Is the excited Slack message I receive from Molly at 3:29 p.m. on a Tuesday. Her station in the Test Kitchen is set up like a matzo ball lab. She\u2019s testing every variable: Simmer them in salt water or broth? Mix \u2018em with schmaltz or oil? Add fresh herbs? Use seltzer? What about baking powder? Shape with your hands, or a cookie scoop? Can they be over handled? (Spoiler: NO! We tried everything and discovered over handling is a myth! Read that story here.) We try SO. MANY. MATZO. BALLS.In the end, we decide on an herby-schmaltz mixture in a salt water simmer. They\u2019re small enough that you can have two to a bowl, but substantial enough that they don\u2019t disappear. I feel satisfied.Day 3: Legs dangling from the Test Kitchen\u2019s marble countertop, Molly doles out bowls of golden broth. What I think is going to be a 10-minute tasting turns into an hour long discussion about what to do with the chicken. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the meal. It\u2019s the pre-meal. You don\u2019t want people to fill up,\u201d Basically editor Amiel Stanek argues. I tell Amiel that I make matzo ball soup more than once a year, and sometimes it is my entire meal. Therefore, I\u2019d like some chicken in there. Molly\u2019s concerns are more technical: If you simmer a whole chicken to make the broth, the breast and the legs cook at different times, resulting in an overcooked breast or undercooked leg\u2014neither of which you really want to eat. More questions come up: Should the broth be blonde or a deeper, darker brown? What do we do with the stock vegetables? Should we roast them first, give \u2018em a quick saut\u00e9, add \u2018em in raw? It\u2019s 12:30 p.m. Molly needs a drink.Instead, she makes a few more options, we taste through them, and make our decision: A broth made from roasted chicken wings, for color and body (thanks, collagen!), that get milked (umm, simmered) for all they\u2019re worth, then tossed. Then we add in chicken legs for some extra flavor and heft, without any dried-out, overcooked nonsense. That\u2019s three points for me, if you\u2019re keeping score.Day 4: If you\u2019ve seen Molly\u2019s rotisserie chicken pot pie, you know she is not a fan of carrots. Which is why I feel exceptionally excited to let you know that there ARE carrot coins in this soup. \u201cWho actually gets pleasure out of eating a soggy carrot coin?\u201d Molly and Carla ask the staff. \u201cWE DO!!!\u201d we all over-enthusiastically proclaim. (Except for digital director Carey Polis, whose chunks are so large, they never get too mushy.) Molly compromises and decides to discard the carrots used in the stock, and add fresh coins to the pot 3 to 4 minutes before serving. \u201cYou know what?\u201d she whispers. \u201cI like them more than I expected to.\u201d Another win.The Final Result: The soup checks all the boxes. There\u2019s a delicately herby, very chicken-y broth; two-inch, dill-packed matzo balls; tender, shreddy chicken leg meat; and not-too-soggy carrot coins. It\u2019s flavorful without going over the top; satisfying without being overwhelming. It reminds me a lot like my dad\u2019s soup. Remember what I said about my opinions?Get the recipe:BA's Best Matzo Ball SoupThis recipe serves eight people generously (with two balls each) but could easily stretch to serve 16 smaller appetizer-sized portions.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titPassoverSpringSoupRecipes you want to make.
