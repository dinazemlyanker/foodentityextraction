Their flaky, portable pastries come stuffed with a variety of ingredients\u2014like beef laced with caramelized onions; fluffy potato; and sweet Nutella (a flavor that makes my inner child squeal)\u2014and are traditionally enjoyed at any time of day. \u201cThe dough recipe and most of the recipes for the fillings have been passed down from my grandmother, to my mother, to me, and now to my niece,\u201d says Malushi. \u201cI love them all, but my favorite to this day is spinach and cheese.\u201dMalushi is ethnically Albanian, but was born and raised in Peja, Kosovo (which, by 1963, when she was seven years old, had become an autonomous, majority Albanian province in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia). She recalls a peaceful childhood with people of many backgrounds and religions living together in relative harmony. Though, at that time, Malushi paid no mind to political tensions anyhow\u2014nor did she foresee the conflict that was brewing in the region. \u201cI just wanted to play with my friends and run around outside,\u201d she says. Her father had died suddenly of a heart attack when she was just two years old, and at that time it was customary for a widowed wife to live with her husband\u2019s family. \u201cSo my mother, my two siblings, my grandparents, and my aunt and uncle all lived together in one house, with my grandmother doing most of the cooking,\u201d Malushi explains. \u201cFood was something to be enjoyed.\u201dMagbule Malushi with her children Alida (left), Eduard (middle), and Shqipe (right) in Peja, Kosovo.\nPhotograph courtesy of Alida MalushiFrom her grandmother\u2019s garden, Malushi harvested fresh tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers, spring onions, garlic, spinach, and lettuce\u2014and picked apricots, pears, peaches, quince, and mulberries right from the trees. \u201cCan you imagine that beauty? And to think we lived in a small city,\u201d she says now. Buzzwords like organic and gluten-free and antioxidants didn\u2019t exist in her grandmother\u2019s vernacular. \u201cShe just followed nature and the seasons. Recipes were given without cooking times and measurements. You learned by doing and nothing was rushed; slow food was a way of life.\u201dAfter the death of President Josip Broz Tito in May, 1980, tensions mounted in Yugoslavia that would result in its eventual breakup. By the early \u201990s, Malushi had graduated with a degree in literature and was working as a reporter in the city of Pristina. She watched as nationalism took hold. \u201c[Ethnic] groups start talking against each other and protesting, which proved to be deadly for its former citizens who lived side by side peacefully for many decades,\u201d she says. \u201cNeighbors turned to enemies and you never knew who was listening and would report you to the government as a dissident.\u201dBy 1989, Albanians living in the once again Serbian province of Kosovo began protesting for the return of their constitutional autonomy, which had since been stripped by Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic\u2014a longtime opposer of Muslim Albanians\u2019 demographic control of the area. When Milosevic\u2019s military forced Malushi\u2019s Albanian-run TV station to shutter in 1991\u2014a way for Serbian authorities to \u201cfurther censor\u201d the media, says Malushi\u2014she decided to move to America, where she joined her sister and brother (Tolka\u2019s father), who were both living in New Jersey. New in the U.S., out of work, recently married, and pregnant, Malushi found her new career in the pages of Gourmet magazine with an ad for the French Culinary Institute in Manhattan. She applied to become a professional pastry chef, was accepted, and graduated in 1995\u2014going on to work at various hotels and restaurants before opening her own bakery, Iris, in River Edge, New Jersey in 2002.But two years later, her mother, who had also since relocated to the U.S., fell ill, so Malushi closed Iris to care for her until she passed in 2017. It was then that Malushi's niece, 28 years old and working on brand partnerships at Charity Water, approached her about learning to cook the traditional Albanian foods her aunt and father had eaten as children in Kosovo. \u201cShe [Magbule, Malushi\u2019s mother] was the matriarch of our family,\u201d says Tolka, \u201cand I wanted to find a way to preserve her recipes.\u201d Malushi hadn\u2019t cooked professionally in over a decade when the two began spending their Sundays together making baklava, \u0107evapi, and, of course, burek. \u201cAfter we made the burek, I was like, \u2018Ah, I forgot how good this is!\u2019\u201d Tolka says. \u201cWe realized there was really none like my aunt\u2019s on the market.\u201dA few family tastings later and, during a frosty winter in 2019, the pair decided to start selling their burek under the name Balkan Bites. Tolka managed the business, branding, and marketing, and Malushi developed recipes and oversaw production. They debuted their fresh pastries at local markets in New York City\u2014from the Columbus Circle Holiday Market to the Queens Night Market\u2014where the hot, stuffed phyllo swirls delighted passersby and became an instant hit.Despite the deep historical divisions in former Yugoslavia\u2014and plenty of attempts, according to Malushi, to nationalize cuisines after its various former territories split in the \u201990s\u2014food remained a connective tissue across the Balkan diaspora. \u201cPeople continued sharing their memories and family recipes through cooking websites, TV shows, and books\u2014telling stories of how people once lived together and shared a common life,\u201d Malushi explains, citing the popular Balkan adage \u201cMake burek not war.\u201d \u201cWhen we had our outdoor pop-up events in New York, it was beautiful to see people come together from different countries that were previously at war, talking together and bonding over their shared love of burek.\u201dIn early 2020, Tolka and Malushi had plans to expand into wholesale by selling burek to restaurants and coffee shops. \u201cLittle did we know they were about to close for months due to the COVID-19 lockdowns and outdoor pop-up markets wouldn\u2019t resume for the rest of the year,\u201d Malushi says. \u201cWe felt helpless and didn\u2019t know what to do next.\u201d Then came requests from loyal customers for shipments, and they decided to launch an online store, which turned into their biggest sales channel.My first taste of Balkan Bites came from a four-pack of spinach and cheese burek I scarfed down on a cold, rainy, gray day in April. I dropped one of the frozen, naked-looking disks on a parchment-lined tray and sent it into a hot oven before going about my business. Suddenly my kitchen was filled with the smell of Malushi\u2019s childhood memories\u2014buttery pastry crisping up; cheese softening to a molten, aromatic paste. The phyllo was unimaginably flaky on the outside and warm and stretchy inside, each bite oozing with spinach-flecked ricotta and tangy feta. It\u2019s crazy to think the burek I was eating in my upstate New York apartment was virtually identical to the ones Malushi ate 60 years ago in Kosovo.I asked Malushi why, after years of hard work, she continues to roll out enough dough\u2014hand-stretched so thin \u201cyou can see the table underneath,\u201d as she puts it\u2014for 1,500 bureks every week. \u201cIt\u2019s a popular saying that an immigrant\u2019s refrigerator assimilates last,\u201d she replied. \u201cPreserving something that was done for hundreds of years is important; it\u2019s a way of remembering our past while moving forward and building our future in a new place.\u201dShop Burek:Frozen Spinach and Cheese Burek, 4-Pack$19 at Balkan BitesExplore Bon App\u00e9titCultureRecipes you want to make.
