You can sub one for the other for things that are freshly battered. An air fryer is a glorified convention oven. Anonymous12/29/2021Is there an error here in the amount of liquid? The batter is too thick to coat olives. I had to add more liquid, almost double the amount. Dee CeeHartford, CT12/22/2021The sauce alone is amazing, I now put it on everything.  Get Trader joes fried olives instead! Anonymous12/18/2021I think the dipping sauce is flipping incredible and have already made it a bunch of times. Small complaint - we are salting olives dipped in a salty/spicy sauce? I'm sure it's so that it looks pretty, but it seems insane. AnonymousSan Francisco, CA 12/16/2021I made these olives with an air fryer and was not very impressed. Dipping sauce was so so. I will not be making these again.SeanPort Coquitlam, Canada12/12/2021Has any body tried this in air fryer???Anonymous12/6/2021Calabrian chile pasteKathy CooperSandia Park New Mexico12/4/2021What is a good brand of chili paste to use for this recipe?funk88Houston, TX12/1/2021Gonna try this... got addicted to the ones at OLEABrooklyn Olive BroNYC11/27/2021Explore Bon App\u00e9titSnackStarterEasyVegetarianDairy-FreeNut-FreeOliveOther IngredientsChileVegetableFryChristmasNew Year'sRecipes you want to make.
