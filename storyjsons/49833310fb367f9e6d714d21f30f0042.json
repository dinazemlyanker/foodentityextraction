SauceBy Chris MoroccoJune 2, 20204.3(9)Read ReviewsTriangleEmailPinterestPrintPhotographs by Alex Lau, food styling by Susie Theodorou, prop styling by Aneta FlorczykEmailPinterestPrintEmailPinterestPrintWe adore every steak in the butcher case\u2014but we might love skirt steak the most. (Don\u2019t tell rib eye.) Why? It\u2019s supremely beefy, not outrageously expensive, and, maybe best of all, fast-cooking. It can hold its own but isn\u2019t above being tossed into a roll or stuffed in a taco. And it\u2019s always there when we need it. Oh, and did we mention it goes great with sauce? Sweet, salty, tart, and goosed with secret sources of umami, our new signature sauce is big on flavor, free of weird preservatives, and comes together in about a minute flat.\u00a0Ingredients4 servings  Sauce2Tbsp. balsamic vinegar2Tbsp.

Store airtight at room temperature.Steak and AssemblyStep 3Prepare a grill for medium-high heat; oil grate. Season steak generously with kosher salt and pepper. Grill, turning every 1\u20132 minutes and moving closer to or farther away from heat as needed to build even color, until nicely charred and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of steak registers 125\u00b0(juices pooling on top of meat is a fairly good indicator that meat has reached medium-rare), 7\u20139 minutes. Transfer steaks to a cutting board and let rest 5\u201310 minutes before slicing against the grain.Step 4Transfer steak to plates and top with sauce. Crack some pepper over and sprinkle with sea salt.How would you rate Skirt Steak With BA.1. Sauce?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (5)Back to TopTriangleNot outrageously expensive? That may have been true 40 years ago when butchers threw it into ground beef mixes. If I can find it in meat cases or at butchers, I usually pay quite a premium - more than a choice strip or ribeye per #. But my wife and I love it so we do what we now consider a splurge for special occasions. And it makes the best carne asada too!Ed KLos Angeles8/18/2021First, you have to be into steak sauce. I, for one, was not... until I tried this one. BA has paired it perfectly with the Skirt (or Hanger/Flank or even sirloin -- but I suggest keeping it away from the Strip and Filet. Those should be butter, only). I drizzle a little on the sliced steak and let my guests add more to their liking. It's also an easy sauce to \"make your own\". I added a little Garam Masala, to add some warmth, and it was great. I imagine smoked spices (chipotle, paprika, etc.) would also be very nice. AnonymousWashington DC6/24/2020Came out better than I thought. Kinda yummy actually. Made it and the BA recipe for tri tip steak with tiger sauce tonight.  Was a toss up between the two. It lent a nice change to grilled steak. Not your usual steak salad corn dinner. EssieDeeStamford ct6/21/2020Reverse seared 2 thick NY strips over charcoal. After 10 min rest sliced lengthwise, applied the BA.1. sauce, coarse sea salt & pepper, chopped parsley and topped with sauteed crimini mushrooms.  Awesome. Sauce was great; a little different taste from A1 (that's a positive) and without the goop.AnonymousDestin, FL6/15/2020Was the intent for this sauce to be unpleasantly watery? The consistency bears no resemblance to A.1. or any other traditional steak sauce and feels more like a marinade. A waste of aged balsamic. smithgardnerBrooklyn, NY 6/14/2020Explore Bon App\u00e9titSteakBeefMeatSummerEasyWeeknight MealsQuickMainDairy-FreeGluten-FreeGrillingFourth Of JulyMemorial DayLabor DayDinnerRecipes you want to make.
