Next up is Nina Compton, chef-owner of Comp\u00e8re Lapin and Bywater American Bistro.Nina Compton faced her first kitchen nightmare apprenticing at the Michelin-starred restaurant Daniel: Chef Boulud\u2019s wife had come in for lunch and sent back the goug\u00e8res. As luck would have it, Compton had made them.\u201cI remember everyone in the kitchen stopped what they were doing\u2014separating eggs, weighing flour\u2014and started cursing in French. I prayed the floor would open up so I could disappear,\u201d she recalls. \u201cIt was a crazy moment of failure, but working in a kitchen of that caliber, it was perfection or nothing. Now I just look back and laugh.\u201dAs the James Beard Award-winning chef behind Comp\u00e8re Lapin and Bywater American Bistro in New Orleans, Compton has come a long way from her days of apprenticeship.The 40-year-old St. Lucia native (she\u2019s the daughter of the island\u2019s late Prime Minister Sir John George Melvin Compton) discovered her passion for Caribbean cooking watching her mom and granny at home. She studied at The Culinary Institute of America, apprenticed with Daniel Boulud in New York City, then joined the kitchen crew at Norman\u2019s and Palme d\u2019Or before becoming chef du cuisine at Scott Conant\u2019s Scarpetta in Miami. In 2013, she won second place and fan favorite on Bravo\u2019s Top Chef: New Orleans. \u201cI really think participating in Top Chef changed everything for me,\u201d she says. \u201cI had the opportunity to cook what I wanted, and I really wanted the world to see what Caribbean food is about.\u201dComp\u00e8re Lapin\u2014named after a mischievous rabbit in Caribbean folklore\u2014lures crowds to the industrial space on the ground floor of the Warehouse District\u2019s Old No. 77 Hotel & Chandlery with food celebrating Compton\u2019s Caribbean heritage and French/Italian training. Think snapper escovitch with carrot beurre blanc and the star of the show: tender curried goat with pillowy sweet potato gnocchi buried underneath. Her second restaurant, Bywater American Bistro, is Compton\u2019s take on casual neighborhood dining with comfort food like pickled shrimp with buttermilk and a half chicken with dijon vinaigrette.We talked to Compton about her guilty pleasures, music must-haves, and favorite flavors to play with.The best meal I ever had was\u2026 at Manresa. I really felt a connection with David Kinch through the food. I had abalone and poblano chowder\u2014the layers of flavor were incredible and the addition of abalone dashi was really special.When I want to zone out I\u2026 Play reggae. Whether I\u2019m stressed out and want to zone out or I\u2019m feeling excited and want to go for a walk or bike ride, reggae suits every one of my moods. I love anything by Steel Pulse, Bob Marley, or even Sublime. But when I hear Your House by Steel Pulse, my stress level drops to zero instantly.Growing up in St. Lucia taught me\u2026 how to be humble. It taught me to appreciate where I come from and understand that it\u2019s the little things in life that are so important, like having a mango or avocado tree in your backyard.If I could cook for anyone in the world it would be... My dad and granny who passed away. They were both so instrumental in my love for food and life, and I would love to cook for them one last time. I would make flying fish in parsley sauce, which was my granny\u2019s favorite dish to make when I was growing up, and a one pot stew. My dad would throw everything he could find in a pot and make this delicious stew that we would have for lunch when we went sailing. Both bring back fond memories.My favorite guilty pleasure is\u2026 Forensic Files and a glass C\u00f4tes du Rh\u00f4ne Saint-Cosme at the end of a day.I\u2019m currently listening to\u2026 Oasis, Nightmares on Wax, Kendrick Lamar, Santigold.Food is\u2026 life and happiness.My favorite flavors to cook with are... Indian and African. It\u2019s a history lesson for me and teaches me how things evolved on the islands. There is such a strong influence from India and Africa, not to mention the spices and ingredients are so unique and flavorful.I want people to remember me for\u2026 trying to let people know that Caribbean food is so exciting and you can experience it in such a fun fashionI can\u2019t live without... music, it sets the tone for my day.The biggest challenge of running restaurants is\u2026 consistency. The expectations are high and to deliver each day is very hard and demanding.The most rewarding part of running restaurants is\u2026 seeing my staff that have been with me from day one grow each day. It makes me feel like I did something right.After I won a James Beard award I\u2026 was in the dish pit the very next day!Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishNew OrleansPerson of InterestInterviewsRead MoreLifestyleAdrienne Maree Brown on Why Joy Is a Form of ResistanceBy Maggie LangeRecipes you want to make.
