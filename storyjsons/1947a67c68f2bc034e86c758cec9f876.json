It was cute and all, at least when I lived in a big shared apartment with an open kitchen, to be slicing and dicing and saut\u00e9ing while keeping up banter with my guests. But you know what? Now that I\u2019ve got a one-bedroom and a narrow galley kitchen, I don\u2019t want anyone up in my grill during go-time, asking me what I\u2019m doing or what such-and-such ingredient is. Honestly, that\u2019s kind of my job, and on Saturdays I try to keep the explaining-cooking-stuff-while-sweating thing to a minimum.This is all to say, when I\u2019m planning a menu for a dinner party, I look for dishes that require as little a la minute cooking as possible\u2014things that can be prepped, cooked, and more or less cleaned up hours before anybody walks through the door. Seriously: Nothing makes you feel like a boss quite like sitting at the table with your friends, eating snacks, drinking wine, with the knowledge that you could have dinner on the table in ten minutes, starting whenever-the-hell you want. It\u2019s a powerful, intoxicating secret\u2014I could be wrong, but I\u2019m preeeeetty sure this is what having a concealed firearm feels like.Moooooving on, it is in this spirit that I bring you 2018\u2019s first installment of the $50 Dinner Party: a menu that a) feeds 10, b) costs around $50, and c) you should be able to shop for in the morning (as in 9 a.m., not 11 a.m.), prep over the course of the afternoon, and have everything buttoned up before your friends roll up at 7. Let\u2019s do this.Le Menu:Creamy Kimchi DipCider-Braised Pork Shoulder with Butternut SquashHerby Napa Cabbage Salad with LimeChocolate and ClementinesYou\u2019ll Need:1 6\u20147-pound bone-in pork shoulder (Boston butt), preferably skinless2 medium butternut squash (about 7 pounds total; pick ones that are about the same size)2 cups apple cider or juice\u00be cup low-sodium soy sauce or tamari\u00be cup distilled white vinegar2 heads of garlic6 scallions3 cups short grain white rice1 16-ounce jar kimchi1 8-ounce brick cream cheese1 8-ounce tub sour cream6 Persian cucumbers, or 1 English cucumber1 medium head of Napa cabbage (about 2\u00bd pounds)1 bunch cilantro1 bunch dill2 limesAssuming You Have (Otherwise You\u2019ll Need to Buy):Kosher saltExtra-virgin olive oilBlack pepper\u00bd cup neutral oil (vegetable, peanut, canola, whatever)Ask Your Friends to Bring:1 bag pretzels1 bag sturdy potato chips1 of those cute little cases of clementines or mandarin orangesA bar of chocolate (everyone)Booze (everyone)Dinner Party MarxismFirst things first: Tell your friends what to do. Text everyone and instruct them to bring booze. While I used to get super specific about what kind of wine to bring\u2014light reds, sparkling wine, etc\u2014I\u2019ve changed my tune a bit. Now, I try to be super specific with each guest, to play to their strengths, as it were. Got a couple of friends who like to nerd out on natural wine? Tell them what you\u2019re cooking and let them get weird. Have a friend who is chronically broke and only begrudgingly buys wine when other people tell them to? Have them bring a twelve-pack of shitty beer, for when the wine runs out and nobody cares what they\u2019re drinking anyways. That friend who won\u2019t stop talking about their fancy promotion? A decent bottle of whisky or tequila for when the party really starts to get dark. Think of it as Dinner Party Marxism\u2014 \u201cFrom each according to his ability,\u201d and all that.You\u2019re also going to ask the one friend who you know will show up on time to bring a bag of potato chips and a bag of pretzels to go with the kimchi dip, the one friend who you know is going to show up late and feel guilty about it to bring one of those little cases of clementines, and ask a handful of random, reasonably responsible people to bring bars of chocolate, dealers choice. If this makes you uncomfortable, try listening to the 2006 hit \u201cBossy\u201d by Kelis featuring Too $hort while delegating; I find it helps.Get the Pork StartedThe whole day needs to be organized around that salty-sweet, fall-apart slow-roasted pork shoulder\u2014it\u2019s a big piece of meat, and its timeline is your timeline. Start to finish, you should budget 7 hours. I\u2019m not saying this to freak you out, but if you want to actually experience the euphoric sensation of having everything done by the time your doorbell rings, you need to manage your time accordingly.So here\u2019s the thing about pork shoulder. In its most basic form\u2014bone-in, skin-on, and big\u2014it\u2019s about as cheap a piece of meat as you\u2019re going to get. Most of those are going to clock in at 5-8 pounds, and something on the lower range is definitely going to be enough to feed a group this size, probably with leftovers. The limiting factor is the size of your Dutch oven. I literally measured mine (10.5 inches in diameter, the #29 Le Creuset) and brought a measuring tape to the store to make sure I found one that fit. If you\u2019re working with a smaller pot, plan accordingly\u2014maybe you want a boneless pork shoulder instead, so that you can cut it into a few pieces that will fit into your cooking vessel.Give that pork a good rub down.\nPhoto by Alex LauNow that that\u2019s out of the way, let\u2019s start cooking. Arrange your oven racks so that you\u2019ve got one in the lowest possible position and one in the highest possible position, and preheat that bad boy to 300\u00b0F. Take your 6\u20147-pound bone-in, skinless pork shoulder out of the plastic, put it on a rimmed baking sheet, and rub it all over with 3 tablespoons kosher salt. Let it sit out for at least an hour, allowing the meat to come up to room temperature, which will help it to cook more evenly. In the meantime, deal with the squash.Cut 'em in half, scoop out those seeds, but don't waste a second peeling.\nPhoto by Alex LauDeal with SquashSlice your 2 medium butternut squash (ideally totalling around 7 pounds and relatively the same size and shape) lengthwise, and scoop out the seeds and stringy bullshit with a spoon. (Notice I didn\u2019t tell you to go through the agonizing and stupid process of peeling them. You\u2019re welcome!) Rub them down with a little bit of vegetable oil or olive oil, season them with salt, and arrange them cut side-down on a rimmed baking sheet. Easiest butternut squash prep you\u2019ll ever have to do. Once these guys are cooked and soft, we\u2019re just going to scoop out big irregular chunks of the flesh\u2014leaving that stupid skin behind\u2014and use them as the base for all of our saucy pork business.Butternut squash, all oiled up and seasoned, ready for the oven.\nPhoto by Alex LauDeal with the Pork AgainHas an hour passed yet? It shouldn\u2019t have. (Lulz I am sorry but if it took you a whole hour to cut those squash in half and scoop out the seeds you are probably in over your head with this whole dinner party thing tbh.) Go ahead and get together the ingredients for the pork\u2019s irresistibly salty-sweet braising liquid. Measure out 2 cups apple cider or juice, \u00bd cup low-sodium soy sauce or tamari, and \u00bd cup distilled white vinegar. Slice 1 head of garlic in half crosswise. Good deal.Sear it on all of the sides, people.\nPhoto by Alex LauIt\u2019s searing time. Pat the meat all over with paper towels\u2014you want it as dry as possible. Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in your Dutch oven up over medium-high heat, and when the oil starts to shimmer and smoke, carefully lower the pork shoulder in fatty side-down. Sear the pork on all sides until it is good and dark and crusty\u2014this could take as long as 20 minutes total, be patient! When that\u2019s done, turn off the heat, carefully lift the meat out and onto the rimmed baking sheet, and even more carefully pour off whatever fat is in the bottom of the Dutch oven.Photo by Alex LauPhoto by Alex LauPhoto by Alex LauPut the Dutch oven back on the stove, turn the heat back on to medium, pour in that apple cider-soy sauce-vinegar business, and toss in the garlic. When the liquid gets bubbly, put the pork back in there\u2014fatty side-up this time. Tear off a square of aluminum foil, put it on top of the meat, and kind of tuck it around before putting the lid of the Dutch oven on. (What\u2019s the deal with the foil? IDK, Claire Saffitz told me to, and when she tells me to do something I always do it.) Turn off the heat, transfer the Dutch oven to the bottom rack of your oven, and slide the sheet pan of butternut squash onto the top rack.Congratulations! Your main course is almost entirely done. Well, the \u201cdoing stuff\u201d part of the main course, anyways. The pork is going to take between 3 and 3\u00bd hours total, but you should go ahead and check on everything happening in the oven after an hour and a half or so. At this point, flip the pork, recover it with foil and the lid, and pop it back in the oven. The squash is probably ready to come out by then\u2014a fork should slide easily through the skin and into the flesh\u2014and you can just cover it with foil and let it hang out on top of the stove until game time. As for the pork, stay tuned for further instructions.Prep the SaladTiiiiiiiiiiIIIIIiiiiIIIIIIIIIme, it\u2019s on your siiiIIIiiIIIiiiide, YES IT IS! (Am I still a millennial if I like singing Rolling Stones karaoke? You decide.) Now that the pork and the squash are in the oven, you\u2019ve got some hours on your hands. But if I were you\u2014and the tone and tense of this article kind of assumes that I am, in fact, you\u2014I would go ahead and get the rest of my prep out of the way now. That means getting the salad together, making the dressing, and making that kimchi dip.Before we deal with the salad fixin\u2019s, we\u2019re going to set ourselves up for kimchi dip success by taking an 8-ounce block of cream cheese out of the fridge, cutting it into cubes, and letting it come up to room temperature in a bowl on top of the warm oven. (If the idea of mixing cream cheese and kimchi together sounds gross you to, trust\u2014it did to all of my coworkers too. Until they tried it.)Chop, chop, chop.\nPhoto by Alex LauNow: that salad. The thing that I love about a cabbage salad is how crunchy and sturdy it is. Where lettuce prepped too far in advance can get kinda sad and wilt-y, cabbage holds up like a MF champ\u2014exactly what we want in the context of  this whole get-it-all-done-before-anyone-gets-here thing. Mix it with a ton of herbs and a super zippy, lime-y dressing, and you\u2019ve got yourself the perfect complement to anything rich and meaty. To start, take out 1 medium head of Napa cabbage (about 2\u00bd pounds) and peel off any nasty-looking outer layers. Slice the whole thing in half lengthwise, then each one of those halves lengthwise, and then chop down each quarter crosswise so you have roughly 1\u201d pieces. Transfer that to a salad bowl. Now, that wasn\u2019t so hard, was it?Photo by Alex LauHERB TIME! You know what makes a bunch of chopped cabbage feel less like a bunch of chopped cabbage and more like a salad? A whoooooole lotta herbs. In this case, you\u2019re going to use an entire bunch of cilantro and an entire bunch of dill. That\u2019s correct: The two most controversial herbs in the same damn dish. Edgy, right? I\u2019ve got this theory, which is that when you combine dill and cilantro they stop tasting like dill and cilantro and just taste brilliant and beautiful and green and \u201cherbaceous\u201d\u2014you can feel free to pretend like this is your theory when people say, \u201cHey! I don\u2019t normally even like dill and cilantro but they\u2019re pretty good in this salad!\u201d Or you can take the coward\u2019s way out and use, like, parsley or something instead. Looks like you get to decide which side of history you\u2019re on!In any case, wash and dry 1 bunch of dill\u2014tbh I only do this is they seem very dirty\u2014and  pick the frilly, tender mini-sprigs of dill off of the not-so-tender stems and add them to the salad bowl. Do the same with 1 bunch of cilantro, then cover your salad with a damp piece of paper towel and chuck the whole thing into the fridge for later.Photo by Alex LauOn to the dressing, which I hesitate to call a dressing because of how simple it is. Zest two limes into a measuring cup. Then halve the limes and squeeze them into that same measuring cup. You\u2019ll probably end up with about a \u00bc cup of juice, to which you\u2019ll add some distilled white vinegar until you get \u00bd cup of liquid in there total. Add a big pinch of salt, a bunch of grinds of black pepper. Measure out \u00bd cup of vegetable oil in a separate bowl/cup/mug, cover both in plastic wrap, and set them both aside for later. Done and done!Make Kimchi DipI hold this truth to be self evident: If you mix sour cream and cream cheese together, add something extremely flavorful to that unholy combination\u2014caramelized onions, miso, Buffalo chicken\u2014and season it with salt, you have a Delicious Dip. This is the principle behind this kimchi dip, and I\u2019m going to make you a believer.Remember that cream cheese that you set out a while ago? Put that in a bowl, mash it up some with a rubber spatula, and add an 8-ounce tub of sour cream to it. Mash it up so it is as smooth as possible. Add a pinch of salt and mash some more. The stage has been set for Delicious Dip.Photo by Alex LauPhoto by Alex LauTake out your 16-ounce jar of kimchi\u2014I like to use the spiciest possible Napa cabbage version I can find, but any kind will do\u2014and remove the solids from the jar, trying to leave behind whatever liquid is in there. Give the kimchi a good squeeze over the sink if it seems especially wet. Then chop it up as finely as you can. Add it to that bowl of creamy goodness, along with 1\u00bd tablespoons of low-sodium soy sauce or tamari, and mix the whole thing up good. Delicious Dip, right??? Season with salt if it needs it, transfer it to a Presentable Dip Bowl, cover it with plastic and pop it in the fridge. Slice 6 Persian cucumbers on a jaunty diagonal to use as scoopers, throw those in a Ziplock, toss that in a fridge, and you\u2019re golden.You are so close to having everything done before anyone has arrived, it\u2019s crazy.Ready the Pork!Salad? Check. Salad dressing? Check. Kimchi dip? Check. Now it\u2019s back to the pork situation. By now your butternut squash is probably cooked and out of the oven, and the meat is on its last stint in the oven. At the 3 hour mark, take a peek at the pork. If it\u2019s not pulling away from the bone, looking so tender that it\u2019s about to collapse onto itself, give it another half hour or so\u2014you don\u2019t want to rush this part, or you\u2019re going to be annoyed with yourself later.Done and done.\nPhoto by Alex LauWhen the pork shoulder has gotten to that special, fall-off-the-bone place, take it out of the oven and let it rest, uncovered, for at least an hour. You know how people are always telling you to let meat rest before you cut it up? Well, this is a big ass piece of meat, and it needs plenty of time to rest. Also: You\u2019re going to need to get hands-on with that meat, and if you don\u2019t let it cool down you\u2019re going to burn the shit out of your fingers. Go do something else for an hour!Photo by Alex LauHow was that hour? Good? Take a shower or something? (Read: Scroll through three years of an ex\u2019s Instagram feed.) Great! Time to shred the pork. Take that now-patiently-rested, nearly-falling-apart hunk of meat and transfer it to a platter. Fish the mushy halves of garlic out of the Dutch oven and squeeze the cloves out of their skins and back into the pot, then toss the skins. Now start pulling the meat into bite-size pieces, throwing them back into the cooking liquid in the Dutch oven as you go, discarding any gristle-y pieces, bones, or unappealing hunks of fat in the process. When that\u2019s finished, give that meaty, saucy goodness a taste, and add a splash of vinegar and some salt if it needs it. Put a lid on it, park it on the back of the stove.One last thing. Trim and clean up 6 scallions, and slice them as thinly as possible. Transfer that to a bowl and put it in the fridge.You\u2019ve done it: Dinner is prepped, and you\u2019ve still (hopefully) have hours before anyone is going to show up at your house. Pour yourself a drink and pat yourself on the back.Now do the dishes.Game TimeDING DONG! Look who it is! Your most responsible friend, the one who always shows up exactly on time! Normally this would annoy you, because you\u2019re in the middle of something and were kind of counting on an extra 15 minutes\u2014but not today! You are ready.Heeeeeeeere's KIMCHI DIP!\nAlex LauShow them in, pour them a drink, and set out the bowl of kimchi dip along with the sliced cucumbers and the chips and pretzels they brought. Sit down with them and shoot the shit while the rest of your friends filter in. How good does that feel, knowing that everything is already done? A few of your friends are probably giving you weird looks because they\u2019re used to you scrambling and sweating in the kitchen for the first hour of the dinner party. \u201cSo...what\u2019s for dinner?\u201d They might ask in a leading sort of way, suspicious that you decided to not cook at all and just order pizza. Give them a self-satisfied smirk. Tell them what\u2019s for dinner. Feels good, right? Concealed carry.About a half hour before you want people to sit down, reheat the pork over low heat, covered. You can also pop the butternut squash back into the oven to warm up for a few minutes, but it\u2019s fine at room temp, too. Take the salad out so it\u2019s not fridge-cold.Shreddy, saucy pork, butternut squash, what's not to like?\nAlex LauOnce the table is set and you\u2019re ready to eat, turn off the pork. Turn your attention to the butternut squash. Use a serving spoon to scoop up rough hunks of the cooked squash flesh\u2014leaving behind the skin\u2014and arrange them over the bottom of two large plates or platters. Use tongs to scatter the pork over the squash. Ladle some of that delicious, porky jus out of the Dutch oven and all over the pork-squash business, scatter some scallions on top, and you\u2019re good to go. Ferry those platters out to the table, and bask in the \u201cooooh\u201ds and \u201caaaaaaah\u201ds.Crunch time.\nAlex LauBack to the kitchen. Toss the cabbage and the herbs together with your hands, add in the lime-vinegar dressing and mix again. Add the oil and give it another good toss. Taste it for seasoning, and add a couple of good pinches of salt if it needs it\u2014you really want it to pop. Divide the salad between a couple of large plates or bowls if you feel like it, and bring that salad to the table. More \u201coooh\u201ds and \u201caaaaaaah\u201ds.Eat. Drink. Be merry. Wipe not a bead of sweat from your brow. Is this the easiest dinner party you\u2019ve ever hosted, or what?Nobody is going to get mad at citrus and chocolate.\nPhoto by Alex LauDessertAt some point, when everyone has eaten their fill and heaped praise upon your cooking, make dessert happen. Take a page out of my dear friend Alison Roman\u2019s book here (speaking of books: BUY HER BOOK) and set that crate of clementines right in the middle of the table, and toss those bars of chocolate next to it like you\u2019re dropping the mic.Done. And. Done.Aaaaaaand scene.\nPhoto by Alex LauGet the recipes:Creamy Kimchi DipThis stuff is crazy good.View RecipeCider-Braised Pork Shoulder with Butternut SquashBone-in pork shoulder is one of the least expensive, party-friendly animal proteins you can buy.
