We\u2019re listening, we replied. It would be savory and spicy. It\u2019ll cook much faster than bolognese, but longer than pad kee mao. It\u2019d have an umami hit of tomato paste mixed with spicy sambal oelek, soy sauce, garlic, and ginger. It will be a flavor explosion. We were really listening.A few weeks later, a recipe was born: A quick-cooking (30-40 minutes) red sauce we nicknamed Sambalognese. Sambal-bolognese. (You get it.) At the end of the day, it\u2019s not that close to bolognese, nor is it totally faithful to pad kee mao\u2014hence its Official Name as Spicy-Sweet Sambal Pork Noodles\u2014but one thing is for certain: It\u2019s a simple, flavor-packed, not-so-typical red sauce that\u2019s fast, comforting, and totally addictive. During the testing process, everyone in the office passed by to try a bite. Some were more shameless than others, taking a seat right at the Bon App\u00e9tit Test Kitchen tasting table and making all kinds of obscene moans and groans as they finished every last noodle. Honestly, I can\u2019t even blame them.Here\u2019s how we got here: First, Chris experimented with some fish and oyster sauces, as are used in pad kee mao, to get at that earthy funky flavor, but ground pork ends up adding that on its own. We wanted to keep the ingredient list low, so we cut them. (Fish sauce lovers\u2014you already know this because you do it all the time\u2014feel free to add it back in.) Instead of a fresh Thai chile, we opted for pantry staple sambal oelek because we always have it on hand; it has heat and an extra hint of funk from vinegar (some brands also have fish sauce or shrimp paste in them), so your bases are covered. There\u2019s also basil for a bright green note. (If you can find Thai or holy basil, those are spicier and have more bite than your usual grocery store basil\u2014obviously that would be good here.) Add the soy and ginger, and you get big, punchy flavor fast, which means no need for the hours it takes to develop a deep Sunday sauce.You can serve it with thick spaghetti, fresh ramen or udon, or what I did: Korean rice cakes. I added the tteok directly into the sauce when it was done, with a cup or so of water to rehydrate them. Those starch bombs soaked up the spicy sauce and I loved the bouncy chewy texture against the broken-down tender bites of browned pork. (I was worried my 2-lb. bag of rice cakes would be too much so didn\u2019t use them all, but there was a LOT of sauce\u2014next time I\u2019ll use the whole bag.) I\u2019m eating it for leftovers for lunch today. Like Chris\u2019s reader favorite soy-ginger scrambled eggs, it\u2019s a recipe that keeps you coming back for more.Get the recipe:Spicy-Sweet Sambal Pork NoodlesFull-on explosive flavor in under an hour.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titWeeknightSambal OelekNoodleGround PorkRecipes you want to make.
