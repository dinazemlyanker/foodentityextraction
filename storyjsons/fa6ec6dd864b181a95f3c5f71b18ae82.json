Also toasted and chopped a handful of pistachios, and added a some chopped dates (those two ideas from another BA broccoli recipe). Excellent! AnonymousSugar Hill, NH7/13/2021I made this with jalapenos instead of serranos (I had a bunch to use up), and roasted them first, removing the skins. Served it on a grilled pizza topped with eggplant, onions, bell peppers, and ground beef, all topped with spring greens. So yum!AnonymousNew Jersey 7/7/2019Explore Bon App\u00e9titSauceCondimentHot SauceTahiniCondiments, Sauces & PastesParsleyHerbs & SpicesSerrano ChileChileVegetableSummerEasyQuickDairy-FreeGluten-FreeVeganVegetarianKetoHealthyishRecipes you want to make.
