I thought of it as a special tofu product\u2014that is, until I learned that it is actually just\u2026tofu that has been frozen. D\u2019oh!\u00a0Don\u2019t get me wrong, frozen tofu is still a very special tofu product, just know that you can make it in your kitchen with almost no effort, no special trip to the freezer aisle required. Here\u2019s how (and why) to freeze your tofu.The freezer changes tofu.When frozen, tofu magically transforms\u2014its texture becomes denser and spongier, with tons of little coral reef\u2013like holes. While I hate to spoil the fun, this magic is actually simple science: The water in tofu expands when it\u2019s frozen, thereby destroying the original structure. When the ice crystals thaws, they seep out in the form of water, leaving the holes they formed behind. A star different tofu product with an entirely distinct consistency is born.What\u2019s good about frozen tofu?This change in consistency makes the tofu simultaneously stronger, firmer, and spongier. It holds its shape better when cooked in stir-fries, hot pots, or soups, and loses its tendency to fall apart. Because the tofu has lost water and gained tons of little holes in its place, its mouthfeel is denser with a pleasant bite\u2014some would say it has a meat-like consistency.\u00a0The holes are also perfect pockets for absorbing and storing flavor\u2014like a sponge, frozen tofu is fantastic at soaking up sauces and broths. And, as with anything you freeze, you also extend your tofu\u2019s shelf life\u2014while tofu lasts for weeks unopened in the fridge, it will last for much, much longer in the freezer.How do you freeze tofu?It\u2019s super easy to make frozen tofu at home. Simply cut whole blocks of tofu (any kind works, but be gentle with the silken stuff) into whatever size you plan on using (big or small cubes, thick or thin planks). Carefully place them on a sheet tray or in a freezer-safe container or bag. If you don\u2019t plan on using all of the tofu at once, you\u2019ll want to separate it into portions (use different bags or containers or layer with plastic wrap) so that you can defrost one helping at a time. After your pieces are frozen solid, about 4\u20136 hours, it\u2019s done! Don\u2019t worry if they\u2019ve turned yellow\u2014that\u2019s completely normal. If you froze the tofu on a baking sheet, transfer it to a sealed container\u2014it will last in the freezer for up to one year.Since your frozen tofu is already cut into pieces, you can either throw the cubes or planks directly into what you\u2019re cooking or, if you don\u2019t want excess moisture (say you\u2019re planning to pan-fry, sear, or grill, or you\u2019re simply wary of diluting a broth), you can thaw them before using. There\u2019s no one right way to thaw\u2014either transfer the tofu to the fridge overnight or run the pieces under water.Frozen tofu is great for braising, marinating, or simply adding to soups. And, in my humble opinion, a hot pot spread is simply incomplete without it.
