Among the feisty pet-nats and funky orange wines lurks the more-than-occasional rando red I know retails for $7.99. Sometimes it\u2019s leftover wine from a photo shoot, or something I got for free from an event, or a bottle brought over by a friend who made a very-last-minute run to a grocery store that only sells Chateau Diana \u201cwine product\u201d thinking I wouldn\u2019t notice. (Well, I did notice! You know who you are!!). Regardless: It\u2019s there, for better or for worse.Now, I consider myself a reasonable person. Which means that despite the added sugar and unpalatably high tannins, I\u2019m still able to find value in all things that contain alcohol. So I am here to tell you that yes, you can still drink that bad wine. Maybe not straight from the bottle\u2014I would absolutely not recommend that. But, when poured over ice, topped with a little seltzer (or trendy sparkling beverage of your choosing) and a healthy squeeze of fresh citrus, it can be better than good\u2014it can be great.I\u2019m sure somewhere out there, I am getting kicked out of a cool person\u2019s wine club, but I have to live my truth. And my truth is that sometimes you\u2019re having a dinner party and it\u2019s the end of the night and all you have left is some not-great wine and guess what? It\u2019s not going to drink itself. Plus, is there anything worse than opening up that bottle of chilled gamay you\u2019ve been saving and serving it to someone too drunk to care how naturally fermented it is? No, there is not.Proof!\nPhoto by Alex Lau, Food Styling by Alison Roman, Prop Styling by Kalen KaminskiYou don\u2019t even need a recipe to pull this off in a way that feels thoughtful instead of lazy, just the will to see past the butteriness of an over-oaked chardonnay to the promised land of tart, refreshing wine spritzers. (That\u2019s right, I said it!!) Fill as many tumblers as you have guests with plenty of ice, and pour over whatever \u201cjust okay\u201d or \u201ckind of bad\u201d wine you have lying around\u2014say, three-quarters of the way up a glass. Top with effervescent water\u2014Is it seltzer? Is it club soda? Is it soda water?? Honestly, still struggling to know the difference\u2014and one or two good squeezes of citrus. To really go hi-low here, add a few dashes of Angostura or Peychaud\u2019s bitters, which will tame any undesirable excess sweetness and make you look a bit fancy, then \u201cgarnish\u201d (lol) with some sliced or peeled citrus. Pass around the glasses, and watch the party get a second wind.And there you have it. It\u2019s a cocktail! It\u2019s a spritzer! It\u2019s bad wine, made good.And a batch of cookies, for good measure...Salted Butter and Chocolate Chunk ShortbreadLess chocolate chip cookie, more brown sugar shortbread with chocolate chunks\u2014these cookies have started an Instagram craze.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titBasicallyParty TricksRecipes you want to make.
