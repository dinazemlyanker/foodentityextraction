Take a bite of tomato: it\u2019s good. Now sprinkle some salt and drizzle some olive oil on top and try again: it\u2019s very very good. Same goes for watermelon. Now swap that salt and oil for a piece of feta, which is of course both salty and fatty, and it\u2019s music to your mouth.When I started developing savory melon salads (the best side dish for any grilled food!) for our grilling issue this year, I knew there had to be a watermelon-feta salad. I brought tomatoes into the mix for all the reasons we just discussed, and because I liked the pink and red color combination. I added a turmeric-infused dressing to drizzle over the top to stain the bright white feta yellow (and add a pop of unexpected flavor).To make the turmeric oil oil, I heat virgin coconut oil with lightly crushed peppercorns, coriander seeds, and cumin seeds as well as ground turmeric in a small saucepan over medium until fragrant, then I drizzle it all over a platter of cubed feta, tomatoes, and watermelon. It\u2019s important to make sure the salad is room temperature before you do this\u2014cold ingredients will make that coconut oil seize, like dipping an ice cream cone in a chocolate magic shell. The oil gives the salad some unexpected warmth, spice, and nuttiness, and of course I finish it off with an extra flourish of salt to make sure every flavor pops. It\u2019s a whole new kind of watermelon-feta salad, and I\u2019ll be making it all summer long, from the first baby sungolds to the last hefty heirlooms.Get the recipe:Tomato-Watermelon Salad with Turmeric OilRed, juicy, and sweet, tomatoes and watermelon are soul mates, and they both need salt, spice, and fat to reach their full potential.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishRecipes you want to make.
