It was khichdi, a soul-warming, one-pot meal of rice, lentils, and spices. Easy to make, easy to digest, it\u2019s a common first food for South Asian babies.Khichdi was a constant in my upbringing, mainly made when I was sick. I\u2019d get a sniffle, my mom would take out the pressure cooker, and I knew exactly what she was making for dinner that night. The dish could clear up my sinuses in a single bite.That probably explains why, 28 years on, khichdi remains my ride-or-die comfort food, whether it\u2019s a sick day or not. It\u2019s hard to think of a more wholesome meal that\u2019s also simple and delicious. It\u2019s certainly the dish I would make if I were, you know, stuck at home for days on end, unable to go out to eat at restaurants, relying mostly on my pantry to feed myself. Oh wait\u2026Khichdi is the ultimate pantry dinner. It requires only rice, split mung beans, various warming spices, and ghee\u2014ingredients I always have around and that tend to keep for a while. You\u2019ll find variations on khichdi across the Indian subcontinent \u2014 some versions may add prawns while others swap mung beans for pigeon peas. It has even been adapted beyond the borders of the country\u2014Brits, for example, morphed khichdi into kedgeree, adding smoked fish and egg. You\u2019ll also see it in the world of American wellness bloggers, who have co-opted khichdi, which many mispronounce as\u201ckitch-are-ree\u201d (it should be said like khitch-ree, with a tongue roll on the \u201cr\u201d), for \u201cdetoxes\u201d and \u201ccleanses.\u201dYes, khichdi is good for you\u2014it\u2019s got tons of fiber and protein, and all those spices are very digestion-friendly\u2014but what makes the dish so special is the method of cooking the rice and lentils together in the same pot. The starch from the rice and the potlikker from the lentils merge to create a luxurious consistency that's creamy but with a little texture. The ghee adds richness, and the spices punctuate each bite.In the version I make at home, there are two starring elements. The first is peppercorns\u2014I love the way they tenderize in the pot and give the dish a kick. The second is the chhonk, the ghee-sizzled spices that are poured in at the end. The finishing hit of crunch and fat is so satisfying. Sometimes I\u2019ll add a splash of coconut milk as the dish is coming together for an even creamier texture, or a bag of frozen spinach for bonus roughage. You can crown your bowl with a fried egg, or some chopped herbs. For crunch, you can crumble up pieces of pappadum, a crispy lentil cracker, on top.It\u2019s this one-pot-infinite-possibilities trait that makes khichdi, in times like these, the dish that I find myself returning to at least once a week. When I can\u2019t go outside, when I can\u2019t dine out, when the grocery store has been out of toilet paper for the last three weeks, I know that I can simmer some combination of rice and lentils and spices in a pot, and at the very least, that\u2019s going to turn out okay.Get the recipe:KhichdiView RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titNever FailRecipes you want to make.
