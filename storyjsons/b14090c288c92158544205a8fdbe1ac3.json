It\u2019s a strong lineup this sweltering summer, from coffee boba ice cream to vegan ice cream bon bons to a tangerine take on Creamsicles (my favorite). Stock your freezers, keep your body dry to avoid fungal infection, and snack through the heat with the help of Mr. Joe and yours truly, offering my honest reviews of what\u2019s new, below.Several SaucesOrganic Spicy Honey SauceAfter diving into honey recently, I learned that Brazil, Mexico, and Hawaii are the only sources of organic honey right now. It\u2019s really hard to tell bees what to pollinate! Anyway. The honey is dark and tastes of molasses and Back Cherry White Claw someone left in your fridge (for a reason), while the spice seems to exist only to cover up the meh honey. Sorry Joe, I\u2019m sticking with Mike\u2019s.Related: The Snack Queens With Alex Beggs and Andrea HernandezContentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Dill Pickle MustardAs delicious as it is genius.Chile Lime MayoAs disappointing as it was promising.Bloody Mary SalsaBloody Mary but make it chunky. This doesn\u2019t feel right to me without vodka in a pint glass with a toothpick loaded up with mortadella, ambiguous cheese blocks, and jumbo green olives. But if you l-o-v-e horseradish, go for it.A Single Wedge of CheeseMobay CheeseI was constantly presented with comparisons to my own sweating body this month, and this precipitous cheese was one of them. She sweats. But the mild, creamy goat\u2019s milk cheese is a great intro to goat\u2019s milk cheese that isn\u2019t a log covered in blueberry jam. The varicose blue vein of ash down the center is for show, and show it does, but you won\u2019t taste anything. A good cheese with subtle notes of bahhh. Will bahhh again.Drinkable LiquidsSparkling LemonadeThis is the adult mixer you\u2019ve been waiting for. Sparkly, acidic, sweet. This + tequila would be a sunny, easy cocktail. It\u2019s got enough sugar to rot my teeth and awaken the diabetes gene swimming around my bloodstream\u2014but damn, it\u2019s tasty.Ultra-Filtered Reduced Fat MilkA clever rebranding of lactose-free milk. I remember my grandparents\u2019 fridge always having a clinical carton of Lactaid, a bottle of white grape juice, and a bottle of purple grape juice, and even preteen me knew I was being presented with three terrible refreshment options. This is lactose-free milk. I foamed it up for a cappuccino and couldn\u2019t tell the difference between this and lactose-full milk. Yay?Wheat and Sugar AlternativesCauliflower Pizza CrustThere\u2019s cheese in it! These are delicate and tend to crack and crumble when woman-handled, but the fact that they\u2019re laced with Parmesan makes me a forgiving customer. I air-fried one and it burnt around the edges before getting crisped up anywhere else, but I really like this as a wheat alternative. (FWIW it\u2019s much better than the gaseous cauliflower thins.) I cut it into wedges and served it with every dip in the fridge for Dip Lunch. I suppose you could make a pizza with it, but I don\u2019t think the crust can really hold up much\u2014baker beware.Allulose Sweetener BlendA low-cal not-sugar that you can put in your body, if you choose to.Chips and FriendsCrispy Peanut Butter Filled Milk Chocolate PeanutsNow THESE are a good time. Heavy on the chocolate coating, but innovative and only slightly melted, misshapen, and lumpy. They\u2019re shaped like cartoon peanuts and that\u2019s funny. Is this what a trompe l\u2019oeil is? I dunno, I took French in a two-week intensive that NYU should refund me for. Little pieces of crispy rice in the PB filling give your teeth something to look forward to.Almond Butter Filled Pretzel NuggetsEven better than the peanut butter ones, which was heretofore thought to be impossible. Salty, thick pretzel exterior and soft almond butter inside. I make an after-school snack bowl with a handful of these and some cut strawberries. Let life be this simple.Everything But the Bagel Seasoned Kettle-Cooked Potato ChipsSome chips are huge, huge! And I never trust a giant chip. These give you onion breath so rank you\u2019ll want to brush your teeth, clear your Chrome history, and go to church to cleanse your soul from the outside in. Does \u201cEverything\u201d seasoning need to be sprinkled on everything? Too much of a good thing can be exhausting.Rosemary SfloglietteHas little air bubbles that have broken off and left craters like acne scars. Good, sturdy, and bite-size. Some might say they\u2019re even better than Carr\u2019s rosemary crackers. Others might say Carr\u2019s are butterier, and that counts for something. You decide.Frozen ThingsCookies & Creme Bon BonsA coconut milk-based (so, vegan!) ice cream speckled with memories of past cookies enclosed in a thin chocolate globular shell. Love \u2019em. They\u2019re handheld and packaged in a jewelry box that cradles each globe in its own compartment. Every time I open it I think about what else I can put in the container when the bon bons are gone gone, and that\u2019s the kind of future-looking, optimistic mindset that gives life a sense of purpose and continuity. Hair ties. Maybe I\u2019ll put hair ties in it.Ube Ice CreamBetween this and the ube tea cookies and the ube pancake mix, it\u2019s clear that JoeCorporate got a good deal on a vat of purple yam pur\u00e9e. It\u2019s toasty, almost coconutty, and supremely creamy. A+Cold Brew Coffee & Boba Coconut Non-Dairy DessertI am shocked, shocked, that the boba holds up in this. The tapioca pearls are the size of peas\u2014 they might even be triangles?\u2014but they\u2019re chewy as they should be and a complete delight in this coffee ice cream. This is worth the hype\u2026Tangerine Cream Bars...but these are my favorite of the frozen lineup this summer. I can\u2019t have coffee ice cream after 2 p.m. I\u2019m 33! And I\u2019m easily agitated. But these not-Creamsicles don\u2019t interrupt my biological clock. The tangerine exterior is slightly acidic and tart while revealing creamy vanilla ice cream within. At its core, it\u2019s basic. Maybe that\u2019s why I like it so much.Non-Dairy Frozen Dessert Chocolate Fudge Oat BarsRich, deep chocolate-flavored oat milk ice cream that has a chewy texture. Give it a whirl.Peruvian Bay ScallopsScallops packaged in a SpongeBob motif that makes them seem FUN and KOOKY. Love a kooky scallop. Fry \u2019em in lemony brown butter, make some noodles, and watch Columbo on Mom\u2019s Amazon Prime.Sweet SnacksChile-Spiced PineappleHits that craving for mangonada or Taj\u00edin-topped [any fruit]\u2014gimme that sweet heat (oh, hi Rick!). The coating of chili powder is almost gritty, like eating sand at the beach, in a good way. My favorite thing about these chewy dried pineapple rings is that one is enough; I don\u2019t plow through the whole bag when I\u2019m proctrasti-snacking.Dark Chocolate Watermelon SticksEwwwie. These are a crime. A log of sticky watermelon jelly is enclosed in bitter dark chocolate. I can\u2019t believe this was someone\u2019s idea of a good time. It\u2019s a BAD TIME. I would say \u201cavoid these like the plague,\u201d but from what I\u2019m seeing, people don\u2019t do that anymore. They seem to actually run toward the plague now. Baffling. All of it.This Peach Walks Into a Bar\u2026Gluey.Organic Dark Chocolate Half-Coated Rice Cake ThinsThis is one of the \u201chealthy\u201d snacks that I\u2019m getting sold on TikTok from diet influencers, in between all the FUPA-targeted workouts. What can I say, I\u2019m an open book. So I talked myself into thinking edible corrugated cardboard would be a nice little afternoon treat, but objectively, it was kind of sad.Organic Brown Rice Cake ThinsSomehow sadder.Citrus Mousse CakesTJ\u2019s makes these mousse cakes in different flavors to match the seasons, and they\u2019re always great because they have this fluffy, cloudlike mousse inside. It\u2019s a little lemon-shaped petits fours and, OMG, so cute.Tangy Turtles Tart & Sweet Gummy CandyAll of these taste like lime flavor with a spirulina chaser. Not my favorite gummies at TJ\u2019s, and not actually tart/sour/tangy. But you can wear a turtle as a ring and propose to your playground girlfriend with it, so it has that going for it.Canned SnacksQuinoa-Stuffed DolmasThe quinoa filling is a decent idea but in desperate need of seasoning (except Everything But the Bagel seasoning, anything but that!). Dunk these in your yogurt dipping sauce of choice to make up for it.Cookies!Strawberry Shortcake Sandwich CookiesA sickening sweetness saturates the senses.Ube Tea CookiesI pop a few of these in the afternoon. They\u2019re button-size powdered sugar cookies like Mexican wedding cookies or Snowballs or whatever you call them. The subtle, nutty ube flavor goes brilliantly with bracing cold brew.
