Shaved into thin slices, raw cauliflower provides excellent texture and structure, while crisp Asian pears bring a sweet-tart flavor with lovely floral notes. A bright citrusy dressing clings to every nook and cranny thanks to creamy peanut butter for just-enough thickness. When Som was growing up, Asian pears were a treat usually found in Chinatown (and instantly recognizable by their little foam-mesh protective sweaters) but now are more widely available. If you can\u2019t find them, Bosc pears are a good substitute.For the rest of Som\u2019s Thanksgiving menu, see his recipes for Roasted Brussels Sprouts With Gochujang Brown Butter, Sweet Potato Tian, Dutch Oven No Mai Fan, Char Siu Wellington, and Milk Tea Bread Pudding With Cr\u00e8me Anglaise.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

I will try chopping peanuts and sprinkle them over salad.Lady arieOlympia, WA12/28/2021Crunchy indeed, but I needed to add a lot more acid and cilantro to brighten the salad up. Asian pears and raw cauliflower aren\u2019t super flavorful in their own, and the peanut dressing was velvety, but I would have preferred something more punchy.  I tried making the peanut topping three times but am not sure it came out like it should have. The peanuts were soft but I was expecting crunchy.
