Going to the farmers\u2019 market is the time to be shamelessly superficial, picking these up in place of the more commonplace varieties at the supermarket. They\u2019re equally delicious and infinitely more stunning. This recipe is part of the Healthyish Farmers\u2019 Market Challenge.

Leave remaining radishes whole if small, or slice in half or into wedges if larger and place in same bowl.

Add lemon juice to bowl and finely grate half of cheese over radishes; toss well to coat. Using a fork, crumble remaining cheese into bowl. Add basil and 2 Tbsp. oil and toss again. Taste and season with more kosher salt if needed.Step 2Transfer salad to a platter.

I needed less Parmesan than called for, leaving me plenty to make more of this salad tonight! Everyone said this was the best salad I'd made in a while and I make salads nearly every day, always varying my ingredients.AnonymousNorthern Minnesota8/4/2021I've made this multiple times.  It's best with early spring radishes.  If the radishes are too old it's not as appealing.  I am not a radish fan but when I make this in Feb or March for my husband who is I also love it.JenniferCA3/1/2021Explore Bon App\u00e9titSaladAmericanCalifornia CuisineRadishVegetableBasilHerbs & SpicesSpringSummerSideVegetarianNut-FreeGluten-FreeKetoHealthyishEasterFourth Of JulyMemorial DayLabor DayRecipes you want to make.
