Spicy. Bacon. What\u2019s not to like? This recipe is clutch for a brunch party because the bacon can be cooked most of the way, held on baking sheets, then glazed and reheated right before everyone sits down.Ingredients10 servings2\u00bdlb. bacon slices (about 40)\u00bccup pure maple syrup1Tbsp. low-sodium soy sauce or tamari1Tbsp. SrirachaPreparationStep 1Arrange racks in upper and lower thirds of oven; preheat to 400\u00b0. Arrange bacon in a single layer on 2 foil-lined rimmed baking sheets (it\u2019s okay if strips overlap slightly; they\u2019ll shrink as they cook). Bake, rotating pans back to front and top to bottom halfway through, until bacon is browned but not quite crisp, 16\u201318 minutes. Let cool 5 minutes. (You can also let cooked bacon rest on pans at room temperature up to 2 hours.)Step 2Whisk maple syrup, soy sauce, and Sriracha in a small bowl to combine. Using tongs, turn bacon on pans. Using a pastry brush, brush bacon on one side with glaze. Return to oven and bake, rotating pans back to front and top to bottom halfway through, until bacon is crisp, 10\u201315 minutes (time will vary depending on your preferred level of crispiness).How would you rate Maple-Sriracha Glazed Bacon ?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (1)Back to TopTriangleI recently found Bon Appetite test kitchen and love it!!
