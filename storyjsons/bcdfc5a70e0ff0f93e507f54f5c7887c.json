It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.[Crickets]Is anyone even reading this thing? It\u2019s a holiday weekend and hopefully you\u2019re at the beach, or inside a freezing movie theater, or hosting an illegal lemonade stand. I won\u2019t tell! And since no one\u2019s looking, I put together a brief summer mood board for this week\u2019s newsletter. Nothing links back to a Bon App\u00e9tit recipe, or teaches you a cooking tip, or reveals which BA staffer is a snow-cone-hating monster. And I definitely wrote this in the bathtub.
