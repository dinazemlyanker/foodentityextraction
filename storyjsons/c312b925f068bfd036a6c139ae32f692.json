(Mantou are plain, soft steamed breads,\u00a0whereas\u00a0bao are stuffed\u2014often made with a char siu filling or served with roast duck instead of pancakes.) Mantou make for a great snack, a quick breakfast, or\u00a0an\u00a0accompaniment to a large banquet meal. They have a craveable, balanced sweetness, but my favorite trait is the texture: pillowy soft, light, and fluffy.For this recipe, which is from my restaurant,\u00a0Mister Jiu\u2019s in San Francisco,\u00a0and pulled from the cookbook, we add milk and cream, which cut through the gluten, giving\u00a0the mantou\u00a0an even more tender crumb than the classic versions. It\u2019s calibrated for the fluffy, low-gluten flour we source from Hong Kong that\u2019s milled for just these types of steamed applications. You can substitute cake flour, like King Arthur\u2019s unbleached, at home, but you may need a few spoons more of it if the dough feels too wet. \u2014Brandon JewAll products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Combine milk, cream, and \u00bc cup water in a measuring glass or small bowl. Reduce speed to low and, with motor running, gradually pour in milk mixture and mix until dough forms a ball, about 2 minutes. If dough has not formed a ball by then, gradually add more flour a teaspoonful at a time until it does. Continue to mix until very smooth, about 8 minutes more. (Alternatively, you can mix in a medium bowl with a wooden spoon or your hands until a shaggy, loose dough forms, then turn out onto a clean surface and knead until smooth and glossy, about 10 minutes. Place in a large bowl to rise.) Remove bowl from mixer and cover with a damp kitchen towel. Let dough rest until slightly puffed, 30\u201360 minutes.Step 2Meanwhile, cut out thirteen 3\"-squares of parchment paper.Step 3Portion dough into 13 equal-size pieces (use a scale if desired). Roll each into an 8\"-long rope. Tie each rope into a knot and tuck the end that came through the knot underneath the bun. Tuck the other end up and over the top. Place buns on parchment squares as you go.Step 4Cover buns loosely with damp kitchen towel and let rise in a warm place until slightly puffed and marshmallow-y in texture, 30\u201345 minutes.Step 5Pour water in a wok or large pot to come 1\"\u20132\" up sides. Set a steamer with a lid over wok, leaving at least \u00bd\" of space between the inside layer of steamer and water. Bring water to a boil over medium-high heat.\u00a0Step 6Place as many buns as will fit in steamer, spacing about 2\" apart. Cover and steam until cooked through, about 8 minutes. Transfer mantou to a plate. Repeat process with remaining buns, adding more water to wok as needed. Serve warm.Do ahead: Mantou can be steamed 2 months ahead. Freeze on a baking sheet until solid, then transfer to resealable plastic freezer bags or airtight containers and keep frozen. To serve, thaw in refrigerator overnight, then re-steam 3 minutes.Reprinted with permission from \u2018Mister Jiu\u2019s in Chinatown: Recipes and Stories from the Birthplace of Chinese American Food\u2019 by Brandon Jew and Tienlon Ho, copyright \u00a9 2021.
