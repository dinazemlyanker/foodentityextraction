It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.Big bowlWhat am I making for the Super Bowl?

Sign up for our newsletter!Soup, good\u201cGazpacho can\u2019t be number two,\u201d Christina Chaey scolded me. She helped me shape my hard-hitting, controversial speech performed at Bon App\u00e9tit\u2019s live podcast this week called \u201cSoups, Ranked.\u201d So what? I like gazpacho! I moved it to number four. It\u2019s so acidic and refreshing. After declaring an unpopular opinion about chicken noodle (dumb soup), I sprinted offstage. An audience member tapped my arm: \u201cBut have you ever had tomato soup with grilled cheese dipped in it?\u201d she pleaded. Then Adam interviewed my hero Stella Bugbee; Priya Krishna and Jia Tolentino read beautiful essays; and a Test Kitchen competition game show had us SCREAMING about how to pronounce paprika. Keep an ear out for when the episode airs here, soon!Get the recipe for a Good Soup: Instant Pot Split Pea SoupGet mad at me here: Soups, RankedPhoto by Alex Lau, food styling by Sue LiPocket full o\u2019 polentaI bought a giant bag of polenta to make lemon polenta cookies from Pastry Love over the holidays (fantastic cookbook AND cookies), but only used a \u00bc cup. Since then, I\u2019ve become obsessed with making oven polenta for dinner using a method Carla Lalli Music taught me that goes something like this: boil 5 cups of water in a Dutch oven, whisk in polenta, put the top on and move it to a 325\u00b0 oven for 40 minutes. When the timer buzzes, stir in half a stick of butter (rounding up, Carla) and too much parmesan and pepper. Done! Then roast broccoli and mushrooms, bake some Trader Joe\u2019s chicken-less tenders, do whatever you gotta do. That will go on top of the polenta all week.Claire Saffitz had a similar recipe a few years ago: Oven Polenta with Roasted Mushrooms and ThymePhoto by Laura MurrayNo meat zoneSpeaking of those chicken-less tenders, I tried all of Trader Joe\u2019s meat imitators over a period of three days for a Healthyish article. By my final bite of an oddly firm but gelatinous not-turkey roast, I needed to chug a gallon of water. Because most of these meatless wonders are PACKED with sodium. (And preservatives, and rando starches, and plastic packaging). Use sparingly. While their Beyond Burger-esque burger is the biggest and newest accomplishment, my favorite product was the soy chorizo. That\u2019s the only one of these I\u2019ll buy again. Otherwise, I\u2019m sticking to plant-based plants.Read it: All the Meat-Substitutes at Trader Joes, RankedPhoto by Gentl & HyersHa ha haThis is an entire experiment about how when we fart, our clothes act as a filter that keeps fart bacteria from escaping into the room and spreading bacteria. \u201cOur final conclusion? Don't fart naked near food,\u201d write some actual scientists. Noted. Hat tip to my friend Christina who shared this on Facebook, a popular social medium.Get the recipe: Brothy Heirloom Beans with CreamNot enough sauceOld Bay announced a limited-edition hot sauce that sold out in an hour. On Brad Leone\u2019s Instagram story, \u201cplease hook me up haha\u201d was a plea for a sample. Shameless, Brad! (Whispers: I want sooome.)Quota fulfilledWe said goodbye to digital director Carey Polis this week, who\u2019s moving to D.C with her fam. Carey hired me at Bon App\u00e9tit a few years ago and I\u2019ll never forget the most important advice she gave me. \u201cYou get one, Beggs,\u201d she warned. She meant I could only compare food to a human toenail once. Thanks for looking out, Carey!!! Gonna miss ya.Unnecessary food meme of the weekUnnecessary food feud of the weekAlex LauIt\u2019s STATUS CITRUS season, folks. You know what that means: $2 Sumo oranges tempting us with their booblike shapes. And my Christmas gift of 10 lbs. of Ojai tangerines arriving on my doorstep, weeeee! Everyone in the BA offices is walking around with orange hands (as you may remember, an unfortunate side effect), and one person in particular is WHINING about SEEDS. That\u2019s Alex Delany, who prefers his citrus seedless. \u201cWe live in 2020\u2014no need for seeds here,\u201d he campaigned. \u201cLet\u2019s keep pushing society forward.\u201d I rescinded my offer of a tiny, juicy, impossibly sweet tangerine\u2014packed with seeds. Jesse Sparks and Emily Schultz booed, \u201cWE HATE SEEDS.\u201d From an office, Meryl Rothstein shouted out her love for farmers\u2019 market grapes, which usually have seeds. \u201cI don\u2019t enjoy seeds,\u201d confessed Christina Chaey, \u201cbut they help me from overeating grapes.\u201d Chaey, what?!? In what Bacchanalian situation are you GORGING on GRAPES? Sarah Jampel is Team Seeds Are Fine. Aliza Abarbanel had thoughts. \u201cIf you complain about seeds in a good orange you are a wimp,\u201d she said. \u201cOranges take work! You have to peel them and you might get a seed but that\u2019s part of the deal! Nobody complains about cherry pits!\u201d EXACTLY.Make the beautiful recipe pictured above: Citrus and Avocado Salad with Orange WaterExplore Bon App\u00e9titBeggs NewsletterSuper BowlRead MorecultureI Made BA\u2019s Best Banana Bread and It Was Indeed the BestBy Alex BeggscultureMake Chicken Meatballs for the SoulBy Alex BeggscultureMy 2019 \u201cKeeper\u201d Recipe Is Never Leaving My SideBy Alex BeggscultureSoups, RankedBy Alex BeggsRecipes you want to make.
