Follow her progress on Instagram @PKgourmet.Like any American family, the Krishnas take weekend breakfast very seriously. When I was a kid, it was not uncommon for us to sit down on Saturday mornings to a spread of chocolate chip pancakes, or toast with Heinz baked beans spiked with chaat masala and tomatoes, or sabudana (a.k.a. savory, peanut-lime tapioca pearls). But when we had family or friends in town, my mom upped the breakfast ante. Visiting guests meant we\u2019d get to eat dahi toast.\u201cDahi\u201d means yogurt in Hindi, and \u201ctoast\u201d is the word my family and many other Indians use to describe cooked sandwiches, so the dish roughly translates to \u201cyogurt sandwich.\u201d But that sounds like the biggest undersell of one of the many favorite foods in the world.Think of dahi toast like a fancier, more interesting grilled cheese. But not in the sense of, like, a truffled grilled cheese (who actually asked for that?) or a grilled cheese that involves, like, six kinds of expensive Gouda. The main event with dahi toast is the yogurt (Greek or strained yogurt, regular will be too runny) mixed with half an onion (finely diced), a minced chile (we use harimirch but a serrano or Thai chile also works), and a handful of finely chopped cilantro. That\u2019s slathered between two pieces of sourdough bread and griddled with a little oil on medium heat until the outsides are golden and the yogurt turns thick and ricotta-like (no cheese pull here, folks). Top it off with a drizzle of crunchy mustard seeds and curry leaves tempered in oil to get the crispy coating that mayo gives a grilled cheese. It\u2019s spicy, it\u2019s tangy, it\u2019s got lots of great textures, and actually, comparing it to a grilled cheese sandwich (which, don\u2019t get me wrong, I love!) doesn\u2019t actually do it justice. Sinking my teeth into the crusty, oiled-up bread with the thick, onion-flecked yogurt makes me feel things.Curry leaves and mustard seeds tempered in oil, aka tadka.\nPerhaps you\u2019re wondering: where did this notion of putting YOGURT, of all things, between bread come from? My mom first tried a variation of this dish at a friend\u2019s house, where it was the go-to weekend breakfast. Both my parents loved the dahi toast so much that my mom immediately had to recreate it at home.What sets mom\u2019s version apart from her friend\u2019s (and other versions I\u2019ve seen on food blogs) is the inspired decision to use sourdough bread, which she discovered it on a California trip in the \u201980s and forever changed the course of our bread consumption. The pleasant tang of sourdough (thick slices are key) is the perfect partner to the heat of the green chilies and the richness of the yogurt and spices. Don\u2019t make this with anything else.The only controversial aspect of dahi toast in our family is the condiments. My dad and I firmly believe that Heinz ketchup, in all its tart, sweet, glossy glory, is the proper pairing. My mom and my sister on the other hand, will dip their dahi toasts in cilantro chutney\u2014they want that extra boost of herbs and heat. A few years ago, my dad discovered the condiment compromise that is Heinz ketchup swirled into cilantro chutney, and I\u2019m certainly not mad about that, either (though the dirt-like color isn\u2019t great).See what I mean about the ketchup/chutney combo.\nDahi toast is no longer just a breakfast dish in our family. It has spilled over into lunchtime, dinnertime, snack time, party time (cut your dahi toast into mini triangles!) and everything in between. At my apartment, the dish is my entertaining magic trick. It looks and tastes so complex, but doesn\u2019t really require a recipe. Best of all, it ultimately takes the effort of, well, making a grilled cheese to produce. But it tastes ten times better.Explore Bon App\u00e9titIndianishToastYogurtRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
