She\u2019d fry up these crispy, sweet fritters anytime there was a ripe banana around, so during quarantine I called her for the recipe. When I make kolar pitha now, it transports me back to her kitchen, which is exactly where I need to be.\u201d Traditionally these banana fritters are sweetened with a syrup made from gur or jaggery, which gives them a musky aroma and a dark brown color. This version uses maple syrup, which hits many of the same notes as those sweeteners.IngredientsMakes 201very ripe medium banana1large egg\u00bdcup (150 g) pure maple syrup\u00becup (120 g) stone-ground rice flour (preferably Bob\u2019s Red Mill)\u00bdtsp. Diamond Crystal or \u00bc tsp. Morton kosher salt\u00bctsp. baking powder1\u20132cups ghee or vegetable oilPreparationStep 1Blend banana, egg, and maple syrup in a blender until smooth, about 15 seconds. Add rice flour, salt, and baking powder and blend again until fully incorporated, about 10 seconds. (Or mash banana with a fork and whisk with the other ingredients in a medium bowl.) Cover batter and let sit at least 20 minutes and up to 2 hours to allow rice flour to hydrate.Step 2Set a wire rack inside a rimmed baking sheet and line rack with paper towels. Pour ghee into a small high-sided skillet, preferably cast-iron, to come at least \u2153\" up the sides (more fat will result in rounder fritters). Heat over medium-high until an instant-read thermometer registers 350\u00b0 or fat rapidly sizzles when a dollop of batter is added to the pan, about 5 minutes.Step 3Using a 1 Tbsp. measuring spoon, drop batter straight down into skillet in a compact circle. Fry 4\u20136 fritters at a time, depending on the size of your skillet, until edges are dark brown, centers puff up, and fritters are mostly cooked through, about 2 minutes. (Initially edges will curl up and centers will look sunken and wet, but don\u2019t worry.) Using 2 spoons or chopsticks, turn fritters and fry until other sides are dark brown, about 1 minute. Using a slotted spoon, transfer to prepared rack and let drain. The fritters will feel soft right out of the oil, but they will grow crisp as they sit. Remove any loose bits of batter from the oil and check the temperature before frying the next batch. Serve hot.How would you rate Kolar Pitha?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (7)Back to TopTriangleI just made these today, followed the recipe exactly, but changed up the technique a bit, as I didn\u2019t want to deep fry.  I used an aebelskiver pan with 1/4 teaspoon of ghee in each divot.  Poured in the tablespoon of batter into each divot and used a wooden skewer to turn each as they cooked on the bottom.  The result was a crispy exterior with a pancake-like interior.  Delicious.  Next time, however, I will reduce the amount of maple syrup - these were on the cusp of being too sweet with 1/2 cup of maple syrup in them.Lisa SPortland, OR4/28/2021I\u2019ve made these twice now - SO GOOD!!!
