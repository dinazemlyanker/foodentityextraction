And if it\u2019s not on their shelf, it\u2019s definitely on their mother\u2019s shelf, or their mother\u2019s shelf. Ring a bell? How about Chicken Marbella? If you\u2019ve ever had the famed olive and prune dish, then you know what we\u2019re talking about.Co-authored by Sheila Lukins and Julee Rosso, the first edition of the unassuming soft-cover cookbook debuted in 1982 and introduced American home cooks to simple, approachable, super flavorful dishes that drew on a global palate, while remaining familiar and accessible. It was an immediate hit. Sure the approach sounds like a given today, but Silver Palate was ahead of its time; almost 40 years later, it hasn\u2019t lost an ounce of its relevance.As winter only continues to get worse (when did polar vortex become a regularly recurring season?) we\u2019re using our monthly Cookbook Club as a chance to turn back to comforting classics while we wait for bright green things (ramps! Peas!)  to return to the market. And if we\u2019re going to use February as an excuse to get nostalgic, then there\u2019s no better place to start than the Silver Palate.Everyone at BA has their favorite recipe from the book, but for me, it\u2019s all about the sour cream coffee cake: the single most important thing I eat all year. It all goes down on Christmas morning (and only on Christmas morning!) as an accompaniment to my family\u2019s very over-the-top gift-giving ritual. Not one of us can recall when or why this tradition began, but I do know that it\u2019s not time to rip apart some shiny paper if the scent of this impossibly moist, perfectly sweet pecan-studded cake isn\u2019t already wafting through the house.So take my word for it, grab some friends, and join us in honoring this timeless classic at your own Cookbook Club this month. Just be sure that coffeecake makes an appearance at the table. You can be very certain I\u2019ll be bringing it to ours.Get the recipe:Sour Cream Coffee CakeThis elegant, moist cake is ideal for serving at a large brunch party or with your morning coffee.View RecipePick up a copy of The Silver Palate Cookbook wherever you buy cookbooks.
