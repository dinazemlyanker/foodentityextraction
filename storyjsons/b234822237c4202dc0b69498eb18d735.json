It is the only thing on the menu that does not change. And if you ask Gabe Moya, the chef de cuisine of this unusual little corner cafe\u0301 in Chicago\u2019s Logan Square neighborhood, what he thinks about it, oh, he\u2019ll tell you.First of all, despite the fact that he grew up in Puerto Rico, Moya is \u201cnot a custard person,\u201d doesn\u2019t even like flan\u2014\u201cand that\u2019s what the quiche is: a pie.\u201d Second: \u201cIt has, like, 900 calories per slice, and that\u2019s not counting the brise\u0301e.\u201d (He calculated this once.) Third, and most important: It bears little relation to the type of cooking\u2014built around whatever vegetables are available and whatever others have fermented long enough\u2014that Moya\u2019s actually interested in. \u201cAny time there\u2019s a write-up,\u201d he says, taking a paring knife to the wilty stalks of a cardoon, \u201cit\u2019s just bread, butter, quiche.\u201dThe now legendary quiche, served with a little pile of greens from Three Sisters Garden in Kankakee, Illinois.\nPhoto by Alex LauCellar Door bakes four quiches a day (five on weekends), each of which is divided into ten slices. \u201cI think we could probably sell more?\u201d says Tony Bezsylko, one of the owners, in the form of a question, as if he\u2019d never thought about it before. \u201cBut no one is going to have a good time making more quiche than that,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat you\u2019re doing is not terribly engaging\u2014you\u2019re buzzing milk, cream, and eggs.\u201d Also: \u201cYou don\u2019t want to taste tons of dairy all the time.\u201dThe quiche is based on Thomas Keller\u2019s recipe from Bouchon Bakery, which another of Cellar Door\u2019s owners, Ethan Pikas, learned while cooking at a fine-dining restaurant in Phoenix called Binkley\u2019s. Except at Cellar Door, the ratios are pushed to the brink: less egg in relation to cream and milk in the custard, more butter laminated into the pa\u0302te brise\u0301e, yielding a crust with puff pastry\u2013like flakiness. The fat content in the dough is so high that you can\u2019t trim the edges before it\u2019s baked: Without the excess overhang serving as a counterweight, the dough would collapse in on itself. The custard is so delicate that the baked quiche has to chill overnight before it can even be sliced.I have a lot of thoughts about Cellar Door: about why it\u2019s my favorite restaurant in Chicago, about why it\u2019s significant that it\u2019s in Chicago, about how it rejects and rethinks so many deeply ingrained aspects of restaurant culture. But I think the quiche\u2014both in its greatness and in its limitations\u2014makes the clearest introduction to the very particular mentality of this restaurant.The quiche tells you what uncommonly, absurdly, perfectionist-ly good cooking is going on at Cellar Door Provisions. But it also tells you that there\u2019s more to Cellar Door than creating the best possible version of something. It tells you that it also matters whether the cooks enjoy working on something. It matters that the food makes you feel good and healthy\u2014not just as a diner but also as a cook. And the quiche matters so much that no compromises will ever be made to sacrifice its quality. \u201cThe more of something you make, the worse it gets,\u201d Bezsylko says. \u201cI can\u2019t see any pleasure in having a quiche factory.\u201dPart 2: The ChefNow, a confession. Cellar Door Provisions has been my favorite restaurant in my hometown of Chicago for years, but until recently I could not have told you who the chef was. This might not seem that weird\u2014plenty of people go out to eat without caring who the chef is\u2014except that as a food writer, it\u2019s been my job for the past decade to know this type of information. It\u2019s also weird because the hype surrounding a new restaurant opening pretty much always revolves around who the chef is. How is it possible that some of the most original cooking happening anywhere in this country is at a restaurant that has never touted its chef as any kind of public figure, and in fact, for a long time, didn\u2019t really have a head chef in the traditional sense at all?Confitted carrots\nPhoto by Alex LauIt goes back to 2013, when Pikas and Bezsylko signed a lease on a corner space in Logan Square, had a friend build two long wooden tables for the dining room, brought on two more cooks (Justin Behlke and Alex Truong), handwrote the menu on a roll of butcher-block paper, and, in February 2014, opened Cellar Door Provisions. There was no splashy press release. None of the articles written about the opening indicated who the chef was. Chicago\u2019s food scene is informed by who worked for whom: You come up under, say, Paul Kahan, or Mindy Segal, or Rick Bayless. The Cellar Door crew had none of this context.Bezsylko had moved to Chicago in 2010 from Berkeley, where he was working on his dissertation in philosophy and riding his bike to Tartine Bakery three times a week. Unable to find good bread in Chicago, he studied the Tartine Bread book and began baking his own, two loaves at a time, then somehow 30 loaves a week, which he sold to friends out of his house in Humboldt Park.Pikas grew up in the suburbs of Chicago, but the only experience he\u2019d had at a local restaurant was doing a stage (the restaurant equivalent of an internship) at Alinea. The two had begun collaborating on \u201cBread Nights\u201d at Bezsylko\u2019s house: pop-up dinners built around the sought-after loaves. \u201cAfter four dinners, we decided to open a neighborhood spot,\u201d Bezsylko says, \u201cwith no real plan. I envisioned it as... my house.\u201dThe place has never received a formal, starred review from a critic. And a \u201cchef \" is not something you would be able to easily identify in the open kitchen, which has often looked to me a bit like some kind of Oberlin College food co-op. In lieu of fancy, shiny equipment, there are jars of various shapes and sizes lining shelves set up wherever there\u2019s space. On more than one occasion, I\u2019ve seen more people shaping loaves of bread and laminating croissants than eating in the actual restaurant.Most people open restaurants so they can serve dishes they already know how to make. Cellar Door is not most restaurants.The roles \u201cwere not well defined,\u201d Pikas says, looking back on the opening. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want a traditional kitchen hierarchy.\u201d Instead, what Pikas and Bezsylko wanted was true collaboration: weekly meetings to determine the menu, equal standing among all. As for the name, \u201cWe couldn\u2019t think of a better one,\u201d Pikas says with what I now understand to be nearly pathological humility. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a mouthful.\u201dA perfectly swirly oolong-plum laminated brioche\nPhoto by Alex LauMost people open restaurants so they can serve dishes they already know how to make. Cellar Door is not most restaurants. \u201cIt was a one-and-a-half-year endeavor of my figuring out how to make croissants,\u201d Pikas says. Scones were a two-year project. Pikas doesn\u2019t dabble; he drills down, writing detailed recipes in painfully neat handwriting on small pieces of notebook paper, then tweaking and rewriting them until he reaches something that approximates perfection. (I doubt he would ever consider anything he\u2019s made perfect, or even finished for that matter.) In the first year, Bezsylko baked Cellar Door Provisions\u2019s naturally fermented loaves.Not to sound like some San Francisco bread bro, but you literally could not find this type and quality of bread in Chicago in 2014, and it is still, in my opinion, the city\u2019s best: for the crackly crust, for the unevenly holed crumb, for the tangy, sweet depths of its long-fermented flavor. I ask Pikas what makes Cellar Door\u2019s bread so good, but of course, he pauses at the premise. \u201cWe are still learning it, honestly,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are so many improvements we could make.\u201dEventually the roles became more defined. Pikas is now officially the executive chef. Bezsylko\u2019s title is sous-chef and assistant general manager. And in 2016, Emily Sher came on board, first washing dishes, then working front-of-house, and now as general manager and a partner. Still, you get the sense that Pikas and Bezsylko are constitutionally resistant to any inference of hierarchy. \u201cI\u2019m uncomfortable representing the restaurant as \u2018my\u2019 thing,\u201d Pikas says. \u201cI\u2019m in this process of learning as a cook. I\u2019ve never felt like \u2018I\u2019m a chef.\u2019\u201dPart 3: The CardoonsCellar Door Provisions opens on Wednesday at 8 a.m., and as usual, there is no one waiting to get in. A lot of things are going on in the kitchen that I can\u2019t really follow. Chuck Cruz, the lead line cook, is frying buckwheat groats and talking with Hailee Catalano, a line cook, about buying a goat. They also happen to be a couple; \u201cwe always work the same station,\u201d Catalano says. Someone offers me a spoonful of peach-leaf syrup (clean and vegetal), then a hunk of red kuri squash that\u2019s been lacto-fermenting for two days (practically carbonated), then a sip of something labeled \u201csunchoke milk\u201d (the most cereal-y of cereal milk).Moya, the chef de cuisine, is cleaning a vegetable I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019ve never seen in its raw incarnation before, which looks like oversized hardy greens that have been left to wilt in the fridge: cardoons. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone else buys this from this farmer,\u201d he says, admiring the grayish-green stalks. I hesitate to say this to Moya, but even after the considerable amount of time he spends elaborately cleaning and trimming the cardoons, they still look like sad celery.If Cellar Door were a band, its catalog would be divisible into two categories: Top 40 hits and the deep cuts, the not-crowd-pleasers.Over the two days I spent interviewing the Cellar Door crew, here are some words no one ever said: local, sustainable, organic, seasonal, farmers\u2019 market. This type of sourcing is so core to the Cellar Door project that it all simply goes without saying. Of course, the commitment to this ethic is visible everywhere\u2014even in the quiche: the eggs from Mint Creek Farm, the cream from Kilgus Farmstead, the little pile of greens alongside from Three Sisters Garden, all in central Illinois.Chocolate-persimmon tart\nPhoto by Alex LauUnlike other restaurants that hype their farmers or their larders, at Cellar Door you kind of have to pry to fully understand what is going on with the food. A brussels sprouts salad, for instance. You can guess that the sprouts are from a nearby farm. You can see that they\u2019re prepared two ways: the outer leaves blanched, the interior hearts roasted. But what are the powders on top? \u201cA little bit of sumac and dehydrated ramp-root powder,\u201d Pikas says. And what is the sauce underneath? That\u2019s a pure\u0301e of turnips and house-made tahini. Oh, and the leaves are dressed in sunchoke oil\u2014which is just the sunchoke scraps they\u2019ve been amassing, infused into sunflower oil at a really low temp\u2014 and seasoned with the liquid from a jar of pickled turnips. \u201cThat\u2019s one nice simple dish,\u201d Pikas says.At dinner, which Cellar Door began serving on Friday and Saturday nights in 2017, the menu changes weekly. There might be confitted celery root with blood oranges, and a Sardinian-style dumpling filled with ricotta, and cultured brined butter\u2014wait, I haven\u2019t even gotten to the butter. Cellar Door makes its own, using cultured Kilgus cream mixed with a cre\u0300me frai\u0302che culture they\u2019ve had going for five years now. But because they can\u2019t just serve their regular house-made cultured cre\u0300me frai\u0302che butter at dinner (where\u2019s the fun in that?), they whisk some brine into it\u2014 you know, like from the Napa cabbage they\u2019ve got lacto-fermenting\u2014to create an extra layer of, well, I don\u2019t know what it is, but it\u2019s definitely something.If Cellar Door were a band, its catalog would be divisible into two categories. The first would be the Top 40 hits that everyone loves and immediately understands: quiche, cup of coffee, the canele\u0301 with its deeply burnished shell and custardy insides. You taste it; you get it.The sunny scene at Cellar Door's lunch rush.\nPhoto by Alex LauBut there\u2019s a whole other category: the deep cuts, the experiments, the not-crowd-pleasers. And like any good artist, Cellar Door is driven by its indefatigable commitment to this genre of cooking. The intensity of this mission\u2014to create new dishes built around vegetables, day after day\u2014is what invigorates Cellar Door. But...well, you know the myth about Icarus. I\u2019ll be honest: The savory food at Cellar Door can occasionally  fly a little too close to the sun. Everyone there admits as much. \u201cThe food got kind of unhinged\u201d at times, Sher says. \u201cIt kept the community rather small.\u201dNot to mention, this can all be rather exhausting. \u201cSometimes we\u2019re like, Who\u2019s making us do this?\u201d Sher says. \u201cOh, us!\u201d It\u2019s not just the grind of it but also a philosophical objection: \u201cObsessing over technique is often a way of interjecting my ego into food,\u201d Pikas says. \u201cIf it\u2019s possible, I want to get away from ego in food. Simple food can be more emotive than highly technical food.\u201dIn an effort to make some of the recipes \u201cless involved,\u201d the team decided to serve a dip. Pikas describes the recipe to me, which begins with blanching cardoons, rugged and fibrous as they are, five to six times. Could they not have made a dip with...something else? \u201cWe get interested in vegetables that aren\u2019t selling,\u201d Pikas explains, not to mention that cardoons fit a very particular Cellar Door flavor profile, which leans bitter, strong, and very determined.Part 4: The CityIn September of 2018, a coffee shop called Four Letter Word opened across the street from Cellar Door Provisions. \u201cSomeone was like, \u2018Hey, aren\u2019t you upset that a coffee shop opened across the street?\u2019 \u201dBezsylko tells me. \u201c\u2018Isn\u2019t that going to take away from your coffee sales?\u2019 \u201dHe had to explain to them: \u201cI asked for that to happen. I want them to sell coffee.\u201dBezsylko had seen that the space was available and reached out to Ria Neri, the roaster behind Four Letter Word, whose coffee Cellar Door had been brewing since 2016.\u201cChicago\u2019s a place where you can do that,\u201d says Bezsylko.Four Letter Word owner Ria Neri (left), whose coffee Cellar Door has been brewing since 2016.\nPhoto by Alex LauThat\u2019s something I think about: how Chicago makes Cellar Door possible, and how Chicago makes Cellar Door sometimes nearly impossible. Around the time the restaurant opened, the food-media universe was hitting the era I remember fondly as Peak Sqirl, the nationwide infatuation with Jessica Koslow\u2019s delightful L.A. cafe\u0301. Meanwhile, in our office in New York, it was as though there were only one restaurant in all of Manhattan: Gerardo Gonzalez\u2019s El Rey, with its way-beyond-coffee-shop food. What might have happened had Cellar Door opened in, say, Silver Lake, or the Lower East Side? Would \u201cThe Quiche\u201d have taken on the cult status of Koslow\u2019s Technicolor toast or Gonzalez\u2019s almond-milk Kale Caesar? In a city more hyped up on vegetables, would there have been lines out the door to see what new dishes would land on the Cellar Door menu each week, what today\u2019s riff on turnips might be?Or could Cellar Door exist only in Chicago? Away from the excessive media hype of NYC and L.A.? Here\u2014unlike Sqirl or El Rey (RIP)\u2014a restaurant of this caliber has remained a true neighborhood spot, a place where a regular can come and sit for hours, even on weekends. A place that can try things out and evolve at its own pace, without the pressure of expectations. A place that hasn\u2019t spawned another place. A place that is not pushing merch. A place that has never been nominated or short-listed or even really mentioned in the same breath as a James Beard Award. \u201cEven now we\u2019re not always busy,\u201d Pikas says. \u201cThere\u2019s a two-hour slot on our weekday mornings when there\u2019s never anyone in here.\u201dIn a city more hyped up on vegetables, would there have been lines out the door to see what new dishes would land on the Cellar Door menu each week?Why is that? I called Jason Hammel, who pioneered the whole Logan Square farm-to-table all-day-cafe\u0301 thing, like, 20 years ago at Lula Cafe. He called me back\u2014after just having left Cellar Door, where he\u2019d grabbed a scone. \u201cThere\u2019s never a time I\u2019m in there that I don\u2019t see someone else who\u2019s a chef or cook or front-of-house person,\u201d he said of the small but devoted community that has sustained the restaurant over the past five years. Hammel mentioned multiple times how envious he was of Cellar Door: \u201cThey continue to do what they do without the notion of expanding, and I don\u2019t just mean in space\u2014I mean in offerings, in when they\u2019re open. Their growth is deeper; they\u2019re digging down.\u201dWhile Cellar Door itself hasn\u2019t expanded, Bezsylko has somehow managed to spread its vibes out onto this quiet residential stretch of Diversey Avenue, which feels farther away than it actually is from the new barcades and taprooms in the heart of Logan Square. When the space next door to Cellar Door opened up, Bezsylko connected the building\u2019s owner with Bradford Taylor, the owner of the cult wine bar Ordinaire in Oakland, who\u2019d recently moved to Chicago and become a regular at Cellar Door.Any bottle from Diversey Wine can be brought to Cellar Door for a $10 corkage fee.\nPhoto by Alex Lau\u201cCellar Door very much jibed with my ideals at Ordinaire,\u201d Taylor says. Plus: \u201cI just love when I walk into a business and I can see that they are making choices that are  financially ridiculous.\u201d In May 2018, Taylor opened Diversey Wine shop next door.The previous year, Cellar Door had completed a major renovation, replacing its original chairs and tables with minimal blond wood ones, launching BYOB dinner, and building a neat little interior passageway between its dining room and the wine shop. Now Cellar Door has a liquor license, and Taylor puts together the cafe\u0301\u2019s by-the-glass list of whatever-he\u2019s-into-at-that-moment natural wines, while customers can still pick out any bottle of wine from Diversey and open it at Cellar Door for a $10 fee.The result is a trio of like-minded businesses whose boundaries blur. The morning I was in the kitchen at Cellar Door, Moya was running a tray of pastries\u2014craggy scones, chubby hunks of apple coffee cake\u2014across the street to Four Letter Word. In the afternoon I met Sher there for an interview; it\u2019s basically her office. I asked Neri, the Four Letter Word owner, whether she ate often at Cellar Door, and she paused before offering a tepid \u201cyes.\u201d\u201cHow often?\u201cSometimes twice a day.\u201d Her roaster, Ari Sofiakis, has set the record for most visits to Cellar Door in a single day: five.Part 5: The DreamI dug through the mud of the internet to find what I think is the earliest mention of Cellar Door, from a short post on Eater in December 2013. The second line is a quote from Bezsylko: \u201cWe hope to question some of the standard assumptions of the restaurant industry. Assumptions to do with capital, working conditions, waste, and perhaps even the very purpose of restaurants in our culture.\u201dLine cook Hailee Catalano and lead line cook Chuck Cruz plating in the kitchen.\nPhoto by Alex LauWho says that to a reporter from Eater who\u2019s just trying to find out what day your restaurant is opening?I call up Bezsylko. \u201cI don\u2019t remember that at all,\u201d he says. \u201cHow do you challenge those assumptions?\u201d I ask. \u201cYou know what you should read?\u201d he asks in return. I\u2019m thinking he might point me to an Audre Lorde text; Sher had sent me one she liked. Instead, he starts summarizing a review from Cellar Door\u2019s Yelp page: \u201cFrom what I understand, the owners started this place purely out of a passion for food and experimenting with it,\u201d writes Avita T. \u201cIt was really not started to be a business, and so the restaurant does close relatively frequently, erratically.\u201dBezsylko objects to the reviewer\u2019s claim of erratic closures, but otherwise he loves her description. \u201cThere\u2019s something about the ethos of the place that challenges a lot of assumptions about the bottom line,\u201d he says. To start: He, Pikas, and Sher have not taken a profit. (Related: Cellar Door has never turned a profit.) Second: \u201cWe invest in our labor as heavily as we can,\u201d paying their employees more than they pay themselves, giving their staff two days off in a row, and closing for a week three times a year so no one has to worry about getting time off  with their families at Thanksgiving or Christmas. Third: They have practically no investors, so they can base their decisions on their principles\u2014not on what will yield a return.I ask Bezsylko if running a restaurant for five years has tempered any of his idealism. \u201cIf anything,\u201d he responds, \u201cI\u2019ve become more idealistic about what a restaurant can do.\u201d The values at Cellar Door have \u201cbeen aspirational\u2014 because the restaurant has been hanging on by a thread cash-wise,\u201d he says. Bezsylko now sees being a little more of a business as a way to realize those values\u2014of paying people more, of one day being able to provide health insurance for his staff. \u201cI\u2019ve become even less cynical,\u201d he says, then quickly corrects himself. \u201cI guess I\u2019ve never been a cynic.\u201dSher, Pikas, and Bezsylko are constantly self-reflecting. How do we make more money without pricing people out? How do we find funds for staffers for professional development? How do we get more people to come in for dinner?That last question seemed to be top of mind on my trip to Chicago in November, soon after which Cellar Door decided to change its prix fixe dinner menu to an a\u0300 la carte format.\u201cWe\u2019re still figuring it out,\u201d Sher said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we always do.\u201dExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishChicagoRestaurantsRead MoreLifestyleWhen Did Healthyish Pizza Become a Thing?By Priya KrishnaRecipes you want to make.
