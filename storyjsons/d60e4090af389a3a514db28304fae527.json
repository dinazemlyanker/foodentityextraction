He begins to map out the milestones of his life in proximity to where he lives now. He\u2019s three blocks from his first high school. Two and a half miles from the high school he graduated from. Three miles from his childhood home. \u201cEverything I know is L.A.,\u201d Gray continues. \u201cL.A. is me, and food is the best representation of me.\u201dEnter Brandoni Pepperoni, Gray\u2019s pizza pop-up that\u2019s a cheese-covered homage to his hometown, from the farmers market ingredients to the West Coast hip-hop-inspired names. He started making pizzas for fun, mainly at the request of friends, but ever since he opened orders to the public, the pop-up has taken a life of its own. Perhaps that\u2019s because of the branding (trying saying Brandoni Pepperoni without smiling), or maybe it\u2019s because of the giddy-making magic you feel when you place the order via text and pick it up at Gray\u2019s home. But it\u2019s definitely because of Gray\u2019s technique, honed after years working in restaurant kitchens like Providence and Trois Mec; proudly Californian provenance; and a little attitude (recognize the song titles on the menu?). Here he explains everything that goes into one of his best-selling pizzas: Colors.The DoughLike many iconic hip-hop tracks, this pizza dough is the product of collaboration. Gray hit up chefs and pandemic-era sourdough enthusiasts for pointers on how to perfect his dough. The current iteration is made up of two Italian flours\u2014very fine Tipo 00 and stone-ground Buratto\u2014and one local flour, Rouge de Bordeaux from heritage grain farm Tehachapi Grain Project, for extra wheat-y flavor. After the flours are mixed with water and yeast, the dough is slowly fermented for 24 hours. The result is a pizza crust with just the right amount of chew and crackle.The SauceBianco DiNapoli tomatoes are cooked down for hours with dried oregano and thyme from Kandarian Organic Farms in San Luis Obispo; \u201cthe best garlic in the world\u201d from Milliken Family Farms in Santa Barbara; and, in lieu of the usual red pepper flakes, Thai chile powder. \u201cIt adds a unique spiciness and a smoky vibe,\u201d Gray explains. \u201cThis is me going against the grain.\u201dThe VegColeman Family Farms in Carpinteria supplies about 70 percent of the produce for Brandoni Pepperoni, but Gray\u2019s got a soft spot for the farm\u2019s extra leafy broccolini. \u201cYou never see broccolini with leaves\u2014some farmers tear them off\u2014but Coleman keeps them on and I love them,\u201d he says. \u201cThey crisp up like chips in the oven and lend an earthy flavor.\u201dThe SausageThis is not your classic Italian sausage. \u201cThis is my interpretation of Jimmy Dean\u2019s breakfast sausage,\u201d Gray says. \u201cI grew up on that.\u201d Maple syrup gives this garlicky, fennel-y, porky mix that same nostalgic sweetness. It also balances out the sausage\u2019s triple dose of heat: Kashmiri chile powder, smoked paprika, and more Thai chile powder.The CheeseGray ventured beyond state lines for Grande, the \u201ccr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me\u201d of mozzarella made in Wisconsin.The Finishing Touches\u201cTen years ago, people were putting edible flowers on food to make it look pretty, but they served no other purpose,\u201d Gray explains. \u201cBut here they emphasize something.\u201d The yellow broccolini flowers echo the bitterness of the broccolini, while the fresh cucumber-like flavor of the purple borage plays off that sharpness. A drizzle of garlic oil, made by poaching Milliken Family Farm\u2019s finest in Buon Gusto Farms olive oil, finishes Colors, which is named after the famed Ice-T song. \u201cIt represents my personality,\u201d Gray says. \u201cEating this, you\u2019re like, \u2018Pow, bang, boom.\u2019\u201dExplore Bon App\u00e9titDish DecodedLos AngelesRead MorerestaurantsAt Charleston\u2019s Jackrabbit Filly, Here's How to Eat Your Weight in LuckBy Jenny LiaorestaurantsEverything That Goes Into a Hot, Luscious Bowl of Mohinga at Brooklyn\u2019s RangoonBy Hilary CadiganrestaurantsHow Do I Love Thee, Chinese Sponge Cake?
