It was 1994, and Strega Nona by Tomie dePaola was hot on the Reading Rainbow circuit. My second-grade teacher invited a guest to read the story, and I listened intently, intrigued by the \u201cgrandma witch\u201d with a magic pasta pot that accidentally flooded her town with spaghetti. I don\u2019t remember who our guest was\u2014experiential learning and frequent visitors were normal in our magnet curriculum\u2014but I remember how she passionately taught us to make spaghetti after the reading. We added butter and Parmesan cheese to our fresh noodles, and some risk-takers, like me, topped our bowls off with freshly cracked black peppercorns.I didn\u2019t have family meals like this, nor a magical cooking grandmother like Strega Nona. Growing up in Malden and Cambridge, Massachusetts, I was a latchkey kid often doing extracurricular activities or in the care of others. My mom, a single mother who emigrated from Haiti to the Boston metro area, worked multiple jobs and rarely cooked. So we dined out often, getting pork chops and blood sausage at Izzy\u2019s Restaurant or griot (fried pork), banan peze (fried plantain), and pikliz (pickled cabbage with Scotch bonnet peppers) at Highland Cuisine when my mom missed home.Eating the pesto alfredo with massive chicken cutlets and homemade fettuccine became my ritual.\nPhoto by Joe St. PierreBut I longed for that second-grade feeling of eating meals as a family. Eventually, I found it at La Famiglia Giorgio\u2019s in Boston\u2019s North End. I was a sophomore in high school, wandering around Little Italy in search of \u201creal Italian\u201d food before a school trip to Italy and for a place to read Weetzie Bat unbothered. I stumbled into La Famiglia Giorgio\u2019s and ordered the pesto alfredo with chicken, broccoli, and homemade fettuccine. Instantly I was hooked. The garlicky cream sauce was like nothing I\u2019d had before, and the chicken was massive, larger than the size of my hand. It was the first restaurant where servers were genuinely kind to me and treated me like a paying customer rather than an inconvenience. The staff let me be, and I sat there for hours, peeling back the pages of my book and trying to tackle the massive dairy-doused cutlets and pile of pasta. It soon became my ritual. Here is where I\u2019d happily spend my after-school job paychecks, where I\u2019d bring friends and secret girl crushes. The dining room of La Famiglia became my own.The warm dining room of La Famiglia Giorgio\u2019s was the first space I held for my tribe.\nPhoto by Joe St. PierreThis restaurant was the first place I started actively holding space for my tribe, where I started fantasizing about what family and home could look like for me as a queer black American child of immigrants. Now as an adult, I hold this kind of space as the cofounder of BLK PALATE, a production company and culinary collective that curates dining experiences, menus, and media that disrupt food culture and honor the African diaspora.What I eat, where I eat, and whose food I eat is a way to reignite memories and re-create the moments when I felt most emotionally full. For me, that\u2019s the Haitian food my mother longed for. But it\u2019s also the pesto alfredo at La Famiglia Giorgio\u2019s. The fresh al dente noodles coated in rich basil-laden sauce have become synonymous with a comfort I\u2019d rarely felt growing up: the comfort of a community, ready to feed both your belly and your spirit.Cleopatra Zuli is an educator, private cook, writer, and the cofounder of BLK Palate, a Brooklyn-based culinary collective and production company.Explore Bon App\u00e9titRestaurantsItalian AmericanRed SauceMassachusettsRead MorerestaurantsRed Sauce AmericaBy Bon App\u00e9titRecipes you want to make.
