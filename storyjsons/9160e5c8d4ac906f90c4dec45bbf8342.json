It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.Hit me with that garlic brothAw man, everyone is getting SICK. Stay home! One of the first stories I wrote for BA was about what opera singers do to prevent colds and sore throats, and I\u2019ve been making lemon-honey-ginger tea and warbling like a stray cat in my shower ever since. I brewed pot after pot this week, hoping to ward off the germs. To really double down on cold prevention\u2122, I also made a batch of Chris Morocco\u2019s garlic broth in my Instant Pot, which is sort of a silly thing to do because it takes just as long to make as it does on the stove when you factor in pressurizing time. But it seemed like a good idea at the time. I added a Fresno chile, ginger, and then whisked some egg in, stracciatella-style. Staffers Emily Schultz and Sasha Levine also made the same recipe this week. Emily doctored hers up by adding in a slurry of miso + water, ginger, scallions, spinach, and udon. Sasha drank hers with tons of flaky salt. Whether or not we\u2019ll be able to defeat the common cold has yet to be determined. Vampires on the other hand, we haven\u2019t seen them around these parts for days.Want this letter before it hits the website? Sign up for our newsletter!Zach Hilty/BFA.com\u201cDo you see the unicyclist?\u201dThat was Ryan Walker, assistant to editor in chief Adam Rapoport, giving directions to the Hot 10 Party this week, smack in the middle of Brooklyn. Inside, a crowd of 1,200 (I didn\u2019t count) ate bites from all of this year\u2019s winning restaurants, as well as some returning alumni like Chef\u2019s Table star Cristina Martinez of South Philly Barbacoa. Contributing writer Priya Krishna overheard a partygoer say: \u201cI went to Pilates before this\u2014it better be worth it.\u201d I hope it was, Pilates lady!! Molly Baz was confronted by strangers skipping any introduction, demanding to know: \u201cWhere\u2019s Brad?\u201d At home with his babies! Someone asked Alex Delany if he was Alex Delany. Yes, yes he is. \u201cWell I\u2019m Nick Delany,\u201d he continued, \u201cand my brother\u2019s name is also Alex Delany, and he HATES you!\u201d So we\u2019d like to take this moment to apologize to artist Alex Delany, who wants nothing to do with Bon App\u00e9tit, which is totally understandable. Sorry Mr. Delany!THE FOOD. I beelined for Maydan\u2019s melt-off-the-bone lamb shoulder on a creamy tahini sauce with a puffy soft triangle of pita. The very long line for Yume Ga Arukara\u2019s udon was worth every minute. Nyum Bai\u2019s prahok ktiss filled the room with the scent of fish sauce and pork, which made me happy as much as it amazed me\u2014how much flavor was packed into a bite that fit in the palm of my hand! I spotted Christina Chaey pop a perfect cylinder of Nonesuch\u2019s seared daikon into her mouth like it was a peanut M&M.Zach Hilty/BFA.comIn the courtyard where Elske\u2019s David and Anna Posey were scooping apple cider shaved ice while others huddled under heat lamps, I ran into Andrew Knowlton\u2014old deputy editor, new Netflix star\u2014wearing a Beto for Texas shirt. He said he only reads this newsletter instead of the magazine. So this is a test to see if he\u2019s really reading. TESTING, TESTING. (If you want to see Knowlton as a reality TV host where everything in the world, plus some food, seems to be at stake, watch the trailer for his new show, The Final Table, here. We\u2019re planning a drinking game for it already. Gotta support the team.)THAT\u2019S THE LAST PLUG I\u2019LL DO FOR YOU, KNOWLTON!The hangover\u201cI\u2019ve been trying to get a Bloody Mary all day.\u201d \u201cI want an enormous Bloody.\u201d \u201cI want aioli.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m making CACIO E PEPE for dinner.\u201d \u201cI want a boat of French fries.\u201d \u201cI want a big Italian sando.\u201d These are just a few of the notes I took when staffers with faded after-party stamps still on their hands trickled into the office, groaning. For those of us who skipped the after-party, preferring sleep and solitude, we apparently missed a drag queen who makes fantastic babinka based on her grandmother\u2019s recipe, obscene scoopfuls of caviar, and Pet-Nat in branded solo cups. Sounds about right.The bagel emojihas been updated. Apple designers added some jiggly-looking cream cheese to placate the angry hoards. Still oddly unappetizing, but maybe that\u2019s because the bagel\u2019s dimpled texture reminds me of parts of my body better left unmentioned.ARE YOU READYFor THANKSGIVING? Our November issue hit newsstands in NY/LA this week (nationwide next week). And it debuts a squeaky clean redesign by creative director Michele Outland, who talked to The Cut about how she gets it done, my favorite series to read when I\u2019m not getting much else done. Speaking of knowing when to not get it done, I\u2019ve been thinking about this part of Michele\u2019s routine all week: \u201cOne rule I definitely do is when I open my eyes in bed, I do not check my emails, because I\u2019m trying to be relaxed and enter the day peacefully.\u201dPhoto by Christina ChaeyOverheard in the office\u201cI\u2019m just not a yeast girl,\u201d Christina Chaey lamented, while we ate her slightly dense (due to old, possibly DEAD, yeast) rendition of Claire\u2019s apple coffee cake. It was still amazing. The thinly sliced apple topping is divine\u2014especially with lemon-ginger tea.Food meme of the weekUnnecessary food feud of the weekWhat appetizers does a cocktail party need? The test kitchen argued over what to serve to our Hot 10 chefs at a gathering in the office on Tuesday. Molly ended up making kimchi dip, artichoke dip (yes we already bothered her for the recipe), and nutritional yeasty popcorn. But for some reason Chris Morocco wanted larb. He even ordered the ground pork for it! \u201cWas I supposed to make it?\u201d Molly wondered when Chris SHOWED UP TO THE PARTY THREE HOURS LATE. \u201cChris has this ability to put a spell on us,\u201d Andy Baraghani explained, \u201cAs a witch, I\u2019m impressed.\u201d So to mess with him, the food team Slack group chat pretended to be inundated with work while Chris was out shooting a Christmas cookie story, begging him to return to help them cook for the crowd.CHRIS RESPONDS: \u201cI was punked so bad! Instead of seeing some of the best chefs in the country commenting on our brave and visionary inclusion of larb with the other appetizers, I saw bricks of raw meat stacked in the walk-in and bottles of natural wine being drunk like hipster Gatorade, while I was carting Alex Lau\u2019s computer across town.\u201d Excuses, excuses!Explore Bon App\u00e9titBeggs NewsletterRecipes you want to make.
