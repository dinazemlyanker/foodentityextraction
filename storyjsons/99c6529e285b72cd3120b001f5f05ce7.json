Check. Rolling hillsides? Check. Rounded archways with marble columns? Check and check. This is Italy as viewed through rose-colored glasses, and it\u2019s likely painted right on the wall at your favorite red sauce joint\u2014including right here at Il Cortile in New York. Like the menu, authenticity isn\u2019t the number-one concern with these murals\u2014which somehow, no matter where they are in the country, all seem to recite the same visual language. They\u2019re not meant to be museum-quality, but regardless, we asked a few particularly savvy art world insiders to explain the phenomenon\u2014and weigh in on this very particular aesthetic.Ben Davis, national art critic, Artnet News\u201cI think the kinds of murals in Italian restaurants represent \u2018Italianness\u2019 distilled to this really easily digestible, magical, nostalgia thing\u2014which is how this landscape has been used since the 17th century at least. This art fits very well with the American version of Italian food. I mean, Italians find spaghetti and meatballs totally alien, so it\u2019s fitting that it be eaten beneath murals that are very much American remixes of an idea of the Italian landscape.\u201dJerry Saltz, senior art critic, New York Magazine\u201cWhatever type of restaurant I may go to\u2014Italian, Korean, Japanese, Chinese, Ethiopian, French, Spanish, Indian\u2014they all have some sort of pictures and paintings of the place being conjured. Taste involves memory, and memory involves the imagination\u2014the \u2018magic words,\u2019 incantation of place, period, style, etc. And maybe it\u2019s easier\u2014and more politically correct\u2014to render a landscape than the types of people from a given place?\u201dAt New York\u2019s Il Cortile, the ideal countryside villa comes with a very extra garden.\nPhoto by Chelsie CraigXavier F. Salomon, chief curator, The Frick Collection, New York City\u201cBoth the actual landscape and the painted one are fundamental in Italian history and culture. The combination of Tuscany/wall paintings seems to be fixed in people\u2019s minds, so any Italian restaurant is designed to look like a Medici palace or villa. I find these artworks, generally speaking, rather harmless. I always think of the Italian art historian Federico Zeri, who used to say \u2018the worse the art in restaurants, the better the food.\u2019 So I love restaurants with bad art!\u201dJulia Wolkoff, art history editor, Artsy\u201cThe painters of lavish frescoes in Roman and Pompeiian villas delighted in constructing landscapes\u2014fantastical gardens or futuristic cities\u2014as pleasurable means of trompe l'oeil escapism. But as a patron at a red sauce restaurant, have you ever truly felt transported by these faux frescoes? That seems to be their purpose, yet I always remain keenly aware of chips in the dinnerware, dirt in the cracks of the floor tiles, or other gritty markers of dining in New York City. That said, would I feel comfortable eating at a red sauce restaurant that didn't have such decoration? Probably not!\u201dSarah Cascone is a senior writer at Artnet News.Explore Bon App\u00e9titRed SauceItalian AmericanRestaurantsNew YorkRead MorerestaurantsRed Sauce AmericaBy Bon App\u00e9titRecipes you want to make.
