Associate food editor Kendra Vaculin has a citrusy solution to your legume doom with a lemony dressing combining zest-infused oil and bright juice that pulls double duty as a marinade for canned beans and as a dressing for the salad itself. Marinate any white bean (like cannellini, navy, or Great Northern), then toss them with pleasantly bitter radicchio, thinly sliced raw brussels sprouts, and big chunks of salty feta.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

I used Napa cabbage instead of radicchio because it\u2019s what I had, but I followed everything else on the recipe. It tasted great. Will definitely make this again. JaneDurham, NC3/9/2022This is our new favorite salad. Tons of flavor and the feta adds just enough to make the salad a substantive lunch. Bright flavors for spiffing up a winter day. We make a batch and take it for lunch for several days.TraceyAiken, SC2/6/2022Wow, this was a hit! Made this with a few adjustments (tips from reviewers\u2014thank you!): soaked radicchio in ice water while prepping other ingredients, let the oil infuse off-heat in pan for 20 mins (after initial heating), made my own beans the day before (Rancho Gordo Garbanzos), squeezed fresh lemon on top to serve. Absolutely smashing. Would be great with some sliced pepperoncinis as well. If you like salty-sour-bitter flavor profiles, this one's for you.DreSan Francisco1/21/2022I found this incredibly delicious as is! The beans and pistachio are mild and creamy enough to balance the flavour of the radicchio, and it doesn't need an additional Dijon vinaigrette. Make sure to give the oil enough time to infuse (mine was on the heat for probably twenty minutes). I did use the tip of putting the radicchio in ice water while prepping the other ingredients and it definitely removed some of the bitterness while making the radicchio come alive.AnonymousBrooklyn, NY1/6/2022Following the suggestions in the comments we soaked the radicchio and added Dijon, red wine vinegar, and maple syrup to the dressing. Those alterations to the original recipe made this a definite winner for us, and we will definitely be making it that way again.AngNY12/4/2021I stumbled across this recipe looking for a filling salad that I could prep ahead of time and eat for lunch over a couple days. I read through the comments and incorporated several of the brilliant suggestions offered, resulting in a very tasty end result.  I HIGHLY recommend soaking your radicchio in ice water to minimize bitterness as others suggested. Radicchio has a lot to offer, and this technique helps it shine and ensures your salad is visually beautiful.\n\nI found the infused oil to be a bit lacking as a dressing, so I stirred in 1 tbsp dijon, 2 tbsp red wine vinegar and 2 tbsp maple syrup to balance the flavors. This helped cut some bitterness and added a lot more depth. I also subbed pine nuts for pistachios because that's what I had on hand. They worked well, so I think most nuts/seeds could be a good fit here so long as they are crunchy and a little toasty. Lastly, the type of feta you use will really impact the overall feta, so I recommend avoiding a crumbled variety (like athenos) and getting a block that you hand crumble. These tend to have more flavor and better texture overall. In the future I might play around with adding a fruit element to this recipe (dried cherry/apricot) or serving over cooked farro if I want this to work as a dinner main. Thanks for the great  salad springboard BA!\n\nAbbySeattle, WA11/24/2021Made this exactly as directed but cut back a bit on the feta. We loved it, so simple but so delicious! Can\u2019t wait for lunch leftovers tomorrow. Will make it again soon!DoriDC11/18/2021I used thinly-sliced cabbage instead of radicchio and also topped it with crispy fried onions.  Delicious!  My new favorite salad.Paula VMichigan11/10/2021For everyone having issues with the bitterness of the radicchio, try soaking the chopped radicchio in an ice bath for ~30 mins while you prep all the other ingredients. Makes a huge difference!BreanneBrooklyn, NY11/9/2021This salad was delicious. I cooked Rancho Gordo Royal Corona beans for this recipe and had a beautiful head of radicchio from the farmers market. This time of year, Trader Joe\u2019s sells Brussels on the stalk and they are wonderful. We microplaned the lemon zest in lieu of making strips. Beautiful and delicious!Dizastro 11/7/2021Not good as written, way too plain and bitter. My oil nearly burnt on low heat after just a few minutes, and it didn\u2019t change the flavor of the beans at all. I made another vinaigrette with some sugar, honey vinegar, lemon and salt to cut through the bitterness. And I added another half-block of ricotta salata I had in the fridge. It was still just okay, salvageable but not serveable.chrispbaconBrooklyn, NY11/5/2021Love this salad! I used arugula instead of radicchio but kept everything else the same. It wasn\u2019t too bitter, but I think an extra lemon squeeze at the end would even take it up a notch further. PegBTustin, CA11/4/2021After reading the comments around the bitterness of this dish, I made some changes to the recipe. With these changes, my family loved this salad! To be transparent, it was still bitter but enjoyable. I wouldn\u2019t make this salad if you don\u2019t like bitter tasting things. The feta and marinated beans help to balance out the bitterness, but it is still bitter forward!\n\n- added 2x the lemon juice and a few tablespoons of white wine vinegar to cut though the bitterness\n- marinated the beans for an hour\n- roasted the Brussels sprouts and halved them to serve on top\n- used a very small radicchio (size of a softball) AnonymousArcata, CA11/3/2021I was so excited to try this recipe but unfortunately this was a miss, it was just WAY to bitter (and I used half of the amount radicchio from the recipe). I feel like it needs some sort of sweet element to balance it out, maybe like mandarin orange slices ? But, that's just a thought, I really have no idea. It was so unpleasant that we had to scrap the meal and order take out :(MissKikiChicago, IL 11/3/2021Felt very ehh about this salad. The radicchio combined with the raw brussels sprouts was too fibrous. I tried roasting both the radicchio and the brussels sprouts for 15 mins at 425, which softened them up quite a bit and made the salad more enjoyable.
