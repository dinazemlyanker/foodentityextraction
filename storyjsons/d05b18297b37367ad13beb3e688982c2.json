Made a speedy version to avoid heating the oven: boiled the sweet potatoes instead of roasting. Used avocado oil instead of sesame because I didn\u2019t have any, that will have messed with the flavor. It was still delicious. I would imagine it would be even better if I\u2019d roasted the potatoes first. Wow! I\u2019d love to know the origins of this flavor combination. Thank you Chris for a delicious meal. Sarah BTucson, AZ8/22/2021It only allows me to leave five stars\u2026I agree with \u201cThis was food.\u201dAnonymousCA6/24/2021This was good! I wasn't sure how it was going to turn out, but was impressed. Super filling and healthy. I roasted the potatoes for 40 minutes, and they were the perfect firmness. I sliced for just an easier and less messy process. I think the only thing I would change would be the amount of sesame oil in the glaze \u2014 it was strong and took over, but that just might be my own personal taste. Will definitely make again! LizzieMonterey, CA6/4/2021really delicious! will be adding this to the regular rotation. i only roasted the potatoes for 30 min and they tore perfectly but didnt turn to mush.teresa los angeles, ca3/16/2021Fantastic combination of flavors. Served this as a side to a Sunday Brunch with Crustless Spinach Quiche.   Layers and layers of flavors, each distinct.  Filling - will enjoy leftovers.     Recommend not precooking sweet potatoes, but definitely prepping lentils in advance.  Lentils had sufficient time to absorb the sauce but sweet potatoes were mushy.  I would also ever so slightly undercook the sweet potatoes when you first roast them, although my guests loved them this texture, they quickly lost shape and became mush in the skillet something a bit firm potato wouldn\u2019t do.  Followed the remainder of the recipe exactly as indicated.  Absolutely wonderful.  SheilaBerlin, NJ2/21/2021Delicious! Made this for the first time last night and we absolutely LOVED it! My store only had dried red lentils and Melissa's Steamed Lentils (which are brown) so I went with the Melissa's ones. I can't imagine this would taste any better using black or French green, tho. Thanks for a great new way to enjoy sweet potatoes - and lentils!annbbConnecticut2/18/2021Loved most of the flavors, but will omit the scallions next time-much too strong.  My sweet potatoes were basically a mush, so will have to figure out what went wrong with those when I make this again (and I will, I defiitely will).  Surprising how much flavor the lentils take on with just that minimal seasoning.  Really good!AnonymousArlington Heights, IL1/25/2021First time I made this I made only the potatoes. Flavours were great but my very tender-roasted potatoes didn't really crisp up/brown so the glaze wasn't really a glaze, it kind of soaked into the potatoes. Still delicious though. Second time I made the whole dish, this time my potatoes did brown - I think I put in too little oil the first time, apparantly it's also important to follow oil-measurements in recipes, ha - and the glaze was soooo perfect and sticky and delicious. I see people saying they doubled the glaze, which seems a bit much to me. The lentils I could do without, I think they need a little more and they're not worth the fuss with the ice bath. CarlyAmsterdam1/14/2021Hmm.  The flavors were very good but my sweet potatoes were basically a sweet potato hash.  I would forget the  scallions.  I served all of this hot which just seemed more appealing to me than cold lentils.  I was really looking forward to the glaze and it just didn't happen.  But ... I will try again - and if it turns out better, I will report in.KatharineStockholm, Sweden12/3/2020Great recipe!!! \nMade just the sweet potato part tonight for Thanksgiving. So good. Doubled the sauce, cause, why not? Jennifer K11/27/2020Wow we love this recipe ! it has become a weekly staple. I prefer to slice the sweet potatoes in about 1\" discs. I tried the tearing technique and prefer just slicing. Delicious ! Nicoleportland, or11/20/2020The first time I made this, the glaze cooked off pretty quickly. The other night I doubled the amounts for the glaze, and had plenty, which really allowed the flavor to come through more than my first time. I think next time maybe I'll try 1 1/2? But I really love this recipe.Emily F.Oakland, CA11/19/2020Amazing! I've made this on repeat the last few weeks. The flavors are delicious, and it seems very healthy. \nTakes some time but it's super easy. I followed the recipe exactly and don't think it needs any tweaking.Lindsey KCambridge, MA11/17/2020Fantastic recipe! Seemed relatively healthy and very delicious. AAnjellySanta Cruz, CA11/13/2020Holy moly this is delicious.  If you need to feed four people, you'll need to double the recipe.
