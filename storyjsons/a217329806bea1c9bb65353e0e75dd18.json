In this recipe from her new grain-and-bean-focused cookbook, Grist, chef Abra Berens recommends cooking them just until tender then frying them. Their creamy-crispy texture pairs beautifully with juicy bratwurst and a citrusy mojo sauce that\u2019s also great on blanched vegetables, roasted potatoes, and fish. Use black or French green lentils here, as they hold their shape when cooked and will crisp up better than their larger counterparts.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

So good!  The rosemary mojo is on point.  Use some high quality sausages for sure.  The whole combination of crispy lentils, crunchy cauli and a bit of pork is spot on. We'll be adding this to our weeknight rotation for a quick, tasty and relatively healthy go to. Anonymous1/6/2022If you overcook the lentils (like I did), the good news is that lentil/mojo mix makes a GREAT veggie dip.  AnonymousBaltimore MD11/14/2021Made this with beyond brats. This came together quickly with a nice payoff & plenty of flavor. I wasn't sure about the sausage/lentil/raw cauliflower combo & worried this dish would feel like it needed something.  I also thought it seemed like a lot of steps  . But I was wrong on both accounts. Made in my cast iron pan, which worked great. Will make again. AnonymousSeattle, WA10/6/2021Didn't really know what to expect as I'm not a raw cauliflower person, but this was shockingly good. That rosemary mojo could go well with many things, I'm already thinking of how to re-purpose it with other veggies. Made the recipe exactly as shown, the crispy lentils are very flavourful and the combination of the pork with the freshness of the cauliflowers just makes sense. Going in my recipe book for sure.Anonymous9/20/2021Explore Bon App\u00e9titMainDinnerNut-FreeDairy-FreeGluten-FreeHealthyishEasyQuickWeeknight MealsFryLentilVegetableFrench LentilBlack LentilSausageMeatCauliflowerRecipes you want to make.
