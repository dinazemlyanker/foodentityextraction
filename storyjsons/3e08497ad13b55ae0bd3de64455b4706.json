The chicken and hearty vegetables that comprise afritada are often stewed together, but here Miranda cooks each element of the dish separately and then combines them in a skillet. The reward for all your effort is a sublime mixture of textures in every bite: crispy-skinned chicken, tender-but-not-mushy vegetables, and velvety stewed tomatoes. \u201cThis is a dish I grew up eating and is one of my go-to comfort foods,\u201d she says. \u201cAlthough it\u2019s not as recognizable as chicken adobo, it\u2019s definitely close to the hearts of my team and myself.\u201dWatch Melissa make this recipe on our YouTube channel.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

The olives are a great touch and the end. We didn't change anything and it turned out really really well. R SalasDenver, CO 3/16/2022Amazing. Dabbed some sour cream into some spoonfuls and it was a really nice complement.AnonymousPhiladelphia2/9/2022My wife and I made this last night for Sunday evening dinner. It was absolutely fantastic. The flavors kind of reminded me of a cross between paella and ratatouille. The flavors come together very nicely and it's not too difficult of a recipe.Phil ShryockSeattle, WA1/31/2022Tried this recipe last night and the wife and I both loved it.  I made one major omission and left out the rice - just let the potatoes provide sufficient starch for the meal.  Next time, I plan to leave out the potatoes and served it over rice.  We highly recommend this one.AnonymousFair Oaks, CA1/27/2022keep wokeness out of food.filipina eldernew haven, ct1/24/2022Loved the great flavor!  I used boneless skinless chicken breasts because that's what I had on hand.  It was delicious, but I think thighs would have even more flavor.  So I'll try that next time.   It takes a bit of time prepping veggies and roasting, not at all difficult but better for a weekend when I have more time to cook.  OllieArlington VA1/23/2022Depth of each layer is delicious! Easy, fun, and Quick! Can\u2019t miss with this recipe\u2026excellent tasty dish.SkyePhoenix 1/23/2022One of the best recipes I have ever made. I had to make it again for my brother's family.
