(Ask your butcher to cut them if you can\u2019t find them because flanken-cut ribs have to be cut across the bone using a butcher\u2019s saw.) You\u2019ll want a big helping of rice to go along with it. This recipe is from chef Parnass Savang of Atlanta\u2019s Talat Market.Ingredients4 - 6 ServingsMarinade4garlic cloves1Tbsp. finely chopped cilantro root or stem3Tbsp. oyster sauce2Tbsp. fish sauce2tsp. freshly ground white pepper2\u00bdlb. \u00bc\"\u2013\u00bd\"-thick crosscut bone-in beef short ribs (flanken-style)Kosher saltStir-Fry and Assembly\u00bccup oyster sauce1Tbsp. fish sauce1tsp. freshly ground white pepper3Tbsp. vegetable oil1sweet onion, thinly sliced4garlic cloves, smashed2red Thai chiles, thinly sliced4scallions, sliced into 1\" pieces1cup Thai basil leavesCooked jasmine rice (for serving)Special Equipment:A mortar and pestlePreparationMarinadeStep 1Smash garlic and cilantro root with a mortar and pestle to a smooth paste.

I also made it with chicken and thin rice noodles and it was to die for.  AlexSt. Louis 1/11/2022Delicious! At first I didn\u2019t have any cilantro so I added Thai basil to the marinade, then I did get cilantro and added that also, yum! Seared the ribs in a cast iron pan then finished them in the oven at 375 because my ribs were cut really thick, perfection. Great flavor and awesome on rice or left over garlic mashed potatoes!AliaWenatchee WA1/1/2022This recipe was easy and super flavorful with the fish sauce/oyster sauce marinade. I marinaded the meat overnight and it was perfect for lunch the next day. Adding this to my recipe repertoire. My husband loved it.
