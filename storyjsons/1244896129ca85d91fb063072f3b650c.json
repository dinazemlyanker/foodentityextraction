Nora Gray co-owners Emma Cardarelli, who helms the kitchen, and Ryan Gray, who heads the wine program, transformed this long-vacant building into Elena, a natural wine and pizza heaven.ORDER THE: homemade pastas, veg-forward plates, and pizza (duh), which comes out of the wood-fired oven charred and bubbling with a crust that\u2019s somehow soft and crisp at the same time. Cardarelli and Gray place an emphasis on using products from local farms and natural techniques, meaning the pizza dough is naturally leavened (which gives it that subtle tang) and made from Quebec wheat. Gray\u2019s wine list highlights mostly natural wines from small Italian producers and, though there are only a couple of wines offered by the glass, the staff will pour you a taste from whatever magnums are open.THE VIBE IS: sophisticated and modern, with playful pops of color from the lavender and burnt sienna banquettes. It\u2019s the kind of chic affordable spot you desperately wish was in your neighborhood.PRACTICAL STUFF: Open every day 5 p.m. to 11 p.m. The restaurant fills up quickly, so reservations are recommended Thursday through Saturday via Resy.\u2014Claire SaffitzPhoto by Dominique LafondPhoto by Dominique LafondWE ALSO LOVENora GrayThe standout Italian restaurant in GriffintownDrogheria FineRun, don\u2019t walk to this Mile End window shop doling out perfectly tender gnocchiLo\u00efcAll roads (and great p\u00e9t-nat) lead to this Saint-Henri wine barExplore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
