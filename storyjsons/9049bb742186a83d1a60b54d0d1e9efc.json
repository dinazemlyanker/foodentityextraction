But people (56,000 of them) can\u2019t seem to get enough of his handmade pastas, now served at Andiario in West Chester, Pennsylvania.By Elyse InamineJuly 18, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailCeciliaGrace PortraitsFacebookTwitterEmailThis isn\u2019t the story of a long passed-down recipe from an Italian nonna. Anthony Andiario earned his pasta education after all his daytime classes at the Arizona Culinary Institute and shifts chopping garlic and parsley for $5 an hour at an Italian restaurant, both in Scottsdale, Arizona. \u201cIt\u2019s not a glamorous story,\u201d he tells me over the phone, with a laugh.But now Andiario, 39, is the pasta guy with 56,000 followers on Instagram\u2014and counting. They\u2019re watching his every flour-dusted move (see below), from nimbly folding tortelli to rolling out corkscrew-shaped conchiglie miste with a steak knife, and flooding his feed with comments like, \u201cI can\u2019t stop watching,\u201d \u201cThis guy makes pasta like no other,\u201d \u201cDit is zo satisfying.\u201d He makes pastas we\u2019ve never seen before (who\u2019s heard of conchiglie miste?) and transforms flour and eggs into something much greater than the sum of its parts. After 14 years of perfecting his craft at Quiessence and Tratto, under pizza legend Chris Bianco, he opened his own restaurant, Andiario in West Chester, Pennsylvania, this past spring.Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Back in 2004, Andiario\u2019s independent pasta study went like this: After his restaurant shift was over, around 10 p.m., he\u2019d cook in his small one-bedroom apartment, crammed with cookbooks and gnocchi paddles (but no Internet or cable). He\u2019d play some reggae, start boiling a pot of water, and delicately fold the flour and eggs together to make tagliatelle. Sliding the pasta into the boiling water, he\u2019d wait a minute or two and pluck them out and eat the noodles straight. Still hot, moist, and slightly pudgy with excess water. No sauce. (He couldn\u2019t afford to make it.) \u201cIs the noodle too thick or thin? Is the texture too sticky or dry? Is this depressing?\u201d he\u2019d ask himself. No. This was the dream.These days, Andiario\u2019s routine has hardly changed\u2014though the ingredients have gotten better. Every morning, he\u2019s the first to arrive at Andiario, once an old neighborhood drugstore (complete with a soda fountain) in the small borough of West Chester. He turns on reggae, gets a pot of water boiling, and gathers flour from Castle Valley Mill, durum from Green Meadow Farm, and whatever eggs his farmers bring him. He wrestles with tough spaghetti alla chitarra dough\u2014\u201cIt fights you back,\u201d he says\u2014and stamps out thin, coin-shaped corzetti rounds from a tool he picked up during his last trip to Italy a few years ago. Then, he drops them into boiling water, waits a bit, then fishes them out and downs them. Still hot, moist, and slightly pudgy. No sauce. (It\u2019s a preference now.) \u201cIs the noodle too thick or thin? Is the texture too sticky or dry?\u201d he continues to question himself. \u201cI\u2019m always chasing after perfection, trying to hone in and trying to do it better the next time,\u201d Andiario says. \u201cI know it will never be perfect, but\u201d\u2014he trails off a bit\u2014\u201cstanding here and making it, it\u2019s just so satisfying.\u201dTo get a sense of the method behind the flour-flecked madness, Andiario takes me through the pastas he\u2019s conjuring (and constantly perfecting) at Andiario.Spaghetti alla chitarra in progress\nCeciliaGrace PortraitsSpaghetti alla Chitarra\u201cYou need to be a pasta lover to eat this because it will bite you back. It\u2019s from the Abruzzo region and it\u2019s thick and chewy, not like a delicate ravioli. Here, I serve it simply: alla gricia with local guanciale and local sheep\u2019s milk cheese. It\u2019s a challenging noodle to make. I mix together semolina, egg, and flour, then I knead it for 10 to 15 minutes in 10-pound batches, let it rest, and push it through a chitarra, a tool to cut the pasta with guitar-like strings. I\u2019ve already broken a few of them.\u201dAndiario\u2019s beloved corzetti stamp along with freshly imprinted pasta\nAnthony AndiarioCorzetti (Little Disc)\u201cI found this hand-carved corzetti stamp at a kitchen shop near the Duomo in Florence. It wasn\u2019t initially out for display, but once the shopkeeper knew I was serious and willing to spend money, he brought it out to show me. It was only 60 euros, but it was such a special thing and he wanted to protect it. Typically in Liguria, corzetti is served with pesto or a mushroom sauce, and I love how the sauce falls into the folds of the design. So I just make a soft wheat dough with mushroom powder, water, and egg, roll it out thin, then punch out circles and stamp them with corzetti. All it needs is a few morels and a hickory cream sauce.\u201dNicchi get new life at Andiario\nAnthony AndiarioNicchi (Three-Cornered Priest\u2019s Hat)\u201cI discovered this pasta in a book about 15 years ago. It was one of the first ones I made at Quiessence, and the chef gave me a lot of grief for putting it on the menu because he didn\u2019t know what it was and was worried it wouldn\u2019t sell. He wanted pappardelle! I wanted to open with it at Andiario to harken back to that time. So I make a super eggy ravioli dough, roll it and cut it into squares, stuff with roasted Blue Hubbard squash and some shallot, and shape it into a three-pointed hat. It\u2019s very humble and I don\u2019t want to cover it up, so I toss it in a brown-butter sauce.\u201dGreen tortelloni as far as the eye can see\nAnthony AndiarioStinging Nettle Tortelloni\u201cOn my off days, I hike and I\u2019m always finding stinging nettles. I love them; they have this musky spinach flavor. So for this pasta, I blanch the nettles, shock in cold water, then puree. I\u2019ll hang that puree in a cloth in the walk-in to get rid of the excess water (if it\u2019s too watery, it messes with the dough), then mix with 00 flour and eggs. I\u2019ll fill the tortelloni with local ricotta and pecorino and fresh nettles, crisped up in brown butter.\u201dNests of tagliatelle\nAnthony AndiarioTagliatelle\u201cSimilar to spaghetti alla chitarra but silkier and softer, this versatile noodle is great with anything, bolognese ragu or porcinis and a little butter. Lately I\u2019m making a lot of tagliatelle with hard wheat and eggs. I roll it thinner than spaghetti alla chitarra but thicker than ravioli. It\u2019s a relatively effortless pasta to produce and everyone loves it. Right now I\u2019m tossing them with rendered guanciale, chile flakes, local asparagus, and a little cheese. That\u2019s it.\u201dTwo plump raviolos at Andiario\nAnthony AndiarioRaviolo\u201cA customer brought us a few dozen eggs from her chickens, and I wanted to thank her for them, so I made this very luxurious pasta. I remember the first time I had raviolo al uovo in Rome, sharing it with my girlfriend (and restaurant partner) Maria van Schaijik. You cut into it, and you get this gorgeous red egg spilling out with ricotta; I don\u2019t think it was dressed at all. We fought over it. It was that amazing. So, here we make the eggy raviolo dough, roll it out very thin, nestle the yolk in the ricotta, and serve with my own kind of truffle: dried mushrooms reconstituted, pureed, and dried into a ball. I grate over the raviolo to gild the lily.\u201dA flock of bird-shaped combas\nAnthony AndiarioCaombas (Doves)\u201cThis Sardinian pasta is a pretty special one. It\u2019s usually in a light chicken broth with lots of herbs and a raw egg yolk you stir into the broth. I found it while I was researching ravioli shapes one night, after scrolling through Google Images. So I tried recreating it at home, spending a few hours here and there tweaking the dough until I made a dough similar to tagliatelle, to keep its shape. I cut it into a triangle, trim the ends, and pinch the top so it looks like a dove. I serve it in a chicken broth with picked-over meat, wilted escarole, and of course, a raw egg yolk.\u201dBuild your own pasta fan base with these versatile doughs.Explore Bon App\u00e9titPastaChefsRestaurants + TravelPennsylvaniaRead MorecookingExpensive Pasta Is Worth It\u2014Here's WhyBy Alex DelanycookingMake Malfatti: Fluffy Ricotta Dumplings That Are So Much Easier Than GnocchiBy Alex BeggscultureHow to Drink and Snack Like an Italian on VacationBy Amiel StanekRecipes you want to make.
