Why not?By Elyse InamineOctober 21, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailThe nabeyaki udon at Raku\u00a0Photo by Laura MurrayFacebookTwitterEmailIs there anything more wonderful than thick Sanuki udon, noodles so delightfully chubby and squishy, like a baby\u2019s leg? Or milk tea with spring-loaded tapioca pearls that squeak between your teeth as you chew and chew and chew? Or sinewy, rip-curled slices of Chinese charcuterie-style beef tendon that tastes beefier and more delicious with each exerted bite?In my opinion, food with an intentional, unapologetic chew is the best kind of food. And I\u2019m not talking about chewiness in the way you might be familiar with in western cooking: steak that\u2019s too rare (or too well-done), boiled-to-death octopus, Knox\u2019s intensified gelatin. I\u2019m talking about the particular, highly desirable range of chewiness in East and Southeast Asian food, known as Q in Taiwan, jjolgit jjolgit in Korea, dai in Vietnam, and other not so easily translatable terms. But the best way to understand it is to start with the food itself.Beginning with the lowest value on the chewy scale, you\u2019ve got your noodles (wheat-based udon, rice noodles of all shapes), sticky rice, jellies (coconut, grass, like in Burmese falooda), and dumpling skins. These have a slippery texture and barely resist as you chew. Then there\u2019s Japanese mochi and Filipino kakanin, a coconutty glutinous rice cake, with a more pliable feel that verges on tacky. Next, there\u2019s the springy, al dente chew, like tteokbokki, Korean rice cakes; pinjaram, dense Malaysian coconut milk pancakes; and banh ja\u2019neuk, Cambodian tapioca dumplings filled with mung beans and cooked in a coconut-ginger syrup. On to more serious chew, we have the bouncy, elastic pearls in Taiwanese milk tea, which require more devoted masticating\u2014as in not just chewing to swallow but chewing...to chew. Then there\u2019s the chewiness that\u2019s like chomping on a fresh pack of tennis balls: plump Japanese chicken heart yakitori, Vietnamese beef balls bursting with aromatics, jiggly fried Filipino-style tripe. Finally, there\u2019s the most extreme category of them all, where all kinds of seafood jerky and those wisps of beef tendon fall. I call it tug-of-war chew: the texture that fights back when you bite, pushing you away as you gnaw, as if it were still alive.Across East and Southeast Asia, chewy isn\u2019t just a common texture but a powerful tool deployed to make food taste better. Here in the States, first- and second-gen chefs are relying on the texture to recreate the food they grew up with. \u201cChewy food, if it\u2019s cooked right, has a lot of flavor every time you take a bite,\u201d chef Tatsu Aikawa told me. \u201cIt\u2019s another element of taste.\u201d At Kemuri Tatsu-ya in Austin, he makes eihire, a Japanese-style stingray jerky. \u201cYou savor it more,\u201d says Christina Nguyen, chef and co-owner of Hai Hai in Minneapolis, where she makes Vietnamese staples like banh beo, sticky rice cakes topped with ground pork, mung beans, and fried shallots. \u201cIt\u2019s literally sitting on your palate longer.\u201dThe sticky banh beo with mung beans and fried shallots at Hai Hai\nPhoto by Matt Lien\u00a0But on restaurant menus these days and in this country, where different textural extremes\u2014\u201ccrispy\u201d nuts, \u201ccreamy\u201d polenta, \u201ccrunchy\u201d salt-rubbed vegetables, \u201cbraised\u201d and \u201cfall-apart-tender\u201d pork shoulder, and \u201ccharred\u201d toasts\u2014are all prized, chewy takes a back seat. Or worse.\u201cAs a chef, I\u2019ve been in situations where I can tell customers aren\u2019t going to like this, and it turns into a fight,\u201d says Deuki Hong, the chef behind the Sunday Bird and Sunday at the Museum, both in San Francisco. \u201cI\u2019ve seen some funny faces,\u201d Aikawa adds, remembering how he cautioned customers about one particular dish before they ordered: shiokara, super elastic squid fermented in its own guts. \u201cSometimes people freak out.\u201d They\u2019re not the only chefs I\u2019ve spoken with who experienced confrontations with diners, typically non-Asian ones, about food like this. The rejection can range from an elementary school\u2013level reaction (\u201cEw, what\u2019s that?!\u201d) to sullen stubbornness (\u201cYou won\u2019t get me to like tripe!\u201d) to straight-up bigoted responses (won\u2019t share those here).Why does chewy food elicit such extreme reactions? Maybe it\u2019s because, in western cuisines, chewy is largely associated with poor technique: something that\u2019s either so undercooked to the point that it\u2019s gummy, or simmered or seared until it\u2019s well-done and rubbery. Or maybe it\u2019s because very few things are acceptably chewy, and when they are approved, it\u2019s for their oddity alone: \u201cYou have this texture in gummy bears, but when it veers into unprocessed foods, it\u2019s like, \u2018Hey, it\u2019s not a novelty anymore,\u2019\u201d says Nicole Ponseca, the owner of Maharlika and Jeepney in New York City, whose bibingka, glutinous rice cakes with salted egg and guava jam, is the height of chew. But probably most of all, it\u2019s because it\u2019s just still so unfamiliar and, therefore, misunderstood.The thing that got me thinking about all this started with a beef tendon\u2014that 10 out of 10 rating on the chewy scale. I was at a $450-a-head dinner during a food festival in the South last summer, sharing a table with strangers. \u201cOoo, I don\u2019t really care for that,\u201d a guest seated next to me said, as she pushed away her plate draped with a single deli-meat-thin slice of tendon drizzled with orange-scented oil. Others joined in. I\u2019d already eaten mine, thinking, This is the good stuff!The beef tendon charcuterie at Mister Jiu's\nPhoto by Pete LeeThe dish was the work of Brandon Jew, the chef and owner of Mister Jiu\u2019s in San Francisco. The blanched, braised, then quickly cooled and cut tendon was his take on the Chinese charcuterie you get at the beginning of a fancy multicourse banquet at weddings or big family reunions. The luxury items. The kind of thing my Cantonese in-laws would quickly pass to me as soon as they hit the table, showing their love by offering me the first pick.\u201cI wondered how that went over,\u201d Jew said with a laugh, after I told him what happened at my table. \u201cI purposely brought that dish because I thought people probably hadn\u2019t had tendon like this before. I wanted to show people why we love this texture as a delicacy.\u201dBut our collective love for these dishes is more than just a celebration of East and Southeast Asian cuisines: The texture itself reflects the ingenuity of the cooks behind them. Instead of muting the natural bounce of ingredients\u2014like, for instance, the tendency to simmer turkey giblets in gravy or fry them to tender submission come Thanksgiving\u2014they play it up.In Vietnam, the signature springiness of nem, a sour pork sausage, comes from the addition of shredded, boiled pork skin; Nguyen, of Hai Hai, can\u2019t seem to find any other alternative here in the States. In Laotian cuisine, chef Donny Sirisavath tells me, tapioca starch from cassava root and freshly ground rice flour ensures a mochi-like consistency for the noodles in khao piak, a chicken noodle soup he makes at Khao Noodle Shop in Dallas (one of this year\u2019s Hot 10 winners). In China, fish scraps have long been kneaded and slapped against the kitchen counter until aerated and sticky enough to roll into hefty, delightfully rubbery balls, a technique Jew still practices at his restaurant. Cooks in the past did this to both pricey ingredients (rice!) and humbler ones (less-than-ideal cuts of meat and fish, wheat, millet). And in turn, they turned these ingredients into delicacies that still inspire a sense of comfort and nostalgia for people like me, and shock\u2014and in some cases, rejection\u2014from others.And that\u2019s actually all part of why I love it: Chewiness is a texture that physically and philosophically challenges you. It forces you to figure out why you may (or may not) like it as a texture. It confronts deep-seated, subconscious ideas about what defines deliciousness. It demands\u2014literally\u2014you take your time with it, to consider it. But if nothing else, it\u2019s just fun to eat. You have to slurp, bite down hard, pull, and get messy. And when is the last time you got to have this much fun with your food?Explore Bon App\u00e9titAsianSoutheast AsianRestaurantsRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
