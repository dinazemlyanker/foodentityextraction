It\u2019s built on a combination of toasted nuts, creamy ricotta, and salty Parmesan, with a little kick coming from raw garlic and fresh oregano. You don\u2019t need a food processor, a mortar and pestle, or a blender\u2014in fact, the entire sauce comes together in the same bowl you can use for serving.Ingredients4 servings\u00bdcup walnutsKosher salt4oz. fresh ricottaZest of 1 lemon1garlic clove, finely grated2tsp. finely chopped oregano2oz. finely grated Parmesan (about 1\u00bd cups), plus more for serving\u00bccup extra-virgin olive oilFreshly ground black pepper1lb. tube- or rod-shaped pasta (such as rigatoni or spaghetti)PreparationStep 1Preheat oven to 350\u00b0. Toast walnuts on a rimmed baking sheet, tossing once, until golden brown, 6\u20138 minutes. Let cool, then finely chop. Bring a large pot of generously salted water to a boil.Step 2Vigorously mix walnuts, ricotta, lemon zest, garlic, oregano, and 2 oz. Parmesan in a large bowl until well combined. Add oil 1 Tbsp. or so at a time, stirring well after each addition, until all the oil is incorporated. Season pesto with salt and pepper.Step 3Cook pasta in pot of boiling water, stirring occasionally, until al dente. Scoop 1 cup pasta cooking liquid into bowl with pesto and stir gently to combine (it\u2019s okay if some of the pesto is still in small clumps). Using a spider, tongs, or slotted spoon, transfer pasta directly to bowl with pesto. Mix energetically until pesto thickens enough to lightly coat pasta, about 2 minutes; the pasta should have sauce clinging to it but there should also be some extra sauce that collects in bottom of bowl.Step 4Divide pasta among bowls and serve with more Parmesan alongside for sprinkling over.How would you rate White Pesto Pasta?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (80)Back to TopTriangleHaving read lots of the reviews, I tripled the garlic and oregano, went heavy on the pepper, and used chicken stock  to replace 3/4 of the pasta water. It was delicious!AnonymousNE Florida1/20/2022Made this a second time after a few months - this is genuinely a great dish if you use quality ingredients and play around with them. I used 2 garlic cloves and chilli flakes but otherwise followed the recipe. You end up definitely using more pasta water than 1 cup, especially if you don't serve straight away, so bear that in mind before throwing any away! Also use a bigger bowl for less collateral damage cleaning later. Otherwise this comes together relatively quickly once everything chopped and good to go :)AnonymousAustralia11/26/2021My son made this for a small family lunch. We all thought it delicious. Black pepper would make it more \u2018zingy\u2019 for those who need a bit more zing. I thought the balance of cheeses, nuts and lemon spot on, with fresh oregano the perfect complement. Can\u2019t wait to make it myself. AnnamirabilisOxford, UK10/24/2021Eh... incredibly bland. Added some lemon juice to try and bring out something, but even that didn't add much. Really confused by the aim of this dish...Anonymous10/24/2021This was a flavourful way to use up some wonderful fresh ricotta. I used 2 cloves of garlic, but would recommend just using 1. I had fresh garlic from the garden and 2 was too much. A great summer meal. Tricia Calgary8/30/2021How do I save this recipe?ericmueller551047/12/2021Creamy, rich and wonderful.  As others have suggested, the recipe is flexible and I just added parmesan and the pasta water until it was to my liking.  Used homemade ricotta and added a few extra cloves of garlic. Next time I would use a mortar and pestle to get a smoother sauce as it was a bit chunky - but still very yummy!\nThis would make a great \"company\" dishSpatula City 123Los Angeles, CA4/23/2021I added 3 LARGE cloves of garlic instead of the one & added a bit of extra oregano too. I was a bit short on the amount of parmesan (used a bit less than a cup) but it still turned out super flavorful and great, so I\u2019d say you have more leniency with the ingredients than you may think. The sauce was the perfect consistency for me with the full cup of pasta water too. This was a perfect way for me to use up the ricotta I had left over, and a pretty easy dinner!CarolineLos Angeles, CA2/25/2021There is a problem with the parmesan cheese measurement.   It says 2 oz or 1.5 cups of finely grated parm.   I weighed out 2 oz of shredded parm, put it in the mini-chopper to make it finely grated and it's maybe 1 cup max.   So, if someone only put 2 oz, you didn't have enough cheese.\n\nI agree with other reviews that the recipe, AS IS, is a bit bland.  There is no \"zing\".   I do like the flavor of the \"sauce\" when it's mixed up before water is added then mixed to the pasta.   Problem is it gets really thinned out when you mix in the water then mix it in the pasta.  So, when you're adding salt and pepper, it really needs to taste OVER salty and OVER peppery because it will be spread very thin.\n\nAnyway, my tips to turn this into a more flavorful zesty dish   (1) 3 cloves of garlic instead of 1  (2)  2 cups of finely grated parm or about 5 oz if you weigh it  (3) feel free to double the oregano.   (4) Go with 1/2 cup of water instead of a full cup.  The sauce was a bit watery.  (5) if your okay with spicy, a nice dose of red pepper flakes.\nEric MooneyTorrance, CA1/17/2021Can I use cottage cheese instead of Ricotta cheese ? Sandra from Norway Norway12/29/2020I am eating it now. I find it uninspired though I enjoyed Cara's amusing presentation! I can see why those who made additions like it, because that's what it needs. On its own, it's too unctuous and lacks the bold flavor a true pesto has. And while I'm for substitutes in a pesto like cheaper nuts  and different cheese, I really don't consider this a pesto at all but rather a white ricotta sauce. \nAnonymousGreat Barrington MA12/20/2020I don't know why everyone keeps saying this sauce lacks flavour: it's full of parm, nuts, oil, lemon zest, herbs, salt, pepper, raw garlic... What more flavourful things are there?\nI improved mine by frying up some cannellini beans and then adding them in when you heat the sauce with the pasta water. I also blanched some spinach and tossed that in. More colour and more vegetables never hurt anyone. I also sprinkled pine nuts on top, cuz y'boy loves him some CRONCH and TEXTURE.\nThanks Carla for a great recipe.LucasOttawa, Ontario11/22/2020Made this dish this evening and everyone liked it. Very simple and easy to make, doesn't take too long, tastes delicious. 5/5.AnonymousLondon, UK11/21/2020Very easy weeknight pasta. A splash of lemon juice would take this recipe from 4 stars to 5 stars. Ohioan6/20/2020We love this recipe! made it 3x and it's a staple at our house. I like to hand crush the walnuts into a paste in a mortar and pestle with 1/4 tsp salt. I also up the lemon zest and garlic and juice usually. I find that with the salt in the walnut paste, we don't need the pasta water - we like the pesto a little thicker. Next time - I'm going to whip the ricotta to make it fluffy. This is so good serve with sausage, roasted broccoli, or balsamic roasted tomatoes.
