But, as CEO Robert Wang told us at the end of last year, updates will be launching soon that include features you never saw coming. Behold the next-generation Instant Pot Max. Hitting stores this spring (official announcement TBD), the new model improves on the multi-tasking appliance, which can make quick and easy polenta, fast-forwarded Coq au Vin, and even yogurt.New features include (drumroll, please) canning, automatic stirring, new venting options, and a sleek new touch-screen update to the display. According to The Kitchn, the new Instant Pot will reach 15 pounds per square inch (also known as PSI, the unit of measure that determines pressure), which is typical for most pressure cookers but not for the OG cult favorite, which was designed to stay at a max of around 11.6 PSI. Automatic stirring is good news for set-and-forget risotto, and new options for automatic slow venting, a pulse of venting, or a quick-release vent address the needs of different dishes. All new features will make your life easier\u2014and isn\u2019t that what Instant Pot is all about? Plus, the touch screen. About time.Instant Pot Max will reportedly be available in May or June and will first be introduced in a 6-quart size only. The price tag is estimated to land around $200. If you\u2019re not willing to pay an extra $100 for the latest and greatest, there are still millions (probably) of recipes you can try out with the tried-and-true favorite (might we let Mark Bittman suggest a few?).Related: How I Turned Slow-Roasted Short Ribs Into Pressure Cooker Short RibsExplore Bon App\u00e9titInstant PotTrends + NewsRead MorecookingThis Is the Most Underrated Instant Pot FeatureBy Sarah JampelcultureInstant Pot's Nonstick Cooking Pot Is Finally Back In StockBy Elaheh NozaricultureHow to Clean Your Smelly Instant Pot Sealing RingBy Alex BeggsRecipes you want to make.
