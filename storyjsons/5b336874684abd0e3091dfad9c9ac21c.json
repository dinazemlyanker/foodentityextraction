Most visitors think they must eat sushi in the market, but this is an illusion\u2014good fish can be enjoyed anywhere in the city and often at a better price and with less interminable lines. Instead, eat the thing that can only be had at Tsujiki: gyu-don. Yes, you can find these bowls of beef, onion, and rice everywhere in Japan, but they\u2019re cheap pretenders compared to the rich stew made here. It\u2019s the difference of pizza from Di Fara\u2019s in Brooklyn versus the cheese-laden cardboard of a national chain. One is an act of love and one is an act of efficiency.ORDER THE: well, gyu-don. Its chief components are beef and onion, but they have been stewed in a stock that\u2018s been fortified with chocolaty hatcho miso, which is the addition that makes Kitsuneya\u2018s special. If you\u2018d like something with more intrigue, order the horumon-don, which is a bowl of stewed cow intestines over rice. Both can be gilded with the addition of a raw egg or ordered over a block of tofu instead of rice.THE VIBE IS: frenetic, like the market itself. Kitsuneya is a stall with only a few seats at the counter and a couple of standing metal tables on the sidewalk. It sits at the front of the outer market, so the traffic\u2014both human and motorized\u2014never stops.PRACTICAL STUFF: Open Monday to Saturday from 7 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. Closed Sundays,  some Wednesdays. No English menu is available and the staff does not speak English. The nearest subway stops are Tsukiji and Tsukijishijo.Photo by Xavier Girard Lacha\u00eeneA decidedly not-fishy reason to journey to Tsukiji fish market.\nPhoto by Xavier Girard Lacha\u00eeneKitsune-ya is not as much a restaurant as it is a stall with a few metal tables.\nBy Kee Byung-keunExplore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
