The trove was found in the home of Hadley and Paul Mowrer in Chocorua, New Hampshire, who were good friends of the Childs, when the Mowrer\u2019s house was sold in 2012. (Absolutely random detail: Hadley was Ernest Hemingway\u2019s first wife. How about that!) \u201cThe items were given to a local woman because she was a fan of Julia Child,\u201d said a spokesman for The Written Word Autographs, who is hosting the auction, \u201cand that woman has consigned the pieces to The Written Word Autographs for this auction.\u201dLet\u2019s take a look at what Julia Child souvenirs could be yours:Courtesy of The Written Word AutographsA photograph of Julia and Paul Child, and a handwritten poem to their friendsWith this photographic evidence, you can pretend your life\u2019s history included a delightful correspondence with your dear friends Paul and Julia. Remember that time they came to visit you in New Hampshire? And then they sent this adorable poem about a trivet for you to magnetize to the fridge for ALL TIME. (In actuality, this was a thank you note to Paul and Hadley Mowrer, who apparently gave the Childs a gift of a lovely little wooden trivet. Please note the awesome handwriting. Julia\u2019s? We can only guess. Though probably not.)The bidding starts at $400Courtesy of The Written Word AutographsA groovy ValentineYou have to admire the Childs\u2019 dedication to these wacky Valentines, year after year. They loved love! They loved each other! We could all use more of that. In this Valentine, please note the tall and leggy and naked cartoon versions of Julia and Paul.The bidding starts at $1,800Courtesy of The Written Word AutographsThe bubble bath Valentine, wowThis one is really special. I\u2019m...not sure what else to say. The caption on the back was written by the Childs\u2019 cat, Minette, and reads: \u201cDearest friends \u2013 I didn\u2019t care to get into this picture, so I pushed the button. Ever yours \u2013 Minette\u201d Meanwhile, my love for the Childs only grows.The bidding starts at $1,500Courtesy of The Written Word AutographsPostcardsOne note from P+J Child reads: \u201cIf we don\u2019t get word out of that wasteful Pastland pretty soon, you know what you can expect in the way of naked splendor.\u201d What I glean from this is, the Childs are waiting for the Mowers to write them, but then threaten some naked pics if they don\u2019t? Unclear, but nudity appears to be involved and I\u2019m endlessly intrigued.Another note mentions my favorite character, Minette, again as P&J write: \u201cDearest Hadley\u2026Sounds as though you were loving NH and very happy, with birds and everything\u2026Minettee says to keep feeding the birds so they will be fat for her arrival.\u201dThe bidding starts at $1,000 and $850, respectivelyYou can see more postcards and the full auction over here. Hold on to your apron strings, though, the bidding doesn\u2019t begin until May 19.Don\u2019t miss this: Rare Photos of Julia Child, Like You\u2019ve Never Seen Her BeforeExplore Bon App\u00e9titJulia ChildTrends + NewsRead MorecultureJulia Child, Like You've Never Seen Her BeforeBy Alex BeggsRecipes you want to make.
