When something\u2019s so easy you don\u2019t need one. In It\u2019s That Simple, we talk you through the dishes and drinks we make with our eyes closed. Today, chili crisp.Some people made sourdough in quarantine, but I made chili crisp. When my cravings and loneliness were at their highest, I looked inside my pantry and dreamed of crunch. I had only a few chili crisp ingredients, but I determinedly cobbled something together\u2014and I was surprised by how good it tasted. Now I always turn to that handful of ingredients when I make the condiment.Chili crisp can feature so many ingredients\u2014like crispy fried garlic, fennel seeds, scallions, and star anise\u2014that add all sorts of flavors. But I\u2019ve stripped down the crisp to its spicy, crunchy essentials. For me that\u2019s dried red chiles, roasted and salted soybeans or peanuts, and dried onion or shallot. With those three ingredients\u2014plus vegetable oil, salt, and sugar\u2014I get a crisp that\u2019s hot, salty, sweet, and, thanks to the soybeans or peanuts, full of texture. When I\u2019m in the mood, I like to add Sichuan peppercorns, sesame seeds, and sesame oil so the crisp is extra fragrant\u2014but those are optional not elemental.When it comes to the crisp-to-oil ratio, I like much, much more crisp than oil. The key to a chili crisp that\u2019s so crunchy it\u2019s like a spicy trail mix? A huge number of soybeans. When I thought about why I enjoy this chili crisp so much, I realized that it\u2019s like a little baby version of Lao Gan Ma\u2019s Chili Oil With Fermented Soybeans, which has a much longer ingredient list.Here\u2019s how to make my chili crisp:\u00a0Pulverize \u00bd cup dried red chiles into little flakes in a food processor or spice grinder. (I use Chinese chiles, but it\u2019s probably okay if you use other types. If you don\u2019t have whole chiles, substitute about \u2153 cup crushed red pepper flakes.) Smash\u00a0 \u00bc\u2013\u2153 cup roasted and salted soybeans (more soybeans = more crunch) into randomly-sized pieces with the flat of a knife or a rolling pin. It\u2019s okay\u2014even good\u2014if some remain whole while others are closer to the size of rice grains. If you don\u2019t have soybeans on hand, you can use roasted and salted peanuts; the crisp will crunch just as good.Then, heat \u00be cup vegetable oil\u2014I like soybean or peanut oil\u2014in a saucepan over medium-high. Once the oil is hot, reduce heat to medium, add \u00bd cup minced dried onion or shallot and 2 tsp. salt, and cook, stirring frequently, until the alliums are brown, about 3\u20135 minutes. Add the chile flakes, soybeans or peanuts, and 1 tsp. sugar. Add 1 tsp. Sichuan peppercorns, if you crave that tingling sensation. Cook for about a minute to release the spicy flavors. If you want to amp up the heat, simmer for about 3\u20135 minutes more, until the oil looks redder and redder. Add a splash of sesame oil for extra fragrance. Turn off the heat and stir in 2 tsp. sesame seeds, if you\u2019re using them.After everything cools down, transfer the chili crisp to a sealed container and stick it in the fridge. Pour it over everything you eat (maybe even things you don\u2019t eat?). It\u2019s great for congee, tofu, or soups\u2014all of which highlight its glorious texture\u2014but you can also smother noodles and dumplings, roast chicken (my personal favorite), green salads, eggs, and maybe even sourdough\u2014if you\u2019re still making it, that is.Explore Bon App\u00e9titIt's That SimpleRecipes you want to make.
