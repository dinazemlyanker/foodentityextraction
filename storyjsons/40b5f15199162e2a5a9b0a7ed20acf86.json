I know\u2014it\u2019s gross. But it\u2019s also real life. In my experience as a person living on the northeast coast of the United States, as soon as the weather even hints at the autumnal transition, my hands dry up and wither just like the fading leaves on the trees. I\u2019m being dramatic because it\u2019s dramatic! Being in the kitchen all day exposes my hands to extra washing for dishes that need doing, blasting heat from the stovetop and oven, and little scrapes and burns\u2014and all of that wreaks havoc on my digits.When something terrible is happening to me, including but not limited to bloody knuckles, I like to involve my sister. My sister is a ceramicist. Everything I\u2019m complaining about, she has it worse because working with clay literally strips her hands of every ounce of moisture they have. After I texted her, she was quick to respond.\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you using Egyptian Magic?\u201d she wrote back. \u201cYou need. Fix everything.\u201d\u201cWhat is???\u201d I replied.Then she just sent me a link to buy it, and soon after I was head over heels in love with my skincare savior, Egyptian Magic cream. I can\u2019t confirm or deny that this salve is truly \u201cthe ancient Egyptians\u2019 secret\u201d as the label professes, but I can tell you that the buttery combination of olive oil, beeswax, honey, bee pollen, propolis, and royal jelly is definitely Magic. Texture-wise, it feels like a lighter, more fluid Vaseline, but it melts instantly when you rub it between your palms, and it absorbs into the skin instead of sitting like a grease slick on top. When I got that first jar, I dabbed it onto my inflamed knuckles and my lips, and overnight it seemed like those chapped spots showed signs of healing. Good stuff, I thought.It was a slippery slope from \u201cnever heard of it\u201d to \u201ccan\u2019t live without it.\u201d There\u2019s no inch of skin I won\u2019t put Egyptian Magic cream on. I use it to remove eye makeup and to calm my son\u2019s itchy elbow creases. I work it into my knees and cuticles, shins and ankles. After bouts with winter sniffles, I rub it all around my nose, which gets irritated and flaky after using too many tissues. During the driest, coldest, wind-whipped, moisture-starved, ashiest day of winter, I thought maybe I should just slather it all over my face and see what happened. Then I rubbed what was left on my hands into the ends of my hair. I do that a lot now, and I never break out. I\u2019ve scooped a sidecar amount into a little travel-sized jar, which I keep in my bag, so I can use it on the go. Once, I boarded a plane and schmeared Egyptian Magic up my nose as a protective barrier between me and the airborne germs. Did I get sick? No, I did not.This winter, you might think you need to find another good moisturizer. But what you need\u2014what we all need\u2014is just a little Magic.Buy it: Egyptian Magic All Purpose Skin Cream, $22 on AmazonAll products featured on Bonappetit.com are independently selected by our editors.
