This week: the chicken meatball recipe that associate social media manager Emily Schultz just couldn't live without.You know those people who \u201ccan\u2019t day-drink all Sunday with you\u201d because they\u2019re too busy shopping, cooking and prepping for their meals all week? Yeah, well, I am not one of those people. I want to be! I\u2019d love to not spend $12 on cafeteria sushi every day! Or totally forget to eat lunch and then wonder why I can\u2019t focus at 3 p.m.! But, alas, most Sundays roll around and I find myself watching an entire season of It\u2019s Always Sunny in Philadelphia rather than dragging myself to the grocery store. That is, until these chicken meatballs rolled into my life.I decided to make these meatballs on a Monday night\u2014we\u2019re working on the Sunday meal prep thing here, people!\u2014for my roommate and I. When I was finished, we each had dinner and two full servings to bring for lunch for the next two days, which I call a MAJOR SUCCESS. Let\u2019s get rockin\u2019 and rollin'.A few notes before we get started. There are a couple of ingredients on this list that aren\u2019t mandatory, but are pretty freaking genius. The first is the feta IN BRINE! The brine is important because it's used in the breadcrumb mixture for meatballs. It\u2019s not like your meatballs are going to walk off your pan in protest if you subbed the brine for water, but it adds a wonderful salty kick that balances out the sweetness of the roasted tomatoes and creaminess of the chickpeas. The other next-level addition to these meatballs is harissa, a North African spice paste that kind of looks like tomato paste and has a slightly smoky spiciness; it kicks everything up a notch, and makes these meatballs taste a lot fancier than they are.Once you buy a tube of harissa, you won't be able to live without it. Pinky swear.\nOK, let\u2019s actually make the darn things now. First, you're going to make the binder that will turn the ground chicken into proper meat-a-balls. (Cue extreme pizza-box-chef kiss face.) Combine an egg, some bread crumbs (panko, plz!), a good splash of that feta brine, crumbled feta, chopped parsley, and olive oil. Give it all a good smash-smash with a fork until it looks like it\u2019s all become one beautiful mess, then add grated garlic, salt, and pepper, and do a little more smashing. The ground chicken goes in, and then you mix it all up with your bare hands! Don\u2019t be scared of getting your hands up in it. (Though, I would advise against making these on a date because ground chicken all over your hands isn\u2019t romantic in my opinion. Make this instead. Let the meatball mixture chill out for a second, wash your chicken-y hands, and move on to the other stuff.Now, pour some drained chickpeas and cherry tomatoes onto a baking sheet. (Amanda, my lovely coworker and editor of Healthyish, subbed the tomatoes with cubed sweet potatoes for a heartier side during the dead of winter; do what you feel!). Then you add more of that harissa, olive oil, salt and pepper right there on the dang sheet pan and toss to combine. Cool! Now your hands are covered in oil and harissa. It\u2019s almost like a fancy hand scrub\u2014don't bother washing your hands, just go with it.That salty, milky feta brine is where it's at.\nYou\u2019re going to start rolling your meatballs and plunking them into the spaces between the chickpeas and tomatoes. (The oil on your hands will help the chicken from sticking to your hands. Genius!) I like rolling the meatballs golf-ball sized, which will leave you with a lot of meatballs. (This is about meal prepping in case you forgot) Then, into the oven they go for about 15 minutes while you combine feta and parsley in a small bowl to create a garnish for your finished meatballs. Once the meatballs are mostly cooked, you're going to finish them under the broiler for about 8 minutes\u2014that'll ensure that they're golden brown on the outside and super juicy inside. Once these guys come out of the oven, let them sit for a minute and then sprinkle that fancy feta-parsley mixture over eeeeeeeeverything.You can eat them with flatbread, over something sturdy like kale, or straight up. I eat the spicy chickpea-tomato business right out of the fridge because cold roasted vegetables are basically a food group to me, so they are my ideal lunch al desko. They\u2019ll turn you into a meal prepper faster than you can say cafeteria sushi.Get the Recipe:Sheet Pan Chicken Meatballs with Tomatoes and ChickpeasHarissa, a spicy North African paste of chiles, garlic, and spices, is available in many large grocery stores and Middle Eastern markets\u2014some brands come in tubes, others are sold in jars. If you can\u2019t find it, though, substitute by mixing together your favorite hot sauce, tomato paste, a pinch or two of ground cumin, and a drizzle of olive oil. Keep playing with the ratios until you have a medium-spicy paste.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titMeatballBasicallyNever FailFetaHarissaRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
