Think oysters, foie gras torchon, seared sweetbreads, roasted bone marrow, and lots and lots of meat.ORDER THE: selection of fresh oysters to start, impeccably shucked and elegantly served with all the accoutrements. Although the chalkboard menu changes constantly, you can still count on seeing certain crowd-pleasers, like the legendary lobster spaghetti and the marjolaine dessert, an elaborately layered assemblage of hazelnut sponge and mousse.THE VIBE IS: a party. The restaurant is a hodgepodge of multiple rooms inside a 19th-century building, and the dining room is candlelit, cozy, and buzzed. We guarantee you will leave fuller, and probably drunker, than you expected (or perhaps ever thought possible).PRACTICAL STUFF: Open Tuesday to Saturday 5:30 to 10:30 p.m., but many tables linger a little longer to drink. Closed Sunday and Monday. Reservations are notoriously tough, especially on weekends, so try to reserve months in advance on Resy if you can.\u2014Claire SaffitzPhoto by Dominique LafondPhoto by Dominique LafondWE ALSO LOVELe Vin PapillonLittle Burgundy\u2019s natural wine hubAu Pied de CochonGet your fill of foie gras and other Quebecois luxuries at this Plateau legendLo\u00efcAll roads (and great p\u00e9t-nat) lead to this Saint-Henri wine barExplore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
