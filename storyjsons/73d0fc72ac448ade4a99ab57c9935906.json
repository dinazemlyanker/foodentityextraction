Next up is Maria Qamar, an artist whose cheeky illustrations electrify some of our favorite restaurants.If you\u2019ve watched \u201cThe Mindy Project\u201d or been in the dining room of stylish Indian restaurants like Bombay Bread Bar in New York and Besharam in San Francisco, you\u2019ve probably seen Maria Qamar\u2019s work. Her cheeky illustrations blend comic-book-style pop art with her own experiences growing up in an Indian household in Canada. \u201cI put salt in her chai,\u201d says a smug aunty in one illustration. \u201cI spilled eggnog on my Christmas saree. Who will love me now?!\u201d exclaims a girl in a headband and bindi in another.Qamar was born in Karachi, Pakistan\u2014her father is from Bangladesh, and her mother is from Gujarat\u2014but the family moved to Canada when she was nine years old. At school, she was bullied for being brown. \u201cI never expected that negativity,\u201d she says. She dealt with the tough times by drawing comics about these experiences, \u201cbut I would change the outcome,\u201d she says. \u201cIn my comics, I always got the last laugh.\u201dHer hilarious illustrations quickly caught the attention of the Desi community, particularly those of my generation, who related closely with her depictions of gossiping aunties (\u201cShe stole my husband, but she can never steal this recipe!\u201d) overbearing parents (\u201cOur daughter didn\u2019t pick up the phone, Vinay! She\u2019s obviously dead!!!\u201d), and cultural appropriation (\u201cIs this gori wearing a bindi again?!\u201d).Food is a common theme in Qamar\u2019s artwork because it played a central role in her upbringing. \u201cIf I weren\u2019t doing art, I\u2019d probably be cooking,\u201d she says, so making illustrations for restaurants (and my cookbook) felt natural to her. Her chef collaborators, who include Heena Patel and Floyd Cardoz, \u201care doing for dining what I am doing in my art: trying to introduce people to something new that they wouldn\u2019t find in the usual Indian joint,\u201d she says.We talked to Qamar about comfort food, Indian soap operas, and why the fruit in Pakistan is so much better than it is here.My comfort food growing up was\u2026 dhokla [a Gujarati snack made of fermented rice and lentils] and Bengali fish fries. In Pakistan, we ate tons of grilled meats, including parts of the animal that people over here wouldn\u2019t touch like chicken throat and goat tongue.A big influence on my artwork and humor is\u2026Indian soap operas. They were in the background every night when my mom came home from work. There would be drama between two women, and you could hear them crying in the background. It is oddly comforting.One of my first doodles was about\u2026. me and all these bullies at school. I released a bunch of birds on their face.Something people misunderstand about Indian food\u2026 is that there\u2019s more to order than butter chicken. Indians make so many great things! We do need better representations of what Indian food is.Cooking is important to me because\u2026  it grounded me when everything was chaos outside. I would come home and my mom would make me khichdi and I would feel fine. Cooking pulled me out of a depression when I was 19.I learned to cook by\u2026calling my mom and asking her how to make certain foods. She had been making the dishes for so long she would skip the details. So I would taste her version and then try to break it down.My latest cooking discovery is\u2026 biryani but with cauliflower rice. It did legitimately taste like biryani. I was very shook.One food I really miss from living in Pakistan is\u2026 fruit! I grew up eating a lot of fruits that are impossible to find here: custard apples, mangoes, chikoos.My favorite thing to snack on while I work is\u2026 banana chips or cashews. I am the kind of person who will go to the grocery store and buy the pre-cut trays of fruit because I am a giant baby.I create art\u2026for my own mental health, not to accomplish anything.One of the most rewarding parts of my art is\u2026knowing that there are people who are invested in it, who feel seen.The most fun part about doing illustrations for restaurants was\u2026. \u201cgetting free reign, for Bombay Bread Bar, on the mural [which showcases the ten-foot-tall faces of a Desi man and woman, posed side by side on the back wall of the restaurant]. With Besharam, it wasn\u2019t just a mural, it was the menu [featuring Qamar\u2019s signature Desi woman giving sass], the plates [bedecked with phrases like \u201cSave the drama for your amma\u201d], the neon sign [bright pink, with the restaurant\u2019s name scrawled in neat cursive]. I got to get my art direction on.\u00a0I probably wouldn\u2019t ever want to be a chef because...people are way harsher with food than they are with art. With art, people are like, \u201cI don\u2019t get it, fine.\u201d With food, it\u2019s make-or-break. It takes balls to be a chef today.The future is\u2026 the younger generation. They are bolder, and they are not afraid. They are growing up in an age where they are able to say, \u201cNo, I am not doing this. You are racist, you are problematic.\u201d That\u2019s exciting.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishPerson of InterestIndianInterviewsRead MoreLifestyleNew Orleans Chef Nina Compton Isn't Afraid of the Dish PitBy Kristin BraswellRecipes you want to make.
