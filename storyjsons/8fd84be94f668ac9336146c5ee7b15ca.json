But since the Messermeister Kawashima 6-inch utility knife entered my life a few months ago, it\u2019s been pretty much glued to my hand.Photo by Emma FishmanMessermeister Kawashima 6-Inch Utility Knife$180 at Amazon$180 at MessermeisterThe Messermeister Kawashima utility knife perfectly epitomizes its name. It\u2019s shorter and nimbler than a chef\u2019s knife but more robust than a paring knife, so it makes quick work of breakfast fruits like kiwis, mangos, and avocados. But it can also handle larger produce like melons, sweet potatoes, and pineapples with beauty and grace, and the curved handle and slightly angled blade allow for that see-saw motion you want for dicing onions and chopping piles of fresh herbs.It\u2019s also scarily sharp. According to Messermeister, the Kawashima knives have the sharpest blades they\u2019ve ever produced, made from powdered steel by third-generation knife artisans in Seki, the knife-producing capital of Japan. They\u2019re designed by and named for Shoichi Kawashima, an iconic Japanese bladesmith. I will say that the first time I used it to slice raw chicken thighs for a stir-fry, I gasped at how seamlessly the blade went through.I\u2019ve been at BA long enough to know that when it comes to kitchen cutlery there are only three types of knives you really need to buy. But I\u2019ve also learned that knives are intensely personal. Maybe your perfect knife is a cleaver or a petty knife. As for me, I\u2019m not doing away with my 8-inch chef\u2019s knife (a Messermeister Meridian Elite in case you\u2019re curious) any time soon. I need it for the big jobs like carving whole chickens and halving butternut squash. And there are still tomatoes to contend with: small serrated knife, I\u2019m looking at you. But this utility knife can do pretty much everything else. Now I just have to figure out how to keep it sharp.Explore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingHighly RecommendCultureRecipes you want to make.
