I\u2019d have friends over for sit-down coursed dinners, raucous weekend house parties, and everything in between. Wine would flow. There was only one problem: No one living in a New York City apartment has room for more than eight wine glasses. Where would I keep all that extra stemware? My Regency-era china cabinet, next to luncheon plates and a soup tureen? And so the first guests to arrive (or the ones I thought least likely to break my Schott Zwiesels) would receive grown-up wine glasses, and the rest would get whatever was available\u2014tumblers if they were lucky, chipped coffee mugs if they weren\u2019t.By the grace of Anthony Fauci, I will host again in 2021, and this time, I\u2019m prepared. These Bormioli Rocco wine glasses have a \u201970s Italian modern vibe that makes me want to sip Franciacorta in my sunken living room. Chunky with vertical sides offset by rounded curves, they call to mind Massimo Vignelli\u2019s iconic Heller dinnerware except they\u2019re made of hefty tempered glass. I own a set of the somewhat coupe-shaped 8-ounce glasses\u2014technically dessert glasses, according to the manufacturer\u2014which are perfect for effervescent p\u00e9t-nats and olive-garnished spritzes. If you\u2019re looking for something more the size of traditional stemware, they also come in 9.5- and 11.75-ounce versions. They\u2019re remarkably sturdy, so I can throw them in the dishwasher or hand one to my clumsiest friend (you know who you are) without fear of chipped rims or snapped stems.But the best part about these glasses is that they stack, and not in the way that my mismatched Tupperware kind-of-not-really fits together. These glasses nest snugly so you can carry four at a time without fear of them toppling over, and when they\u2019re not in use\u2014which is often these days\u2014they take up minimal real estate on my kitchen shelf, one on top of the other like a tower of acrobats.At six bucks a pop, they\u2019re affordable enough that I\u2019m considering buying another set to keep stacked in deep storage in the corner of a closet until they\u2019re needed. As soon as I\u2019m able to safely gather my loved ones around me, you can be sure there will be a bacchanalian party\u2014and this time everyone will have a proper wine glass.Photo by Emma FishmanSet of 6 Stackable Wine Glasses$39 at Food52Explore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingHighly RecommendRecipes you want to make.
