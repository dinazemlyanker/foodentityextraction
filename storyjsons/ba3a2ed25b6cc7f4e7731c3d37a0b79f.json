See our past recommendations here!I crave a good crunch in the morning. I\u2019ve turned to everything from sugary cereals to homemade granola, but my new favorite staple is Lil Bucks sprouted buckwheat. The nutty, gluten-free, protein-rich seeds (also known as groats) have quickly become my go-to topping for yogurt bowls, along with fresh fruit, cacao nibs, and bee pollen. Come winter I know it\u2019ll make a great garnish for oatmeal and pancakes\u2014a final flourish after adding maple syrup.With six grams of complete plant protein and five grams of fiber per serving, Lil Bucks are certainly healthier than anything you'll find in the cereal aisle. Sprouting the buckwheat by soaking, then dehydrating at low temperatures allows for better nutrient absorption by neutralizing enzyme inhibitors and makes the groats easier to digest. The original variety has just one ingredient\u2014organic sprouted buckwheat\u2014while the cacao and matcha flavors are lightly sweetened with maple syrup and dusted with either organic maca root powder or organic hemp protein powder for an extra superfood boost.Buckwheat is also pretty sustainable. It\u2019s a cover crop that improves soil quality by adding nutrients, attracting pollinators, and suppressing weeds. It grows quickly even in colder climates like Minnesota and North Dakota, where Lil Bucks has so far purchased 28,000 pounds\u2014or 700 acres\u2014of buckwheat from Minn-Dak Growers. Typically, Lil Bucks come in 6-ounce bags, but if you\u2019re looking to minimize packaging, they also sell bulk one-pound bags with a year-long shelf life.Lil Bucks are such a versatile pantry staple that I\u2019ve started sprinkling them into all my meals. They make a great substitute for croutons on salad or soup and are a wonderfully crunchy coating for hand-rolled chocolate truffles. But despite these occasional appearances in lunch, dinner and dessert, I\u2019ll always save some for breakfast.Photo courtesy of Bubble GoodsLil Bucks Sprouted Buckwheat 3-Pack$17 at AmazonExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishShoppingBuckwheatBreakfastHealthyish Loves ItRead MorecultureI'll Never Run Out of Alt Milk Thanks to This ConcentrateBy Aliza AbarbanelRecipes you want to make.
