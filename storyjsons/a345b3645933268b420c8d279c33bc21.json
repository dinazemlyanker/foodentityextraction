Not because you don\u2019t love your wall decor, but because you (naturally) expect it to always be there. You\u2019d walk around feeling uneasy, knowing something was missing without being able to put a finger on exactly what that something was. And that is exactly what I\u2014a certified beer enthusiast\u2014feel when it comes to non-alcoholic beer. Or at least I did, until I started drinking Athletic Brewing Company\u2019s Upside Dawn Golden Ale.I heard about it last year from my friend Benjamin Pratt, co-owner of the always excellent beer bar As Is in New York City. He\u2019s also a frequent marathon runner and, at the time, he was training for a massive race and swore off booze until he finished. Now, I am not a marathon runner...but I do take a month off from drinking every January\u2014just as impressive, right?\u2014so I took mental note of his serious endorsement of a non-alcoholic beer.Then, earlier this month, I bought a six-pack of Athletic\u2019s golden ale\u2014and I\u2019ve bought a couple more since. This beer tasted and felt and smelled like the beers I love to drink the other 11 months of the year. It has a pleasant hoppy bitterness, layered with notes of lemon peel, fresh cut grass, and black tea. The yeast strain is light and bready, like a fresh baguette, and the body of the beer is soft and creamy up front with a crisp, clean finish that brings the can immediately back to your lips. I didn\u2019t have to think twice: That sense of something missing wasn\u2019t there.How do they do it? In short, I don\u2019t know. Only the Athletic team\u2014led by founder Bill Shufelt and head brewer John Walker\u2014does. At their Connecticut brewery, they developed a proprietary (read: secret) fermentation process to remove alcohol from their brew, which they tell me no other producer of non-alcoholic beer has done. But really, you don\u2019t need to know the science behind the process to appreciate its intent: A zero-alcohol beer that lives up to the same nerdy standards as regular stuff. And they did.All of this is really just to say: Don\u2019t steal the art off the walls of my apartment. And don\u2019t serve me a non-alcoholic beer that falls short of the real thing. After drinking Athletic for the past few weeks, I\u2019ll notice.Buy it: Athletic Brewing\u2019s Upside Dawn Golden Ale, $28 for a 12-pack on AmazonAll products featured on Bonappetit.com are independently selected by our editors.
