It\u2019s a simple cocktail that\u2019s literally just booze and mixer, but it has a cult following among serious bartenders throughout the country. \u201cIt\u2019s an exercise in simplicity,\u201d says Bobby Heugel, the bartender behind Tongue-Cut Sparrow in Houston. For his own house highball, he studied the best versions in Japan, like the ice-less version at Bar Track in Tokyo, and worked on his recipe for over a year. \u201cHow cold is the whisky? Does the sparkling water have the right texture from the carbonation and subtlety so it doesn\u2019t cover up the particular delicacies of Japanese whisky? How cold is the glass? Lemon twist or not?\u201d he rattles off all the questions he considered during R&D. \u201cI love Japanese highballs because of how simple they are, and that simplicity is a real test for bars that claim to make exquisite cocktails.\u201d Here, Heugel breaks down every little detail that goes into Tongue-Cut Sparrow\u2019s near-perfect version.The GlassThe HS (hard strong) glass is made by famed Japanese glassware brand Toyo-Sasaki and was selected by Heugel for its delicate yet sturdy build.The WaterHeugel uses Mountain Valley Spring Water because he believes it most closely mirrors the softer, less minerally flavor of Japanese sparkling waters.The WhiskeyIt\u2019s got one and a half ounces of Suntory\u2019s bargain brand Toki, which has become the industry standard for highballs. (Other Suntory whiskies are too expensive and rare.) It\u2019s kept in the freezer until needed.The IceMost highballs take ice. Heugel opts for none; he likes the attractive simplicity in this presentation. But the drink is still plenty cold thanks to the chilled whisky.The TwistA lemon twist is optional, but Heugel likes to garnish with one in the summer because it brightens the drink in the Texas heat.Explore Bon App\u00e9titCocktailSummer DrinksDish DecodedRead MorecookingKick Off Summer with a Big Ol' Pitcher of Pimm's CupsBy Al Cullitoncooking4 Easy Tequila (and Mezcal!)
