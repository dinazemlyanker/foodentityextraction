I could\u2019ve felt disappointment (Anna, I promise I have amazing outfits!), I could\u2019ve felt embarrassed (Anna, I really am a stand-up citizen!), but really, I was thrilled to be in the presence of Vogue\u2019s editor in chief wearing my most prized piece of clothing: my It\u2019s-It swag.I lived in San Francisco for three months in my early twenties, a trying time of BIG LIFE CHANGES, but the moment I discovered that freezer treat\u2014two oatmeal cookies surrounding a slab of ice cream covered entirely in a generous shell of chocolate\u2014I knew it was all worth it. Years later, and now on the East Coast, everyone around me still knows about my adoration, even despite the vast distance between myself and a highly accessible supply. I wear the brand\u2019s merchandise everywhere I go. I\u2019ve worn it to a fancy New Year\u2019s Eve party. I\u2019ve worn it to important meetings. I\u2019ve wore it on a really great first date.To know me is to know my dessert allegiances. It\u2019s-It are it, and I\u2019ll wear it loud and proud.Buy It: It\u2019s-It Gray Pull-Over Sweatshirt, $40 at itsiticecream.com.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendShoppingRecipes you want to make.
