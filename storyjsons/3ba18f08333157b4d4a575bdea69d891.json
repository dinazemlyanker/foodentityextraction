This holiday season it\u2019s all but guaranteed that restaurants will be a lot quieter, but the good news is that Martinez finally gets to join her family for their most hallowed food tradition: preparing Venezuelan hallacas, savory corn dough filled with a savory meat stew and traditionally eaten around Christmas and the New Year.Making hallacas is a full-day project that\u2019s best tackled with a group. In the Martinez household, every family member has a task. Claudia\u2019s dad or grandmother always prepares the guiso, the tender shredded chicken and beef stew that comprises the bulk of the filling. One person slicks scoops of vibrant orange achiote-stained masa dough onto banana leaves, then passes them around the table to get filled.Hard to stop at one.\nPhoto by Yudi ElaClaudia\u2019s grandma adds a spoonful of guiso; Claudia adds olives and capers; her sister adds a few raisins. Finally, each hallaca gets wrapped up in the fragrant leaves and tied with twine like a tiny present, ready to boil for a late Christmas Eve dinner.\u00a0The Martinez family seldom makes fewer than a hundred hallacas at a time because they\u2019ll take many to friends and family during the holidays. This scaled-down (step-by-step) version of their family recipe makes just under 20, enough for a big dinner plus leftovers you can freeze for another day. If you find yourself with leftover masa and stew, do as the Martinezes do: Make arepas with guiso and fried eggs for breakfast on Christmas Day.\u00a0Catch Claudia on December 23rd at the last of her\u00a0Cafe\u0301 Claudia\u00a0pop-up series at the Hotel Clermont in Atlanta. She\u2019ll be selling these very hallacas and Christmas-themed pastries, with all proceeds going to Casa Alterna.\u00a0Get the Recipe:HallacasIn this Venezuelan holiday dish, masa is filled with a shredded chicken and beef stew, then wrapped in fragrant banana leaves and steamed\u2014like a tiny present.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titHoliday 2020Recipes you want to make.
